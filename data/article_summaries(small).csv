"New York police are concerned drones could become tools for terrorists, and are investigating ways to stop potential attacks. Until now police haven't acknowledged drones as a potential weapon, but the NYPD has now said the technology has advanced enough that someone could use them to carry out an air assault using chemical weapons and firearms. Police want to develop technology which will allow them to take control of drones as well as scan the skies for them before major events. The NYPD says drones carrying explosives are the number one threat as they investigate ways to stop attacks . Deputy Chief Salvatore DiPace, left, was concerned about an incident last year where a drone was landed in front of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 'could have took the chancellor and her people out' A drone which was flown over a packed football stadium in Manchester, England, just over a week ago, resulting in the suspected pilot being arrested . They are consulting with the military and members of its counterterrorism, bomb squad, emergency services and aviation units are working on a plan to counter weaponized drones. The NYPD hasn't received any intelligence indicating there is an imminent threat, but has become increasingly concerned over the last year. Deputy Chief Salvatore DiPace told CBS News: 'We've looked at some people that have jury-rigged these drones to carry guns, to carry different types of explosives if they wanted to; there's just so many possibilities that we're very worried about.' Mr Dipace said police had also seen video showing how accurate an attack from a drone could be: 'We've seen some video where the drone was flying at different targets along the route and very accurately hitting the targets with the paintball. The NYPD now sees a drone carrying explosives as the number one threat. Mr DiPace's concerns follow an incident in Germany last year where a drone was able to land just in front of German Chancellor Angela Merkel as she delivered a speech. The drone, circled, landed in front of Ms Merkel as she delivered a speech sin Germany sparking fears that the device could easily be used to commit a terrorist act . He said: 'If you really think about what could have happened there, the drone hit its target right on the mark and could have took the chancellor and her people out.' There has been a dramatic increase of incidents involving drones in New York City in the last year, with 40 recorded. In some cases unmanned aircraft systems or drones had flown into airspace being used by NYPD helicopters. In one incident this summer, a drone which was almost 800 feet off the ground, nearly collided with a police helicopter. NYPD Aviation Unit Member, Sergeant Antonio Hernandez said: 'We're flying in the dark; we have night-vision goggles on, we're trying to get a job done and then the next thing you know we see this drone come up to our altitude.'","Police have investigated criminals who have rigged guns to drones .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Perhaps Australian porn star Angela White thought she was bringing the ultimate steamy study fantasy to life when she and a partner secretly filmed sex acts in the library of La Trobe University in Melbourne. The video is believed to have been shot this year, while the library was open for use and has sparked outrage from the university and the ire of police. Despite the presence of nearby students, White starts the video by revealing herself between bookshelves, as reported by the Herald Sun. Raunchy: Angela White and a partner secretly filmed sex acts in the library of La Trobe University in Melbourne . White and her onscreen lover then move to nearby desks, with her partner keeping lookout. A La Trobe University spokesman said it was shocked and appalled by the 'brazen act'. 'We knew nothing about the video footage until we were recently informed by some of our students.'Permission was not sought, nor would it have been given. If requested we would assist fully with any police investigation.' A Victoria Police spokeswoman said if the pair were caught in the act, they could have faced charges including wilful and obscene exposure. 'Brazen act': La Trobe was unaware of the video had been filmed and was left outraged by the embarrassment . On the back of the controversy, Whiteâ€™s Dutch-based production company AGW Entertainment issued a statement addressing the incident and has since removed the video, which had been published online. 'AGW Entertainment B.V. regrets that the filming and/or posting of the video in question may have offended members of the public,â€ .","Porn star Angela White secretly filmed sex acts with a partner in a university library .

"This was, Sergio Garcia conceded, much like being hunted by Tiger, complete with the roars that  provided the first sign of danger. Only this time here it was Rory McIlroy who was terrorising the two golfers ahead of him. McIlroy who was drawing deafening applause from the crowds in the group behind. For Garcia and Rickie Fowler, it made the final few holes of a dramatic third round here in Hoylake all the more torturous. As Fowler dropped a shot on 17, his third bogey in four holes, McIlroy could be heard making eagle on the adjacent 16th. Under pressure: Sergio Garcia and Rickie Fowler during the third round on Saturday . As the American and the Spaniard then made their way across the third fairway to the scorer's tent, there came another roar for yet another eagle on 18 for the Ulsterman. Fowler had just birdied 18 but even that failed to stop the gap between first and second widening. Defending champion Phil Mickelson felt he missed a good opportunity to move up the leaderboard on day three. Mickelson was among the day's first starters, teeing off at 9am, but failed to take advantage of unexpectedly good conditions. The lefthander fired a 71 to lie 15 shots behind leader Rory McIlroy overnight and said: 'We had beautiful scoring conditions, first group off. If we could have shot seven, eight, nine under par it probably was out there. It was as easy as I've seen the course play. We could have made some noise. 'It could have been a lot lower and I let a lot of shots slide.' Mickelson, who came through the field to win with a final-round 66 at Muirfield last year, opened here with rounds of 74 and 70. Garcia admitted afterwards that playing McIlroy in this kind of form is as daunting as waging war against Woods in his prime; an almost futile exercise however well those in  the chasing pack might be playing. 'I don't think Rory has been as consistent as Tiger was for so many years, but when he's at his best he's right up there,' said Garcia. 'Obviously I heard the roar on 16. I didn't know but I imagined it was an eagle. The only thing you can do is say ""well done"".' For Fowler is proved particularly galling. He was tearing up this course in near perfect conditions, going through the turn in 32  and then birdying 10, 11 and 12  to erase the six-shot advantage McIlroy had taken into the third round. But then came that crushing run of bogies and with it an emphatic McIlroy response. Fowler will nevertheless take encouragement from the fact that the six-shot lead McIlroy now has this afternoon can be closed, because he did it in 12 holes yesterday. He can also draw some comfort in knowing his two professional wins to date were both achieved with McIlroy as runner-up. His first victory, the Wells Fargo Championship two years ago, came after beating McIlroy on the first extra hole of a sudden-death play-off. Add to that the benefit of having been in much the same position in the US Open last month, not to  mention the confidence of having already finished in the top five in both majors this year, and Fowler goes into the final pairing today in decent shape. Feel the force: Rickie Fowler tees off on the 13th hole at Hoylake on Saturday . The advice he gets from Phil Mickleson, someone he referred to affectionately as his golf 'dad', is also sure to come in handy. What better mentor to have than last year's Open champion? 'I've learned a lot from Phil,' said Fowler. 'He's kind of been like, I hate to say it, but like a dad out here. It's been a lot of fun being around him. Not just playing on Tuesday, but having dinner with him and  seeing how he operates on and off the golf course.' Thanks to the work he has been doing this past year with Butch  Harmon – a coach Fowler described as the 'best in the world' – the young American has been  itting his irons superbly and at times he putted beautifully too,  sinking one from around 30 feet on the second hole. Garcia's approach on the eighth was also worthy of mention, even if he will want to  forget the two-and-a-half foot putt he missed on 12. Garcia thinks it a tall order, catching McIlroy. 'If he shoots three under, I have to shoot 10,' he said with a smile. 'So if Rory plays the way he's been playing it's difficult to see anybody catching him. When Rory plays well every course suits him. There's not really a lot of weaknesses in his game.' In the swing: American Rickie Fowler has been hitting his irons superbly . Fowler knows that too, having grown up competing against  McIlroy. They are just a few months apart in age – now both 25 – and are actually good friends as well as neighbours in Jupiter, Florida. They also have a penchant for brightly covered clothing even if McIlroy joked this week that  Fowler's fashion sense – he will once again wear the orange of Olklahoma State University today – was highly questionable. 'We've travelled a bit together between tournaments,' said Fowler. 'We first played against each other at the Walker Cup in 2007 and it's kind of gone from there. So I'm  looking forward to it tomorrow. It's going to be a good time. We're good buddies and at the same time we both want to beat up on each other as bad as possible. 'If I can go out and put a bit of pressure on him and make him earn it a bit, get myself in the mix, maybe we'll be able to throw some blows back and forth. 'The US Open last month was my first time in the final group at a major. But it was just a matter of time before the two of us found a way to sneak into a final group together.'","American draws inspiration from fellow countryman in Open bid .

"An Ebola outbreak that began in Guinea four months ago has turned into a cross-border African crisis that could spread to more countries, the World Health Organisation warned last night. Despite efforts by health authorities and aid groups to contain its spread, the WHO has recorded 635 infections, including 399 deaths, in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia since the outbreak started. The crisis is already the deadliest outbreak since Ebola first emerged in central Africa in 1976, and the number of infections continues to rise. The WHO is calling for drastic action to halt the epidemic. Scroll down for video .

Mr Sambo said: ‘There is an urgent need to intensify response efforts; to promote cross-border collaboration and information sharing of suspected cases and contacts... and to mobilise all sectors of the community. 'This is the only way that the outbreak will be effectively addressed.’ Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said this week that a lack of understanding has meant people continue to prepare corpses and attend funerals of victims, leaving them vulnerable to a disease transmitted by touching victims or via bodily fluids. MSF accused civil society groups, governments and religious authorities of failing to acknowledge the scale of the epidemic, resulting in few prominent figures promoting the fight against the disease.","World Health Organisation: 635 infections and 399 deaths since outbreak .

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:20 EST, 14 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:14 EST, 14 November 2013 . Residents of several Florida homes have been evacuated due to a sinkhole that opened up in a Dunedin, Florida backyard, near St Petersburg Thursday. Dunedin Deputy Fire Chief Trip Barrs said the hole appeared to be about 12-feet wide when officials arrived on the scene around 6am, but grew to 40-feet-wide and 30-feet-deep by 9am. Residents of seven neighboring houses were evacuated as a precaution and power has been shut off in the area. No injuries have been reported. Scroll down for video . Into the earth: A sinkhole opened up this morning in Dunedin, Florida, swallowing up parts of two homes . Expanding: When fire and rescue responders arrived on the scene around 6am, the sinkhole was 12-feet-wide but soon grew to 40-feet-wide and 30-feet-deep . Breakfast: The sinkhole gobbled up a boat, pool and one home's master bedroom. No one was injured from the sinkhole . Homeowner Michael Dupre said they heard the sinkhole open up in their backyard around 5:15 this morning. 'It sounded like banging against the windows. I thought someone was trying to break-in,' his daughter Ivy Dupre told Fox 13. Ivy Dupre said that there seemed to be two sinkholes, one that opened up in the backyard and one near her bedroom, but that has not yet been confirmed by fire and rescue officials. The sinkhole has swallowed up the master bedroom and in-ground pool of one home, while another home lost their deck and boat. After the sinkhole opened up, the Dupre's called 911. Fire and rescue officials told them to grab whatever they could and get out of the home. Sinkhole alley: Sinkholes are common in this area of Florida, nicknamed 'sinkhole alley' for the type of porous rocks that cause the earth to shift . 'We grabbed only the important stuff. Insurance information - stuff like that,' Mr Dupre said. 'You don't really think about this kind of stuff happening.' Sinkholes are common in Florida because the peninsula is made up of porous carbonate rocks such as limestone that store and help move water underground. Over time, the rocks can dissolve from an acid created from oxygen in water, creating a void under the limestone roof. When dirt, clay or sand gets too heavy for the limestone roof, it can collapse, creating a sinkhole. On February 28, Jeffrey Bush died when a sinkhole opened under his bedroom in Seffner, Florida, near Tampa. His body was never recovered. In August, sections of a building at a resort near Orlando collapsed into a sinkhole. No one was injured in that sinkhole. Early morning surprise: According to homeowners in the area, the sinkhole opened up at about 5:15 this morning . 'After the Seffner sinkhole, we were scared,' Mr Dupre told WTSP. 'We've been dealing with our insurance company and finally two days ago, they started working on our house. Now it looks like our house is gone.' State officials say three counties in the Tampa region are known as 'sinkhole alley.' Two-thirds of the sinkhole damage claims reported to the state Office of Insurance Regulation between 2006 and 2010 came from Hernando, Hillsborough and Pasco counties. Dunedin is in neighboring Pinellas County.","A sinkhole opened up at 5:15am this morning in Dunedin, Florida near St Petersburg .

"Jerusalem woke up on Tuesday to horrific images of slain Jewish worshipers, and scores injured in a terror attack on a synagogue. The assault which took place in the western Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof, shocked Israel to the core, as well as many others around the world. This is not surprising considering both the brutality of the attack and the fact it was carried out in a holy place, where innocent religious people were worshiping. The two assailants, cousins from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabal Mukaber, were shot dead by the Israeli security forces. The incident in addition to the ongoing violence since the beginning of summer, left the city of Jerusalem more divided than for a long time. The attack this week should have also sent a clear message to both leaderships that if they will not take measures to calm the situation down, further escalation and worse violence is around the corner. Regrettably, the Hamas praised the attack in Jerusalem and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the situation as the ""Battle for Jerusalem."" He also accused the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas of involvement despite the latter's condemnation of the killing. Both sides are employing inflammable language, although it is hard to blame the Palestinian president for feeling angry considering Israeli behavior since the collapse of the peace process in April. To make things worse, it emerged in recent days that Israel has also decided to return to a policy of demolishing houses of terrorists' families, even if they were killed during the attack. The Israeli security establishment argues that this form of punishment serves as a deterrence for any other would-be assailants. Regardless of the fate they face, their families are going to pay a heavy price and will be left homeless. In a society where three generations of one family might live under the same roof, one act harms quite a few people, from babies to the elderly.  To prove the seriousness of their intentions, the Israeli security forces already demolished a home on Wednesday. The home in Silwan was that of the Palestinian who drove his car into a crowd last month, killing two people. He was killed in the attack. The Army also moved to demolish the houses of the two who carried out the killing at the synagogue in Jerusalem. Ironically the policy of demolishing houses as a form of deterrence was abandoned back in 2005 at the request of the Israeli army.  A report produced, following an investigation by the Israeli security establishment, found this action counter-productive. There is actually evidence that house demolition led to a rise in the number of attacks. House demolition of Palestinian militants' houses is a form of collective punishment and an act of revenge, concealed behind a claim of deterrence. A similar ""standard"" was never applied to a Jewish terrorist. For instance when a  Jewish settler, Baruch Goldstein, slayed 29 Muslim worshipers in the Cave of Patriarchs, no one suggested to demolish his home as a deterrence. According to the Israeli human rights organization B'tselem, in the height of the Second Intifada, between 2001-2005, 664 Palestinian homes were demolished in the occupied Palestinian territories as an apparent deterrence. There is no evidence that the misery inflicted on thousands of innocent Palestinians enhanced Israeli security. It is worth remembering that the demolition of Palestinian houses in the West Bank also takes place for the purpose of expanding settlements, something which aggravates an already hostile population. Arbitrary house demolitions represent not only a bad policy, but are also illegal and immoral. This is a clear violation of international law, more specifically the Fourth Geneva Convention, clearly prohibits forcing individuals and groups out of their homes within an occupied territory. Any demolition of houses when there are no overwhelming military reasons is regarded as a grave breach of the Geneva Convention and could potentially lead to a war crime charge. And there is also, of course, a moral aspect. As deplorable as some of the acts committed by a few individuals, their punishment should not extend beyond their death or what the court decides. Their families, as a result, suffered a loss too, for no fault of their own. To condemn them to destitution for an act that they did not commit is a moral travesty. The decision by the Israelis to resume Palestinian house demolition following an attack on Jews in Israel is not a security decision but a political one, aimed to satisfy an angry public and extreme right-wing members of the current coalition. The Israeli coalition depends on satisfying their demands. However, the lack of credibility of the deterrence argument, combined with the immorality and illegality of house demolitions should serve as an overwhelming reason not to resume this abysmal practice.","Two Palestinians carried out a deadly attack on a Jerusalem synagogue this week .

"An Australian father who is believed to have been brainwashed by the preachings of Islamic extremist Musa Cerantonio has joined the ranks of terror group Islamic State to fight in the Middle East. According to Twitter, Zia Abdul Haq's current location is in an IS-controlled area of Ash-Shaam, also known as Syria. Friends of the 33-year-old believed the man from Logan - south of Brisbane - was moving to Syria to look for a new wife after the breakdown of his marriage, but The Courier Mail has revealed Abdul Haq is in fact fighting with the extremist organisation. Scroll down for video . The friends of Zia Abdul Haq says the father-of-one, from Logan, is a 'good-hearted guy' Two of Australia's most notorious jihadists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar are part of the same group. Abdul Haq is one of the latest of three men who are believed to have joined IS, including Melbourne's Abu Khaled al-Cambodi and Mounir Raad. The 33-year-old's friends described him as a 'good-hearted guy' but had been 'brainwashed' by Cerantonio - who is believed to be an influential IS figure - after hearing the radical sheik speak in Brisbane two years ago. The 33-year-old's friends claim he was brainwashed by prominent IS supporter, Musa Cerantonio - a radical sheik . 'He wasn’t a bad guy but he fell off the rails and under the spell of the extremists,' friend Yehya El-Kholed told The Courier Mail. 'Sheik Cerantonio is a hypocrite because while he urges people to go to Syria, he won’t go himself.' Since he landed in Syria, Abdul Haq - who came to Australia in his 20s and took up a job as a finance officer - has been actively posting photos depicting life as a fighter for IS on the social media site. These include M16 training, jihadists playing violent video games and cooking up a shared meal. But like Sharrouf and Elomar, Abdul Haq - who has a young son - has used Twitter as platform to fire off threatening messages, including one to foreign forces to 'bring dead body bag for each of your soldiers'. Most recently, he took aim at the U.S. saying 'Send you (men) to fight us, your drones are useless on the ground'  and 'How come you fight #IS with your gays & lesbians army' on Saturday night. Abdul Haq has also hit back at media outlets circulating news about him. 'Many lies about me in Australian news. =/,' he tweeted within half an hour of reports emerging. Since arriving in Syria Abdul Haq has been posting photos on Twitter of what it is like being an IS fighter . Last month Musa Cerantonio was deported back to Australia from the Philippines after he was arrested after breaching the Philippines' immigration laws. Changing his name from Robert Edward, the 29-year-old was detained in the central Filipino city of Cebu where he was believed to have been hiding from Australian authorities, despite claiming on Twitter he had arrived in the Middle East just days before his arrest. He was found with a Filipino fashion designer claiming to be his wife, inside an apartment. Australian authorities cancelled his passport, triggering his arrest and leaving without any documentation. He was then set free when he arrived in Melbourne after deportation as he had not broken any Australian laws. Musa Cerantonio is thought to be an influential IS figure and Abdul Haq is believed to have taken up extremist views after hearing the sheik speak in 2012 in Brisbane .","Zia Abdul Haq is believed to be fighting in Syria for the terror group .

"A mother whose premature twins died while she lay in a coma following a tragic ambulance mix-up has led the tributes among mourners at her daughters' funeral. Jocelyn Bennett, 27, attended the service for her children Melody and Rose Clarke at Lodge Hill Crematorium in Birmingham yesterday in a wheelchair. She was allowed out of hospital especially for the service, which comes after she spent 18 days in a coma only to be told upon regaining consciousness that her daughters had passed away. Scroll down for video . Jocelyn Bennett, 27, attended the service for her children Melody and Rose Clarke at Lodge Hill Crematorium in Birmingham in a wheelchair. She was supported by friends and family at the service for her twin daughters . The white horse-drawn princess carriage carried the coffins to the service at Lodge Hill Crematorium . Pink bunting was draped over the coffins of the twin daughters, with their names Melody and Rose on . The twin girls, Melody and Rose Clarke (pictured above in images released by the family), died from multi-organ failure on November 4 . Wearing her favourite colour red, she was wheeled behind the twins' tiny coffins as they were carried to the crematorium in a white horse-drawn princess carriage. White teddy bears were placed inside the carriage along with matching floral tributes. A card showing a picture of Ms Bennett and her partner Kevin, 31, cradling their tragic twins simply read: 'God Bless you Melody and Rose.' Reverend Denise Jones, who led the service, paid tribute to Melody and Rose saying they were two 'very very special baby girls'. She told the 50-strong congregation: 'They were much loved and wanted twin girls and baby sisters to little Slater. 'The last few weeks have been a journey of great courage, determination and faith. The loss of our children is the most painful thing to ever have to experience in our lives. 'Melody and Rose touched the hearts of all of us here today as well as the community and world and they have left behind a beautiful legacy of love.' Hymns 'All Things Bright and Beautiful' and 'Lord of the Dance' were sang by the congregation who all dressed in bright colours on the request of Ms Bennett. Mourners were played 'Somewhere over the rainbow' at the end of the 40-minute ceremony. The babies were delivered by emergency caesarean while Ms Bennett fought for life after collapsing at her home in Druids Heath, Birmingham. She was 32 weeks pregnant when she called 999 early in the morning of October 29 after suffering suffered a placental abruption. When paramedics arrived 12 minutes later at 5.51am, she was in such pain that she could not press the door buzzer to let them in.

Tragically, her neighbours refused to buzz the ambulance crew into the council-run tower block because they thought the blue flashing lights were from police vans about to raid the flats. When police finally arrived to let the paramedics in, they found Ms Bennett lying unconscious on the floor of flat - 30 minutes after her initial 999 call. She was rushed to hospital where 4lb 1oz Melody and 3lb Rose were born by emergency caesarean. Tragically, while Ms Bennett slipped into a coma, her baby daughters suffered multi-organ failure and their life support was switched off. They passed away on November 4. The devastated father of Ms Bennett, Joe, 54, said yesterday: 'This has been a tragic time for Jocelyn and everybody in the family. 'We are grateful for all the support and glad Jocelyn was able to attend the service. 'There are still questions which need answering as to why the paramedics were unable to get to Jocelyn sooner but today is about saying goodbye to Rose and Melody.' Following their deaths, Mr Bennett wrote a poem for each of the girls. He previously told how neighbours in the block of flats refused to answer their buzzers to police following a recent raid. 'If any residents see flashing blue lights they don't answer their calls because they fear it'll be another raid. 'No one answered their buzzers when the paramedics tried them. 'There are vulnerable people living in that building and the council has a duty of care for them. A better system needs to be in place.' Birmingham City Council is investigating why paramedics were unable to gain access to Ms Bennett's home in Pleck House. A spokesman for Birmingham City Council said: 'We have systems to provide emergency access to our blocks for the emergency services and an urgent investigation was commissioned as soon as we were made aware of the matter.' Tributes placed with the coffins from relatives of Ms Bennett offered condolences and love to the family . Rose and Melody were born prematurely and died aged just a few days old due to severe organ failure . The twins' tiny coffins arrived by a horse-drawn princess carriage before floral tributes were placed outside . Prior to their deaths, the Bennett family held a 'Christmas' party for the twin girls and had them christened. Ms Bennett's father, his wife Lorraine, and the girls' father Mr Clarke held a small party in hospital for the twins. Mr Bennett said they documented the party, in which they dressed up in Christmas hats and jumpers, so that they could show Ms Bennett photographs when she awoke from her coma. She came round on November 16. At the time of the party, Mr Bennett said: 'It was all for Joyce for when she comes round. We can show her the children were loved and that they brought love into our lives. 'I don't want her to see sad pictures. They were baptised on the day they were born as we knew that was what Joyce had wanted.' After the party, Mr Bennett and his wife dressed the babies in the clothes their mother had chosen to take them home in. On the day they passed away, the hospital chaplain performed a touching service before the babies were placed in their father's arms for one last cuddle. Mr Bennett and his family held the babies and celebrated an early Christmas with them before their deaths .

"A community stalwart with an MBE has been spared jail after claiming more than £23,000 of taxpayers' money by lying about his savings. Former magistrate Rahmat Ali Raja, 75, dishonestly claimed pension credits and council tax reductions for 10 years - despite, at one point, having more than £102,000 across nine bank accounts. But the retired charity director, who was also a local councillor in Pendle, Lancashire, was yesterday spared jail for his crimes. Guilty: Rahmat Ali Raja, 75, was yesterday spared jail for falsely claiming more than £23,000 in benefits. The former magistrate and local councillor was awarded an MBE in 2005 . Speaking after the hearing, Raja, originally from Gujarat, Pakistan, said: 'I am very sorry. I made a mistake.' Raja, who has already paid the amounts . back in full, was handed a 24-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months. He pleaded guilty to two counts of dishonestly failing to . disclose information to make a gain for self, and one count of . dishonestly making a false statement to obtain a benefit. Preston Magistrates' Court heard that, between October 2003 and September 2013, Raja told the Department for Work and Pensions he was retired and had just £5,601 in savings. He wrongly claimed £11,379 in the process. Dishonest: The retired charity director received pension credits and council tax reductions for 10 years . Raja also failed to declare his real savings to Pendle Council in November 2004, allowing him to wrongly claim £11,898 between October 2003 and March 2013. John Abbott, prosecuting, told the court how Raja would receive the payments into his Halifax bank account via automatic credit transfer. He said: 'Evidence has now become available that he had £83,000 on October 6, 2003 which was not disclosed at the time. Had the true facts been known, there would have been an effect on his benefits.' In 2009, Raja claimed he only had one bank account, which he shared with his wife. But Mr Abbott said: 'He had nine other accounts in his and his wife’s names and agrees they were there when he made the original claims for pension credit. He denied acting dishonestly and said he made a mistake.' John Wishart, defending, said: 'First of all, the guidelines make it clear that a large sum of money can be accumulated over a long period of time, as in this case. 'Of considerable mitigation is that the money was instantly repaid in full. The final payment was made in September last year.' He added that the ‘highest recorded amount’ in Raja’s savings at any one time was ‘a little over £102,000’. He added that although these accounts were in his name, they were shared by many members of Raja’s family. Sparing Raja jail, chairman of the bench Kathleen Strickland said his offences had been aggravated because he 'committed the fraud from the outset’. But she said Raja’s age, early guilty plea, full repayment and ill health prevented her from handing out an immediate custodial sentence. As well as his suspended jail sentence, which could be activated it he re-offends within 12 months, Raja must pay court costs of £85 and a £75 victim surcharge. Mrs Strickland said: “If you break this condition it could be very serious for you.” Spared jail: Raja, the former director of a community development trust, was handed a 24-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, at Preston Magistrates' Court . Raja was chosen to receive an MBE through his work as a former director of the Ithaad Community Development Trust in Nelson, which provided help and advice to those who needed it. Speaking after the case, he said: “I am very sorry. I made a mistake. All along I have said it’s my family’s money and my children’s money. “I filled out the forms but I did them wrong. My memory is not good and I am sorry.”","Rahmat Ali Raja, 75, dishonestly claimed benefits for 10 years .

"(CNN) -- Congress has moved to prevent money from the proposed $825 billion stimulus package from being used for zoos, aquariums, golf courses, swimming pools and casinos, an effort to ensure the bill funds only what it calls the ""highest quality"" infrastructure projects. Restrictions added to the stimulus proposal would keep the money from zoo projects, among other things. ""The purpose of this bill is to direct funding at projects that are primarily and clearly aimed at benefiting the economic conditions of communities and the public at large,"" the bill states. ""The federal government and all other levels of government are directed to look with a skeptical eye at projects that don't meet that test."" CNN revealed last month that a list of ""ready to go"" stimulus projects endorsed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors included museum and zoo renovations, aquatic centers, skateboard parks and bike and horse paths. One of the zoo projects in the report is a $4.8 million polar bear exhibit at the Providence, Rhode Island, zoo. The House Appropriations Committee added those restrictions last week after criticism from watchdog groups like the National Taxpayers Union, which monitors government spending. ""To the people supporting them, these proposals aren't a joke,"" said Pete Sepp, the group's vice president. ""But to the taxpayers funding them, yes this will be a joke for them, only they won't be laughing."" The restrictions in the bill appear meant to address reports about some of the projects endorsed by the U.S. mayors, Sepp said. The stimulus bill, known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, has been placed on the congressional fast-track. It could come to a vote in the full House of Representatives as soon as Wednesday, and Democratic leaders have said they aim to get the package to President Obama's desk for enactment by Presidents Day.  Watch Obama say he's optimistic after discussing the bill with GOP leaders » . ""A historical level of transparency, oversight and accountability will help guarantee taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and Americans can see results for their investment,"" Rep. Dave Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who leads the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement. The committee also added language that would prevent any money given to the state of Illinois from being handled by the state's impeached governor, Rod Blagojevich. Blagojevich faces federal charges accusing him of attempting to trade or sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Obama after his November election, and the state Senate began his trial Monday. The governor denies any wrongdoing and has skipped his impeachment trial to proclaim his innocence on the talk-show circuit. The measure sets up project monitoring, including a government-wide recovery program Web site, where all announcements for grant competitions, formula grant allocations and competitive grant awards must be listed. In addition, government agencies must publish on the site, ""a description of all infrastructure projects, and the total cost and the justification for using stimulus money."" The strict rules require that the notification include ""the name of a person to contact at the entity if there are concerns with the investment and an e-mail address for the federal official in each agency whom the public can contact,"" the bill states. ""Also included within the notification must be a certification from the mayor or governor or other chief executive, as appropriate, that the investment has received the full review and vetting required by law and that they accept responsibility that this investment is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars."" A Recovery Act Accountability and Transparency Board will be created ""to review management of recovery dollars and provide early earning of problems,"" according to a summary of the bill provided by the appropriations committee. The board will include inspectors general and deputy cabinet secretaries. The stimulus package is already being taken up by key committees in the Senate, where Majority Leader Harry Reid -- from casino-heavy Nevada -- said he is not concerned about the House restrictions on money going to casinos. ""Casinos are a huge part of Nevada's economy and create a lot of jobs,"" Reid told CNN on Tuesday. ""But none of the spending in this bill is earmarked for any casino, so this provision is largely symbolic.""","House panel adds restrictions to stimulus bill after criticism from watchdog groups .

"(CNN) -- He was loved and admired the world over, profiled in books and movies, and showered with awards and accolades. But even the most public of personalities have little-known facts buried in their biographies. Here are 10 surprising facts you probably didn't know about Nelson Mandela: . 1. He lived up to his name: Mandela's birth name was Rolihlahla. In his Xhosa tribe, the name means pulling the branch of a tree or troublemaker. (The name ""Nelson"" was given to him by his teacher on his first day of elementary school. It's not clear why she chose that particular name. It was the 1920s, and African children were given English names so colonial masters could pronounce them easily). 2. He had a cameo in a Spike Lee film: He had a big part in Spike Lee's 1992 biopic ""Malcolm X."" At the very end of the movie, he plays a teacher reciting Malcolm X's famous speech to a room full of Soweto school kids. But the pacifist Mandela wouldn't say ""by any means necessary."" So Lee cut back to footage of Malcolm X to close out the film. 3. There's a woodpecker named after him: From Cape Town to California, streets named after Mandela abound. But he's also been the subject of some rather unusual tributes. Last year, scientists named a prehistoric woodpecker after him: Australopicus nelsonmandelai. In 1973, the physics institute at Leeds University named a nuclear particle the 'Mandela particle.' 4. He married a first lady: Before tying the knot with Mandela on his 80th birthday, Graca Machel was married to Mozambique President Samora Machel. Her marriage to Mandela after her husband's death means she has been the first lady of two nations. 5. He was a master of disguise: When Mandela was eluding authorities during his fight against apartheid, he disguised himself in various ways, including as a chauffeur. The press nicknamed him ""the Black Pimpernel"" because of his police evasion tactics. ""I became a creature of the night. I would keep to my hideout during the day, and would emerge to do my work when it became dark,"" he says in his biography, ""Long Walk to Freedom."" 6. A bloody sport intrigued him: Besides politics, Mandela's other passion was boxing. ""I did not like the violence of boxing. I was more interested in the science of it - how you move your body to protect yourself, how you use a plan to attack and retreat, and how you pace yourself through a fight,"" he says in his biography. 7. His favorite dish is probably not yours: He's been wined and dined by world leaders. But what Mandela loved eating most was tripe. Yup, the stomach lining of farm animals. 8. He quit his day job: He studied law at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and opened the nation's first black law firm in the city in 1952. 9. He was on the U.S. terror watch list: Mandela wasn't removed from the U.S. terror watch list until 2008 -- at age 89. He and other members of the African National Congress were placed on it because of their militant fight against apartheid. 10. He drew his inspiration from a poem: While he was in prison, Mandela would read William Ernest Henley's ""Invictus"" to fellow prisoners. The poem, about never giving up, resonated with Mandela for its lines ""I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul."" You may know it from the movie by the same name starring Morgan Freeman as Mandela.","He had a cameo in a Spike Lee film .

"When Jose Mourinho answered a question about the new £5billion television contract on Wednesday evening, spontaneous applause broke out in the room from a group of Chelsea fans listening in. ‘When I was living in Italy and Spain I was paying about £200 a month to have the Premier League at my house,’ he said. ‘I think the Premier League is better when I am here.’ He really believes that stuff and so do his legions of supporters. Jose Mourinho and his Chelsea backroom team celebrate the late winner against Everton on Wednesday . Mourinho embraces Branislav Ivanovic after Chelsea's Premier League victory at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho speaks to the media at the post-match press conference on Wednesday night . Sportsmail's team of reporters discuss whether Jose Mourinho's off-the-field antics are starting to harm his and the Premier League's reputations. Click HERE to read. With that razor-sharp quip he walked out, heading back towards the manager’s office at Stamford Bridge to discuss with members of his backroom team the mayhem that occurred on the pitch in the 88th minute. On Thursday night, when the FA announced that Branislav Ivanovic had escaped punishment for throttling Everton substitute James McCarthy and then laying his forehead on him, it was regarded by the club as a major victory. They ignored the rationale, the television pictures that clearly showed referee Jonathan Moss on the scene when Ivanovic grabbed McCarthy round the neck after Gareth Barry had nobbled Willian. The TV images showing Ivanovic’s head make contact with McCarthy’s left ear were inconclusive, according to a panel of three former referees. Because of that, Ivanovic has got off scot-free. This literally is a fight for the title, with Chelsea happy to antagonise the FA, the opposition, officials, TV companies and the rest of the media with this increasingly odd behaviour. Mourinho has everybody on the run and on Thursday it was the turn of the FA to produce a series of statistics in an attempt to disprove his theory that a campaign has been started to destabilise Chelsea. Since 2005, Arsenal, Manchester City and Newcastle United have been charged six times by the FA for incidents that were not seen by the match official. Manchester United, Stoke City and Chelsea have been charged four times. The idea that there is a vendetta is a myth.

Ivanovic also clashes with Everton's John Stones in the closing stages of the Premier League match . Diego Costa (right) celebrates wildly after the final whistle is blown at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho (left) and assistant coach Steve Holland get animated against Everton on Wednesday night . Still, given Mourinho’s consistent claims about the injustices in the game, it would certainly help if the FA publicly clarified the position surrounding off-the-ball incidents. Confusion reigns. When he was questioned about Gary Cahill’s off-the-ball kick in the back of Harry Kane at White Hart Lane on New Year’s Day, Mourinho responded with a query about Raheem Sterling’s escape for raising his hands to Swansea defender Federico Fernandez. On Tuesday, Mourinho highlighted the FA’s failure to take any action against an unnamed player (Robin van Persie) for the glance at James Tomkins before the Manchester United man elbowed him at Upton Park on Sunday. From time to time, the Chelsea manager tosses in Arsene Wenger’s shove on him at Stamford Bridge on October 5, for which the Arsenal manager went unpunished. The memory plays tricks sometimes and Mourinho’s acolytes have forgotten how miserable life was in the weeks and months before he was sacked by Roman Abramovich in 2007 after drawing 1-1 with Rosenborg. We are close to revisiting that era, returning to a period when English football had earned a rest from the Chelsea manager. Mourinho (right) and Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger during a match at Stamford Bridge last October . Mourinho (left) celebrates wildly after Chelsea beat Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium last year . Seven years on they brought him back and just over a year into his five-year deal, nothing has changed. It is a sad day when the normally mild-mannered Chelsea assistant manager Steve Holland is seen haranguing the fourth official, as he did repeatedly on Wednesday. With coaching assistant Rui Faria, who fell to his knees and then grasped colleague Silvino Louro in a bearhug after Willian’s dramatic 89th-minute winner, it is to be expected. Now Holland is at it as well. In recent weeks, Chelsea’s technical area has become like the Dog & Duck at chucking out time. Someone needs to call time on it. What happened to winning with dignity or showing a bit of class? What a shame because Chelsea have a brilliant team, seven points clear of Manchester City in the Barclays Premier League and hurtling towards the title. At this rate it is in danger of being tainted.

Why should English football accept this yobbish, boorish behaviour on the touchline from one of the world’s super coaches and his increasingly aggressive assistants? With the exception of Abramovich, there is no one on the Chelsea staff who is prepared to tell Mourinho to fall into line. There is no question who runs the show there. Not only that, he is being allowed to run rings around English football.","The FA announced on Thursday that Branislav Ivanovic escaped punishment after grabbing James McCarthy around the neck .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to India travel, the state of Punjab, which borders Pakistan, doesn't make it to the top of that many itineraries. That's good news for intrepid travelers. From temples so gold they'll make your eyes water, to food you'll be longing for days after it hits your lips, Punjab is India at its colorful, lively best. 1. Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) Located in Amritsar, the holiest shrine of the Sikh religion, Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple), is Punjab's top attraction. Reflections of its gold-encrusted dome shimmer in the clear water of the Amrit Sarovar (Pool of Nectar), which greets those who enter from the north gate, the most impressive of all four entries. To take it all in, it's best to simply walk around the marble pathway surrounding the pool. Its waters are said to have healing powers. Devotional music, bathing pilgrims, golden carps and meditating devotees add to the atmosphere. Worth keeping in mind: There's a long line to visit the inner sanctum (Darbar Sahib), where the holy book of the Sikhs, ""Guru Granth Sahib,"" is kept. Visits are best scheduled for the late afternoon and early evening; every night the temple complex is illuminated. Simply stunning. You can end the day at the temple's langar (canteen). The scale of its free meal, put on daily by volunteers, is impressive, with 50,000 meals served each day, according to temple officials. The Golden Temple, Golden Temple Road, Amritsar, Punjab; +91 183 255 3957; open daily, 6 a.m.-2 a.m. 2. Punjabi eats . The city of Amritsar has a rich culinary heritage. Building a big enough appetite to give it the attention it deserves is a challenge. From melt-in-mouth chicken tikka to cream-laden, extra-large tumblers of yogurt lassi, Amritsar is an Indian food lover's dream destination. The best way to get a balanced taste is to start in Kesar Da Dhaba. Hidden in the twisting lanes of the old part of the city, it's reached only by foot, cycle rickshaw or bicycle. Founded in 1916, the restaurant is particularly popular with vegetarians. There's crispy butter-smeared tandoori bread; the house specialty, daal makhani, comes with a thick layer of ghee. At Makhan Fish and Chicken Corner, fried singhara (catfish) fillets are a must-try. They're coated in chickpea flour and caraway seeds then cooked. Perfect with cold beer. The creamiest and freshest yogurt lassi in Amritsar is at Surjan Singh Milk Bhandar; the thick drink is a mini-meal in itself. Kesar da Dhaba, Chowk Passian; +91 183 255 2103 . Makhan Fish & Chicken Corner; 21A, Majitha Road, near Maddan Hospital; +91 98 1519 3241 . Surjan Singh Milk Bhandar, Chowk Regent Cinema, GT Road . 3. Border face off . One of Punjab's most interesting rituals is the lowering of the flags ceremony, held at India's Wagah border each evening before sunset. Wagah is about 25 kilometers from the Pakistani city of Lahore. Indian guards in red and gold turbans march out to meet their Pakistani counterparts in a choreographed affair greeted with loud applause from onlookers. It's a splendid show of patriotism, pomp and panache. To secure good seats, it's best to get there by midafternoon or arrange for a VIP pass from the Border Security Force station. For security reasons, bags and backpacks aren't allowed. The border is 30 kilometers from Amritsar and takes about 45 minutes to reach by car. 4. Punjabiyat Lodge . Punjabiyat Lodge doesn't conjure quintessential images of India. Instead what you get here are feather-light beds with unobstructed views of green fields as far as the eye can see. The nature retreat in Punjab's agricultural heartland is a great place to de-stress through simple rural experiences. Visitors can lend a helping hand to farmers, cycle around the village, milk cattle or take a tractor ride. Rooms are luxurious but eco-friendly. Guests get a sense of remoteness and privacy; there are only four cottages, all set in a wheat field. Meals are a pleasure. Breakfast is served near the fields, lunch under the shade of sprawling trees and dinner on a terrace under a canopy of stars. Most meals are made with ingredients grown on the lodge's farm, says Punjabiyat manager Jagdeep Singh. Punjabiyat Lodge is in the village of Saidowal-Gunopur, about 75 kilometers from Amritsar; +91 981 870 5508 . 5. Sarai Amanat Khan . A scenic 45-minute drive from Amritsar, Sarai Amanat Khan is an old, crumbling caravanserai (roadside inn). Built by Mughals in 1640, it's a fantastic remnant of ancient architecture. It once served travelers on the Agra-to-Lahore trade route and was a prosperous pit stop back in the day. These days, the historic ruins only hint at its glorious past. Photogenic features of the complex include an arched entry, fading calligraphy, Persian tiles, eroding walls and a mosque. Amanat Khan, the inn's namesake, is believed to be the same guy who etched the calligraphy on the Taj Mahal in Agra. It's a great day trip from Amritsar. 6. Ranjit's Svaasa hotel . There are few better ways to end a wild day in Amritsar than climbing into one of the plush beds at the 200-year-old Ranjit's Svaasa hotel. Abhimanyu and his partner, Gayatri, are the gracious hosts of this charming, well-hidden retreat. The owners are seventh-generation members of the Punjabi Mehra clan, says general manager Deepak Biala. Corridors are dotted with family portraits, antique furniture and curios collected over their many travels. Secluded terraces and lounging spaces are spread throughout the property. The Rattan Chand and Dev Chand suites each come with a marble bathtub and a sitting area framed by large windows. Guest can learn to whip up a traditional Punjabi meal or hit the spa for an innovative wine-and-sugar scrub or face treatment with turmeric, sandalwood and organic rose water.

"(CNN) -- Three Delaware day care workers were arrested after police got hold of a ""disturbing"" and ""shocking"" cell phone video that, authorities say, shows two toddlers taking part in a fight the workers had organized. Police said Tuesday that they arrested Tiana Harris, 19; Estefania Myers, 21; and Lisa Parker, 47, who have been charged with assault, reckless endangerment, endangering the welfare of a child and conspiracy. On Saturday, authorities responded to an unrelated incident and a person whom police would not identify showed them video of the 3-year-old boys fighting in March. The toddlers were not seriously injured, but they were ""clearly hurting each other,"" said Dover Police Capt. Tim Stump. Authorities have not released the video but say one day care worker said ""No pinching, only punching"" after one of the boys complained that the other had pinched him. The video purportedly shows seven other children seated in the room with their backs to the fighting, according to police. ""It's not like they didn't know what was going on, and they were just encouraging them to continue,"" Stump said. ""One of the children attempted to run, but one of the teachers pushes him back into the fray. ""We are looking into the possibility that this was not the first time it happened, but it appears to be isolated, and it seems the administration was in the dark about this,"" he added. Police made the arrests Monday and addressed the incident that evening with parents and guardians of the children who attended the day care center. A spokesman for the state Division of Family Services said the agency dispatched an institutional abuse investigator to work with Dover police during their investigation. ""Depending on our findings, these women could be prohibited from working in the public sector, especially with children or senior citizens,"" agency spokesman Joseph Smack said, adding that all three women had passed background checks before their employment at the center. ""It's rare to see a case like this where the staff encouraged this type of behavior,"" Smack said. Calls to the day care center were not returned, though police say the company's business license has been suspended. The three suspects and their attorneys could not be immediately reached for comment. Police said the women have posted $10,000 bail and are awaiting trial. More from CNN Justice .

"By . Tamara Cohen . Fixed Odds Betting Terminals  allow users to spend up to £100 a go and are blamed for a  rise in gambling . Betting machines dubbed the ‘crack cocaine of gambling’ could spread to arcades and service stations as part of proposals from the amusement industry. Ministers are under pressure to allow the machines – which are currently only allowed in betting shops – to be more widespread. Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) are casino-style games which allow users to spend up to £100 a spin and are blamed for a worrying rise in problem gambling. They generate more than half of bookmakers’ profits. However they have been subject to greater restrictions since April, when new rules meant anyone wanting to spend over £50 must inform staff. Now BACTA, which represents the British amusement industry, is lobbying to be allowed to host the machines. In a letter to MPs and peers, the trade body says if the Government has not cracked down on the terminals, then they should be allowed in ‘any regulated adult-only gambling establishment’. It adds that it is ‘unfair’ to let betting shops reap all the benefits from the profitable machines. ‘The current situation... makes no sense and gives the bookmakers an unfair advantage,’ BACTA says. ‘If the Government deems [£50] a safe limit for bookmakers there is no reason that it is not safe for everybody.’ Campaigners say the amusement industry would have a strong case on competition grounds. There are around 33,000 FOBTs in the UK, but Adrian Parkinson, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said this move could add another 8,000. Ministers are under pressure to allow the machines – which are currently only allowed in betting shops – to be more widespread across the UK after BACTA started lobbying for them to feature in the amusement industry . ‘How can the Government say, ‘No’ when they are saying to bookies that it is OK to have them?’ he said. BACTA confirmed its position but did not wish to comment further. A spokesman from the Department for Culture Media and Sport said: ‘The rules around where FOBTs can be based are very clear and they will not be moving into other areas.’","Fixed Odds Betting Terminals allow users to spend up to £100 on each spin .

"By . Cindy Tran for Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . Members of feminist punk band Pussy Riot have compared Australia’s asylum seeker policy to the Russian prisoner conditions at Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas on Saturday night. Masha Alyokhina and Nadya Tolokonnikova opened their panel discussion at the Sydney Opera House, by addressing a proposal made by Australian activists that the pair boycott the festival, the Guardian reports. 'We were surprised by the problems here, such as detention camps, which are similar to what is happening in Russia,' Tolokonnikova told an audience in Sydney. Masha Alyokhina and Nadya Tolokonnikova opened their panel discussion at Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas . The pair met activists on Friday night to discuss the calls for them to boycott the festival over links between its co-organisers at the St James Ethics Centre and the federal government's asylum seeker strategy. Instead of refusing to attend, the pair said that speaking at the festival would hopefully draw attention to the topic. The members also called on Australia to withdraw its invitation to President Vladimir Putin to attend this year's G20 summit. Members of a feminist punk band Pussy Riot have compared Australia's asylum seeker policy to the Russian prisoner conditions . Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova were both sentenced to two years in jail after staging a protest performance in a Moscow cathedral in 2012 . 'We think that this person has no place at the G20,' Alyokhina said. When Prime Minister Tony Abbott addressed calls for Putin to be excluded from the G20 on Friday, he said it was weighing on his mind. 'It's not a decision which Australia really has a right to make unilaterally,' he told reporters. Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova were both sentenced to two years in jail and were released from prison in December 2013 after staging a protest performance in a Moscow cathedral in 2012. But the women said the situation in Russia was so repressive they would not be able to repeat their cathedral performance. Since their imprisonment, both women have campaigned to defend the rights of prisoners.

"Scathing: A report says Cliff Richard had his privacy violated during the police raid on his home . Sir Cliff Richard had his privacy violated after a secret deal between police and the BBC to film a raid on his house, a report says. The horrified pop star was left ‘unnecessarily distressed’ after learning police had swooped on his £3.5million home in Berkshire over a sex assault allegation dating from 1985 only when he saw it on TV while in Portugal. Images were beamed live around the world last August from a camera filming from a helicopter. Now a previously unpublished report says the deal between the BBC and the police should never have been done – suggesting Sir Cliff should not have been publicly humiliated in this way. It brands senior officials at South Yorkshire Police incompetent and calls the BBC dishonest for its explanation of how it came to know about the raid. After a BBC reporter approached the force, police chiefs allowed a reporting team including a camera crew to show officers searching the star’s home. The coverage caused a major row, and the findings by independent investigator and former chief constable Andy Trotter will reignite the controversy. Sir Cliff has not been arrested or charged. But many viewers said the BBC coverage made the 74-year-old singer look guilty. The damning report – released to the Daily Mail under the Freedom of Information Act – concludes: . Mr Trotter says: ‘People have seen a search of Sir Cliff Richard’s apartment unfold on television with details of a serious allegation put into the public domain prior to him being interviewed by the police. Scroll down for video . Coverage: BBC reporter David Sillito outside Sir Cliff's home. His colleague Dan Johnson (not pictured) was invited in for a meeting with senior figures at South Yorkshire Police . Consequence: The deal struck between the force and the BBC led to detailed coverage of the raid on the complex where Sir Cliff had a flat in Sunningdale, Berkshire (pictured), including a news helicopter . The search and the nature of the allegation... certainly interfered with his privacy and may well have caused unnecessary distress.’ He concludes that had the force refused to co-operate, the BBC would probably never have run the story. Although the BBC reporter, Dan Johnson, was not interviewed, Mr Trotter decided the corporation had not been fully open about how it came to hear about the allegation against Sir Cliff. The BBC claim – that Mr Johnson had persuaded South Yorkshire Police to agree the deal when all he knew was the name of the celebrity suspect – was ‘not one I believe to be credible’, Mr Trotter said. Evidence supported the police account that Mr Johnson had detailed knowledge and ‘knew as much’ as police did when he made contact. The BBC has never revealed the source of the original information. Up close: The footage of the raid showed several investigators entering and had images inside the house . News event: But Sir Cliff, who maintains his innocence, has not been arrested or charged over the claim . Sir Cliff has called the allegation that he sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in 1985 ‘completely false’. He was interviewed by police under caution and, more than six months on, inquiries are on-going. Mr Trotter was asked to investigate police handling of the raid by police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright. Analysis reveals the BBC journalist contacted the force’s communications director Carrie Goodwin on July 14 after an alleged leak from Operation Yewtree, the inquiry into abuse claims involving Jimmy Savile. A meeting was held the next day with Mr Johnson and Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick, who agreed to tell him the date and location of the raid in exchange for him holding the story until that day to protect the investigation. The chief constable was also informed of the agreement. Mr Trotter said Miss Goodwin should not have arranged the meeting with Mr Fenwick, not have confirmed any information about the inquiry to the BBC reporter and not have agreed to notify him of the search. Mr Fenwick should have refused to meet or disclose any details to the BBC. And Chief Constable David Crompton ‘could have rescinded the agreement’. A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘While we believe our actions in relation to dealing with the media were within policy and were well intended, they were ultimately flawed and we regret the additional anxiety which was caused to Sir Cliff Richard.’ The BBC was not directly involved in Mr Trotter’s review. A spokesman said: ‘The home affairs committee has already endorsed the way the BBC handled this story. We have nothing further to add.’ A spokesman for Sir Cliff said he would not comment.","Sir Cliff first saw raid on his £3.5m Berkshire home on TV last August .

"Driving tests should have a distinction grade to improve road safety, a Tory minister has said. Skills minister Matthew Hancock said it is wrong that would-be drivers can only pass or fail. He said that if there was a higher level to aspire to, insurance firms would be able to offer cheaper premiums to the best drivers – which could make the country’s roads safer. Test: Almost a quarter of the road accidents resulting in death or serious injury last year involved a driver under 24. That age group is roughly four times more likely to be involved in a serious accident (file picture) It comes after the Government said it was considering raising the driving age to 18 – from the current 17 – in a attempt to reduce the number of fatal accidents. Youths could be forced to wait until they are 19 before they qualify for a full licence, and all motorists under 30 could be banned from giving their friends a lift or driving at night for 12 months after they pass their test. Almost a quarter of the road accidents resulting in death or serious injury last year involved a driver under 24. That age group is roughly four times more likely to be involved in a serious accident. Mr Hancock, who is Conservative MP for West Suffolk, made his suggestion at a car factory in Oxford last week, at an event where apprentices met David Cameron. ‘One of the things that’s in the . implementation platform is that every apprenticeship in the future will . have a pass, fail or distinction,’ he said. Fifteen minors allowed: Currently, learner drivers are given some indication of how they fared by seeing their report card at the end of the test, on which their minor or major faults are marked (file picture) ‘I’m personally very committed to this. People say ... you can be a perfectly good bricklayer or you can be brilliant. Parents who park illegally when dropping off or picking up their children from school could soon find themselves caught on camera. The cameras, which are timed to switch on during the morning and afternoon school run, spot those who stop in restricted zones. The surveillance system records footage of the number plate and no-parking sign and sends it to councils, which can then use it  to issue fines of up to £120. Five councils in London and at least two others outside the capital are testing the system, which costs £16,000. Manufacturer Videalert refused to say which they were. Actor Tom Conti, 71, who drops his grandchild off at school in London, compared the camera system to surveillance by the Stasi. He said: ‘The councils are doing this for revenue. To target parents is frankly disgusting.’ ‘People say the driving test is just pass or fail. But actually if we had a distinction on the driving test, maybe those people could get lower premiums and be safer drivers.’ Currently, learner drivers are given some indication of how they fared by seeing their report card at the end of the test, on which their minor or major faults are marked. Up to 15 minors are allowed before they will be failed. Sources at the Department for Business and Skills said it was not official Government policy to have a distinction level, but that it was an idea Mr Hancock was in favour of. He is particularly close to Chancellor George Osborne, meaning his thoughts are discussed at the highest levels. Last night Edmund King, president of the AA, said the idea was ‘interesting’ and could help make roads safer. He said the distinction pass could be reserved for those who excelled in their tests and completed advanced lessons. ‘Young drivers are not ready for Britain’s roads after passing their tests,’ he said. ‘They are ten times more likely to have an accident in the first year after passing their test. ‘The idea of having a distinction is interesting. If a new driver has completed lessons on motorways and driving at night and excelled at their test they could get a lower insurance premium.’","Matthew Hancock says it's wrong would-be drivers can only pass or fail .

 Lindsay Lohan worked like crazy and completed 115 hours of community service in Brooklyn to meet her Thursday deadline and avoid jail, a source confirmed to the Daily News. 
  
 “She finished last night or today,” the well-placed source said Wednesday. 
  
 And while the prosecutor on her case contested a prior batch of hours served overseas in London, Santa Monica City Attorney Terry White said Wednesday that he plans to accept the new Brooklyn hours when they’re presented at a Los Angeles hearing Thursday morning. 
  
 “It does appear that Ms. Lohan has completed her community service hours, and at this point I am not anticipating any sort of challenge to the hours,” White told The News Wednesday.

 It was three weeks ago on May 7 that a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge said Lohan could race to Brooklyn from her new home in London and try to complete 115 hours of service with the charity group Brooklyn Community Services (BCS) by a May 28 deadline. 
  
 He warned that the deadline was firm, and jail was on the table.

 “She’s had three years to take care of this. If it’s not done by May 28, there will be consequences,” Judge Mark A. Young said.

 Lohan, 28, got off to a rocky start, missing her first day at BCS’s Duffield Children’s Center in Fort Greene on May 12. But she started the next morning and powered through back-to-back full-day shifts at the daycare center, a women’s shelter in East New York and possibly other BCS groups. 
  
 Her lawyer Shawn Holley is expected to appear on her behalf and submit the proof of service Thursday. 
  
 If the judge signs off, Lohan could wrap up her 2012 reckless driving case and be off probation for the first time since her conviction for back-to-back DUIs in 2007. 
  
 The “Mean Girls” actress originally was ordered to complete 240 hours of community service by last November to satisfy probation for her June 2012 car crash on the Pacific Coast Highway in Santa Monica. 
  
 She scored an extension when a judge agreed to give her more time as she acted in a London production of the David Mamet play “Speed the Plow"" late last year.

 Lohan later rushed to meet the extended deadline in January and thought she made the cut until prosecutors objected. 
  
 White questioned how Lohan was able to complete 10 hours on Jan. 19 considering she went to an emergency room that day for treatment of a mosquito-borne virus she purportedly picked up in Bora Bora. 
  
 “(A) note says she received acute care for three days, but on those three days, again, 10 hours were served,” he said with exasperation in late January. 
  
 “I’m having trouble not only with the quality of the work but whether or not the work was actually done,” he told the judge. 
  
 She agreed to serve 125 hours by May 28 to settle the dispute and had 115 to go as of her last hearing. 
  
 Lohan’s service with BCS appeared to go well with parents offering their support and the former child star keeping a low profile.

"A man who bit a dog during an altercation outside a corner shop later ran inside and died from a suspected heart attack after 'being restrained', it has emerged. The man, who is in his forties, bit the dog – believed to be a Staffordshire bull terrier – during a dispute with a 45-year-old man in Cambridge. He then ran into a nearby One Stop convenience shop, reportedly in his socks, and died a short time later, after allegedly being held by four men. The man, in his forties, bit the dog - believed to be a Staffordshire bull terrier - during a dispute with a 45-year-old man outside a One Stop shop (pictured) in Cambridge. He later died of a suspected heart attack inside . Police and paramedics were called to the store following the incident at about 6.30am on Monday, having received reports of a man in cardiac arrest. The man, who is believed to live in the area but has not yet been formally identified, was pronounced dead a short time later. A post mortem examination to determine his cause of death proved inconclusive, police said. Further tests will now be carried out at Peterborough City Hospital, including a toxicology test. Four men, aged 40, 44, 69, and 50, from  Cambridgeshire, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following his death. They have since been released on bail until February 11. A 45-year-old man, who was allegedly involved in the original dispute outside the shop, was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm but has since been released without charge. Police said no further action would be taken. Witnesses to the incident described seeing two men 'shouting and struggling' in the street, prior to the man's death. Samantha Lander, a resident on Dudley Road, told Cambridge News that she was awoken by the sound of shouting and looked out of the window to see a struggle, which appeared to involve a dog that looked like a Staffordshire bull terrier. It is believed the man who died had run off into the shop following the dispute and was being restrained by four men in the store when he became unwell. East of England Ambulance Service confirmed a rapid response car, ambulance and an air ambulance were sent to the scene after receiving reports of a man having a cardiac arrest. A spokesman said: 'We were called at 6.51am on Monday and were on scene in seven minutes. 'Unfortunately despite the best efforts of everyone involved a male patient sadly died at the scene.'

Cambridgeshire Constabulary said the man's death was being treated as 'unexplained' but confirmed it was not deemed to be suspicious. A spokesman said: 'The death of a man on December 15 in Cambridge is being treated as unexplained by police. 'The man, who is in his 40s and from Cambridge, died after police were called to an incident at a premises in Ditton Lane at just after 6.30am.

"They were taken on as volunteers and the service has since decided to employ an extra four full-time counsellors.
Documents seen by the BBC show its welfare and counselling team was almost halved between 2008 and June 2017.
The London Fire Brigade said the mental health of staff was a ""main priority"".
At least 80 people died in the fire in North Kensington on 14 June.
More than 200 firefighters attended the tower block at the time, rescuing 65 people.
The extra four full-time counsellors would effectively return staffing levels to those in 2008.
The BBC understands there was the equivalent of 9.6 full-time counsellors working for the brigade in 2008. By the time of the fire, the number had been cut to 5.2.
The London Fire Brigade is using its reserve budget to pay for the extra counsellors.
But London Mayor Sadiq Khan has written to the government asking for it to provide extra funding for the fire service's staffing, as well as aerial appliances and improved breathing apparatus.
The fire service did not confirm the extent of the support the 60 voluntary counsellors have given or if they are still being used.
Siobhan McGee, a trauma specialist and former London Fire Brigade counsellor, said while firefighters were generally ""very resilient people"" it was normal for symptoms of traumatic stress to occur following a tragedy such as the Grenfell fire.
""They may be experiencing things like physically shaking in their body, elevated heart-rate,"" she told Victoria Derbyshire.
""They might have disturbed sleep, they might have nightmares, they might have induced images and flashbacks.""
She said over time, as trauma memory is processed by the brain, images and memories become less distressing.
A spokesman for the London Fire Brigade said every firefighter who attended Grenfell was individually spoken to by a counsellor before they came off duty.
""When they returned to duty our staff also had access to a counsellor, and the brigade counselling team was reinforced by officer support from the NHS and other fire and rescue services,"" the spokesman said.
""Going forward, counsellors are visiting staff this week and carrying out a psychological health check of each individual and identifying further staff who might need support.
""We have an on-call counsellor available to all staff 24/7. The ongoing mental wellbeing of all of our staff continues to be a main priority.""
The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.","An extra 60 counsellors were drafted in by the London Fire Brigade to help firefighters traumatised by the Grenfell Tower fire, the Victoria Derbyshire programme has learned."

 He drives five to six more hours until he reaches the new address in the sand and waits for the next text, containing another set of coordinates. The process is repeated a minimum of three times before the jihadists finally show themselves.

(A spokesman for Areva denied in an email that a ransom had been paid.)

They forced the tourists to drive with a gunman riding on the back of the seat.

By one recent al-Qaeda estimate, ransoms covered half of its expenses.

"(CNN) -- The World Cup's focus on attacking football has won global praise but a cloud scurried across the tournament Tuesday as match fixing claims surrounding Cameroon's participation in the event emerged. The Cameroon Football Association (Fecafoot) has confirmed it's investigating allegations made in the German media that seven of its players were involved in match fixing during the group stages of the World Cup finals in Brazil. While previous investigations centered on trying to fix international friendlies or low-profile qualifiers, this is the first time since 1982 that World Cup group stage games have come under scrutiny. The ""Indomitable Lions"" were drawn in the same pool as Croatia, Mexico and host nation Brazil, losing all three games. A convicted match fixer spoke to German magazine Der Spiegel correctly predicting one of the results of the African nation. ""We wish to inform the general public that, though not yet contacted by FIFA in regards to this affair, our administration has already instructed its Ethics Committee, to further investigate these accusations,"" said a Fecafoot statement. Wilson Raj Perumal, who was detained by police in Finland earlier this year on an international arrest warrant, told Der Spiegel that Cameroon would lose to Croatia while also having a player sent off. CNN has not been able to independently verify the Der Spiegel report. Midfielder Alex Song was red carded during the game for lashing out at Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic, while goals from Ivica Olic, Ivan Perisic and a brace from Mandzukic without reply secured a 4-0 victory. The match also saw Cameroon players Benoit Assou-Ekotto and Benjamin Moukandjo aggressively confront each other, with television pictures appearing to show Assou-Ekotto attempting to head-butt Moukandjo. CNN contacted Song's agent although he was not immediately available for comment. The Fecafoot statement continued: ""Recent allegations of fraud around Cameroon 2014 FIFA World Cup three preliminary games, especially Cameroon vs. Croatia, as well of the 'existence of seven bad apples (in our national team)' do not reflect the values and principles promoted by our administration, in line with FIFA Code of Conduct and the ethics of our nation."" In the Der Spiegel interview, Perumal, who CNN is trying to contact, used the expression ""seven bad apples."" A FIFA spokesperson told reporters Tuesday that they could not comment on whether an investigation was underway on the manipulation of games. Fecafoot meanwhile added in its statement that ""in 55 years of existence, it has never been sanctioned for, involved in, or even linked to match fixing or any fraud of any kind."" The investigation marks an uncomfortable end to Cameroon's disastrous World Cup campaign. Players initially refused to board the plane to Brazil until a dispute with Fecafoot over bonus payments was resolved. Although an agreement was eventually reached, the team's departure was delayed by a day. An opening game 1-0 loss to Mexico was followed up by the 4-0 thrashing by Croatia. Hosts Brazil then completed the misery by defeating the four-time African Cup of Nations champion 4-1. In the aftermath of the Croatia defeat, coach Volker Finke described the behavior of some of his players as ""unacceptable."" ""Some players behaved very badly, and that's why we have conceded four goals,"" Finke said to L'Equipe. ""I know that it is difficult to play with 10 men, but that is not a reason to lose it to this point. ""The game was balanced until the red card. The Croatians were more clinical in front of goal, but Cameroon also had chances to score. ""The behavior of some of the players is really not satisfactory. Even when we were 11-a-side, it was not acceptable."" In 1982, Algeria, despite having beaten then West Germany, went out after a seemingly contrived 1-0 win over Austria.","Cameroon to investigate allegations of match fixing by its players at the World Cup .

The six-year-old, a three-time group one winner in 2013, has raced three times since returning to training this summer after encountering fertility problems at stud, winning the 10-furlong Group Three Winter Hill Stakes at Windsor before finishing fifth to The Grey Gatsby in the Irish Champion Stakes last time out. Charlton, whose dual Group Three winning miler Captain Cat tries to win his first Group Two prize in the Joel Stakes at Newmarket on Friday, said: ‘The step up in trip and step down in class is just Al Kazeem needs.’ Al Kazeem will run in the Cumberland Lodge Stakes at Ascot a week on Saturday . Roger Charlton believes the step up in trip and step down in class is just what Al Kazeem needs . The Cumberland Lodge Stakes was an option for Jeremy Noseda’s Grandeur but the gelding, who has run three times without luck across the Atlantic this summer, will again be on his travel with a shot at the $1million Canadian International at Woodbine on October 19. The five-year-old won the Listed Foundation Stakes at Goodwood for the second year running but Noseda will be have to look for a new jockey in Canada. Wednesday’s rider Ryan Moore should be needed for Sir Michael Stoute-trained Hillstar, a winner at Newbury on Saturday. Noseda’s Newmarket colleague Roger Varian may have just won his first Classic with Kingston Hill in the St Leger but there was one surprising omission from his CV. Until Andre Atzeni-ridden 15-8 favourite American Artist passed the post first in the British Stallions Stud Maiden Stakes, Varian had never had a winner at Goodwood from 50 runners in his four-year training career. Varian confirmed that Kingston Hill was on course for a crack at the Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on October 5, saying: ‘It is all systems go – I have been very pleased with his since the Leger.’ Roger Varians says Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes winner Cursory Glance might run again this season . Varian also refused to rule out the possibility that his Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes winner Cursory Glance might run again this season. Moore was also successful on his father Gary’s Good Luck Charm. That stretched his title race lead to five (142-137) over Richard Hughes, who also picked up a two-day whip ban on runner-up Shadow Rock.","Six-year-old has raced three times since encountering fertility problems .

Protest groups and 15 councils will seek to stop the Government’s controversial £34billion high speed HS2 rail project dead in its tracks when they challenge the ‘fundamentally flawed’ project in the High Court from Monday. Ahead of the legal battle they warned ministers: ’You may ignore our protests but you can’t ignore the courts.’ Teams of barristers led by QCs will present five separate legal challenges against the Department for Transport on environmental and financial grounds over a nine day period to prevent the ‘damning blight’ of homes and countryside close to the line. Money wasted: Protesters say the new HS2 project has been 'an abysmal business case and represents extremely poor value for hard pressed taxpayers' money' The judicial reviews are being launched by the umbrella group 51M representing 15 councils along the route, two challenges by the HS2 Action Alliance, as well as Heathrow Hub Ltd and Aylesbury Park Golf Club. The first phase of the scheme for the 225mph trains involves a 143 mile route from London to Birmingham by 2026, followed by a ‘Y’ shaped split to Leeds and Manchester in the North by 2033. Objections to be put to the High Court include Government failure to provide accurate information, failure to comply to environmental statute, failure to assess the impact on communities, failure to adequately assess alternatives, failure to consider the impact of HS2 on other parts of the transport infrastructure, and that the decision on compensation failed to meet Government promises and relied on ‘undisclosed information’. Proceedings start on Monday December 3 and is expected to conclude Tuesday December 11 with the councils first to fire their legal broadside . Transport mess: High Speed HS2 protest poster showing former Transport Secretary Justine Greening and current one Patrick McLoughlin portrayed as Laurel and Hardy . Councillor Martin Tett, Chairman of the 51m alliance and leader of Buckinghamshire County Council said: ‘We are doing this with immense reluctance; however we feel that we have been left with no alternative. ‘ . He said the project has ‘an abysmal business case and represents extremely poor value for hard pressed taxpayers' money’. ‘Far better alternatives exist to . build the infrastructure the country desperately needs more quickly and . at far lower cost. We cannot let the Department for Transport with its . atrocious record on managing key investment decisions not answer for why . these have been ignored.’ Councillor Sarah Hayward, Leader of . Camden Council, said: ‘The judicial review enables us to highlight the . impact of this fundamentally flawed scheme, through the legal system. ‘This scheme will bring a damning . blight to Camden that could last for decades, and the council will fight . for every home and business, brick by brick.’ Stop HS2 Campaign Coordinator Joe .

Penny Gaines, who chaise the Stop HS2 . campaign said: 'The Department for Transport have failed in their duty . to adequately assess the environmental impact of HS2.‘ . Hilary Wharf , Director, HS2 Action . Alliance said: ‘The Government is trying to force through HS2 without . following proper process.  Our cases concern environmental issues and . the consultation on compensation.’ ‘We are confident in our arguments.

'My partner has built a business in Essex over the last five years and we were hoping to move to be closer to his work. 'But as our house is 400 metres from the proposed line we are not entitled to any compensation and we are left with a big mortgage on a house that is effectively worthless.’ A Department for Transport spokesman  said: ’HS2 will bring cities closer together, drive regeneration, tackle overcrowding and stimulate economic growth. ‘While it would not be appropriate to comment on the specific claims, the Government is confident that the decisions on HS2 have been taken lawfully and fairly and it is vigorously defending these legal challenges.’ The Prime Minister this week gave a ‘personal undertaking’ to review compensation schemes for properties affected by the planned high speed 2 rail link after being challenged by his former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan. Ms Gillan, whose Chesham and Amersham seat will be home to part of the route, urged a generous package for those who live and work nearby.

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court tried mightily to wade through a cloud of bureaucratic regulations Monday over setting clear air standards, a high-stakes environmental and economic fight pitting the Obama administration against a coalition of states and utilities. The justices on Monday heard six separate appeals, which were consolidated into more than 100 minutes of often dense oral arguments. A ruling is expected by June. At issue is narrow, but potentially far-reaching -- whether the Environmental Protection Agency can tighten emissions standards for ""stationary"" greenhouse gas sources, such as power plants, in what the administration says is an effort to stem the effects of climate change and global warming. In the larger political sphere, this issue could be major test of executive authority, with many conservative groups painting President Barack Obama as misusing his power and ignoring the will of the legislature. Obama just last week announced new executive rules to extend carbon emission standards to larger trucks and buses. The White House said ongoing stalemates on Capitol Hill prompted the President to act. Republicans in Congress and their allies have expressed similar concerns over discretionary executive branch changes and delays in implementing the Obamacare health reform law, a tepid federal response to recent state marijuana legalization, and a refusal to defend a law that did not recognize legally-married same-sex couples for federal purposes. The high court last summer struck down that provision in the federal Defense of Marriage Act. The Supreme Court, in 2007, affirmed the conclusions by much of the scientific community that greenhouse gases-- including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions-- are an air pollutant, but that case dealt with emissions from motor vehicles. A range of business groups say the agency then improperly extended its regulatory authority to stationary sources. They worry the unchecked, expanded rules could someday apply to millions of other small carbon emitters -- schools, small businesses, and shopping malls. Defining ""air pollutant"" within the context of greenhouse gases -- and the ability of the EPA to exercise its rulemaking authority absent what it says was a clear congressional mandate -- took up much of the courtroom debate. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the half-dozen parties opposing the EPA cannot even agree on defining an ""air pollutant"" for regulatory purposes . ""That to me is the quintessential ambiguity in a statute where we give deference to the"" EPA, said Sotomayor. ""So if your side can't even come to one interpretation, why shouldn't we defer to the agency?"" But Justice Anthony Kennedy, who could prove the court's decisive fifth vote, bluntly addressed U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli. ""I have to say in reading the brief for the states and reading your brief, I couldn't find a single precedent that strongly supports your position,"" he said. Texas and 16 other the states in the South and Midwest were among the parties whose cases are under review by the high court. The justices had previously rejected three other related appeals, including one from Virginia -- broader challenges to the EPA's power over carbon emissions. A coalition of 15 states backs the White House. Some progressive groups worry the conservative majority Supreme Court has been overly friendly to corporate interests in recent years, and could rule in this case against the administration. But an outcome in this his case was not clear from the arguments. ""We have to think about it, along the parameter of separation of powers and whether the way in which the agency has perceived it here has arrogated an exceptional and troubling degree of discretion to design its own climate change program,"" Peter Keisler, the attorney representing the private groups bringing suit, told the court. Justice Elena Kagan, the most vocal backer of the administration, said the Clean Air Act was originally passed and amended before a clear understanding of the effect greenhouses gases were having on the planet. She said the EPA made a careful determination that they were different from pollution sources that cause breathing and other health problems, such as smog, and could apply different monitoring standards. ""What's happened here is that you have this new kind of emission that basically makes these two terms of the statute irreconcilable, and the agency has essentially picked one,"" said Kagan. ""It said: 'Look, we're not going to just exempt a broad class of pollutants. Instead, we're going to fudge the numbers.' And why isn't that the more reasonable of the two things to do?"" she asked. Verrilli made clear the stakes in his oral presentation, telling the court that greenhouse gas emissions are ""an urgent environmental"" issue. ""It's the gravest environmental problem that we face now as far as EPA's judgment, and it is one that gets worse with the passage of time,"" he said. But some justices questioned the agency's reach. ""Are greenhouse gases the only air pollutant for which EPA has the authority to change the statutory thresholds?"" asked Justice Samuel Alito. ""Could it do this for another pollutant, something other than any of the greenhouse gases?"" After Kennedy and Chief Justice John Roberts pressed the point, Verrilli suggested the EPA could broaden its discretionary authority, absent a specific congressional mandate. This is the second major environmental regulation case that will be heard this term. The justices in December heard arguments over the EPA's ability to measure emissions from an upwind state that is polluting a downwind state, requiring upwind states to pay for greenhouse gas reductions. A ruling in that case is still pending. Many business groups hope the conservative majority will limit the reach of government in this and a range of regulatory areas, which the Chamber of Commerce and others say is hurting the economy and stifling innovation. The cases argued Monday are Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. EPA (12-1272); Texas v. EPA (12-1269); Southeastern Legal Foundation v. EPA (12-1268); Energy-Intensive Manufacturers Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Regulation v. EPA (12-1254); American Chemistry Council v. EPA (12-1248); and Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (12-1146).","Supreme Court hears six appeals during oral arguments .

"By . Aap . Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has told an inquiry into the treatment of children in detention about the 'moral burden' and 'emotional challenges' of his job, but says indulging in sentiment will result in more asylum seeker deaths at sea. Mr Morrison made the comments during his opening statement into an Australian Human Rights Commission inquiry hearing into the treatment of children in detention. 'There is much emotion in this serious topic that is before your inquiry. There should be,' he told AHRC president Gillian Triggs in Canberra. Scroll down for video . Immigration minister Scott Morrison speaking during a public hearing of the Human Right Commission at Parliament House in Canberra today . 'As a parent of two young children, the emotional challenges of working in this policy portfolio are just as real and just as great [as] they would be any other parent in my position. 'But sentiment cannot be indulged at the expense of effective policy that is saving lives and ending the chaos and tragedy that was occurring.' He said the Australian people decided at the last election that enough children had drowned while seeking asylum. 'There is no decision that I, or any of my predecessors, take as a minister in this area that is free of moral burden.' A group of asylum seekers are transported to Christmas Island in July 2012 after their boat issued a distress signal . 150 children will be released from mainland detention centres into the community. But approximately 700 children will remain in detention on Christmas Island (pictured) and on Nauru . The inquiry comes as this week Mr Morrison announced that 150 children held in mainland detention centres would be released into the community on bridging visas by the end of the year. Approximately 700 children will remain in detention centres, including those in Nauru and on Christmas Island. Concerns have been raised by refugee advocacy groups about the effect mandatory detention has on children, with allegations of physical and sexual abuse and deprivation outlined in a recent report released by the Australian Human Rights Commission. However Mr Morrison said the inquiry should be investigating his Labor predecessors, under whose watch most of the children arrived in Australia. Mr Morrison expressed disappointment the commission had not sought testimony from his four Labor predecessors, given more than 8,469 children arrived in Australia by boat during the Labor years. 'I invite the commission to rectify this situation by extending an invitation to my predecessors,' he said. Under the Abbott government, more children had been released from detention than put in, he said. He said just 353 children had arrived in Australia by boat since the September election, while 537 were released from detention - with the further 150 to come out in coming months. A drawing done by a six-year-old asylum seeker currently detained in Australian . There have been allegations that the conditions of the detention centres could cause depression and trauma for the children . Prof Triggs pressed Mr Morrison for any evidence that detaining children for long periods of time had a deterrence effect. 'There appears to be no connection between these two,' she said. People she had interviewed in mainland centres and on Christmas Island had 'no idea' of that aspect of government's policy. But Mr Morrison said detention of young children was merely a consequence of the government's policy not to allow refugees to be processed in Australia. That was followed by a heated exchange about whether detention facilities employed armed guards and resembled prisons. Prof Triggs said there was no way into the centres except through armed guards. Immigration department secretary Martin Bowles took issue, categorically denying armed guards work at the centres and calling on Prof Triggs to retract her statement. The commissioner then claimed conditions on Christmas Island were similar to those of prisons, prompting Mr Morrison to query whether she was comparing the facility with Long Bay jail. Prof Triggs said she would like to move on. Mr Morrison blamed the government's lack of movement on processing tens of thousands of backlogged refugee applications on the Senate, which was refusing to pass the reintroduction of temporary visas. The government's policy was to no longer grant permanent visas to refugees meaning there was no visa available for them, he said. 'And the government is not going to allow a set of policies to be weakened that would see an Australian staring into the face of a child corpse again,' he said.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Hugh Hefner founded Playboy magazine 55 years ago and turned the adult-oriented publication into a multimillion-dollar empire. CNN anchor John Roberts recently sat down with Hefner, now 82, and talked about Steven Watts' new book, ""Mr. Playboy: Hugh Hefner and the American Dream."" Hugh Hefner, 82, says that ""staying young is what it is all about for me."" John Roberts, CNN anchor: Mr. Hefner, good to see you. Hugh Hefner: It is my pleasure. Roberts: You have over the decades certainly supported political causes, you've supported Democratic causes. I'm wondering what your thoughts are regarding the pending inauguration of Barack Obama and where you think the country is headed in the next four years. Hefner: Well, where the country is headed is obviously a question we would all like to know. But I, certainly, [say] this [is] a time for a change. I supported Obama. I'm delighted that I lived to see a black president. I think he's a very good man. I think we've had ... eight of the worst years in my memory. And we hope that Obama can make some difference.  Watch the interview with Hugh Hefner » . Roberts: You know in the 1950s and through the '60s and the early '70s you were such a factor in the sexual revolution in this country. With the election of Barack Obama, do you believe that the cultural revolution has come to an end? Hefner: It's always ongoing. You know, we remain essentially a puritan people. And so I think that conflict is always there. One got a remarkable revolutionary change in pop culture and in moral values in the '60s and '70s, and then there was a backlash. And that backlash, I think, has influenced government. And, um, the Christian right has had, played a major role in all of that. And I think that the complicated problems with religion being involved with politics hopefully will come to an end for a while at least. Roberts: Now in 1953, when you first launched Playboy magazine, you seemed to be the right publication for the right time. I know that you were very heavily influenced by the Kinsey Report, which had come out not too long prior to that. But 55 years later, is Playboy magazine still relevant? And if it is, how do you keep it relevant? Hefner: Well, I don't think obviously it will ever play the same kind of role that it played back in the 1950s and '60s. But I do think that a magazine of quality always has a place. Increasingly, obviously fewer people are reading magazines and fewer people are reading newspapers and books, but I think that part of that is a change that Playboy is always, is also embracing. We're very much involved with the Internet. We were the first magazine to use [the] Internet and have our own Web site. So I think that we'll continue to publish and publish both the magazine and then publish through electronics. Roberts: The new Steven Watts biography is a fascinating, very fascinating look at your entire career, from your roots all the way up until the present. And he says, looking back over it, that ""the key to his approach was that he edited Playboy for himself. Aiming it at his own tastes and values."" Was that also a key to your success as well that you approached this with such a personal passion? Hefner: I think so, but I think that is one of the things that makes magazines unique. They do speak with a personal voice. And I think it is one of the things that makes magazines special. Roberts: Now this, of course, has been a family enterprise. You founded the magazine, your daughter Christie took over as CEO of the company in 1982. She has been there for 26 years, but she's stepping down later on this month. Will you be able to still maintain that same - I don't want to say ""quality"" because I'm sure the quality was there -- but can the business continue in the fashion it has for the past 55 years? Hefner: Well, only time will tell. If you're talking in terms of family connections, I have two teenage sons. As a matter fact, there was an interview with Marston and Cooper in the current January issue. Roberts: I saw it. Hefner: Marston has just turned 18 and is at Trinity College. Cooper will be graduating in June and will be going to USC, and both have an interest in the magazine. Roberts: So you'll be able to continue that legacy into the future? Hefner: That is my hope. Roberts: Hugh, in the early part of the 1980s you ran into a number of problems. You were attacked on a number of different fronts by Reagan conservatives, the feminist movement, business started to suffer. Of course, there was the murder of 1980 Playmate of the Year Dorothy Stratten and charges that you had exploited her. A recent article in the Baltimore Sun described those times this way. It said: . ""Many now viewed Hefner as an anachronism: A creepy old guy padding around the mansion in slippers, pajamas and smoking jacket, pathetically cavorting with the same young bimbos and living the dissolute life of an aging Lothario -- the sexualized Peter Pan who refused to grow up."" How did you overcome all that and survive another 25 years in the way that you have? Hefner: Well, I think that's probably the great question. One of the big questions is ""Why is the brand so hugely popular again?"" There was a period in the '80s and '90s on which we were in the shade, and the brand has become hugely popular again. Part of it because of the television show. The television show is a global phenomenon. And what is unique about it is the fact that it is more popular with women than with men. Roberts: I know. The program you are talking about is girls gone wild ... sorry, ""Girls Next Door."" It's heading into its sixth season. And one of the statistics I saw is that 78 percent of the viewers are women. How do you think you've tapped into that market? Hefner: Well, we certainly didn't anticipate it. The original notion of doing the show through the eyes of the girlfriends seemed inspired because it took a lot of the pressure off of me. Because I'm a very busy guy. I still am very busy involved with the business and with the magazine. So the notion of doing a reality show through the eyes of the girls was a good idea because it took the pressure off the old man. What we didn't anticipate, of course, was as a result ... it is a hugely popular phenomenon with women and that, of course, is really welcome. Because we knew that we were going to have the guys so the fact that the magazine and the brand is now hot with young women bodes well for the future. Roberts: Of course, the three principals in ""Girls Next Door"" are Holly, Bridget and Kendra, and we know that there has been a bit of a change in the relationship between you and Holly, at the very least. Will they be back again next year for the next season? Hefner: Yes, all three of the girls are scheduled for season six. It will be a season of transitions and we will be meeting some of the new girls, too. Roberts: You're 82 years old now? Your latest girlfriends are a pair of 19-year-old twins, Karissa and Kristina Shannon. You are 63 years older than they are. A lot of people would say, ""How do you do it?"" And other people might say, ""Are you ever going to grow up?"" Hefner: Well, I'm never going to grow up. Staying young is what it is all about for me. Holding on to the boy and, um, long ago I decided that age really didn't matter and as long as the ladies ... feel the same way, that's fine with me. Roberts: Well, you're definitely the youngest 82-year-old I've ever seen. Hugh Hefner, thanks for being with us today. Hefner: My pleasure always. Roberts: Take care. Hefner: Thank you.","New book about publisher is ""Mr. Playboy: Hugh Hefner and the American Dream""

"Russia's economic development ministry estimates the economy will contract by 0.8% next year.
It had previously estimated the the economy would grow by 1.2% in 2015.
Russia's reliance on tax revenues from the oil industry makes it particularly sensitive to price movements.
Household disposable incomes are also forecast to decline by as much as 2.8%, compared with a previous estimate that they would grow by 0.4%.
The sharp revision in Russia's economic forecast is the first admission from the government that the economy will contract.
""The current prognosis is based on a drop in GDP by 0.8% in 2015, against the previous prognosis of growth by 1.2%,"" deputy prime minister Alexi Vedev said.
On Monday, the rouble suffered its biggest one-day fall since 1998.
The currency slid almost 9% against the dollar before rallying after suspected central bank intervention. The currency has already lost 40% in value this year.
The Russian finance ministry has also not ruled out spending more than 500 billion roubles from the budget's Reserve Fund next year.
The 2015-2017 budget allows for spending of up to 500bn roubles (Â£5.9bn) next year from the Reserve Fund, but Maxim Oreshkin, head of the finance ministry's long-term strategic planning department, said it was possible the government could spend more to support the economy.
He added that if the average oil price were $80 per barrel in 2015, the finance ministry's forecast for a fall in GDP was in line with the economy ministry's prediction of a 0.8% contraction.
He also said that a scenario in which the oil price averaged $60 a barrel in 2015 was pessimistic, and at that price, the Russian economy would contract as forecast in the central bank's ""stress scenario"".
The bank published its stress scenario last month, saying that at $60 per barrel, GDP would decline by 3.5% to 4%.
""The real damage from the collapsing rouble and oil price is to investment and growth,'' said Chris Weafer, senior partner at Moscow-based Macro-Advisory, in a note to investors.
""Russia is a non-investible country for all but the bravest of hedge fund investors right now, and will remain in this category until both the rouble and oil stabilise at minimum.""
The price of oil has fallen nearly 40% since the summer because of oversupply caused by rising US shale oil production.
Demand has also fallen, particularly in China, the world's second largest consumer of the commodity, where industrial production has slowed in recent months.
Last week, Opec ministers met to discuss a possible cut in oil production in order to stabilise the oil price, but the meeting broke up without agreement.
Opec secretary general Abdallah Salem el-Badri said: ""There's a price decline. That does not mean that we should really rush and do something.""
The fall in the oil price has been causing concern for several members of the oil cartel, as most require a price above $80 a barrel to balance their government budgets and many need prices to be above $100 a barrel.","The Russian government has warned the economy will fall into recession next year as Western sanctions, in response to its role in eastern Ukraine, and falling oil prices begin to bite."
"A rare megamouth shark washed up on a beach dead in the Philippines this week, wildlife officials have said. The 15-foot shark, a Megachasma pelagios (giant mouth of the deep), was discovered dead on the beach in Marigondon, Pio Duran, in Albay province. It is only the 60th megamouth shark seen in the world, according to marine biologist Christopher Bird. Scroll down for video . Fishermen use a stretcher with steels bars to carry a rare megamouth shark, which was found dead on a beach in the Phillipines . The Marine Wildlife Watch of the Philippines said the shark is being stored in an ice plant until a necropsy can be performed. The shark, nicknamed 'Toothless', was already dead when it washed ashore and the cause of death is unknown. It was carried inside by fishermen in a net and preserved in ice by local villagers. The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in Albay province will investigate to determine the cause of the shark's death. In July last year, an 18-foot megamouth was caught by Filipino fishermen. The 15-foot shark was discovered dead on the beach in Marigondon, Pio Duran, in Albay province . This megamouth shark is displayed after being discovered in Tokyo Bay near Ichihara City in 2004 . Most have been found in Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan, but the first confirmed megamouth shark sighting came in 1976, when a deep-sea anchor accidentally caught one near Hawaii. A megamouth shark can reach to a maximum length of 17 feet and have a life span of up to 100 years, according to Reuters. The species lives in deep waters but rises towards the surface at night to feed or eat plankton.

"Global warming is claimed to be already posing problems for polar bears, whose numbers are waning because of melting ice, dangerous conditions and fewer hunting opportunities. Now experts have warned that chemical pollutants may be reducing the density of the bears’ penis bones. This puts them at risk of breaking their penis, which could have disastrous consequences for mating and the survival of the endangered species. Not in rude health: Scientists have warned that chemical pollutants may be reducing the density of polar bears' penis bones. This puts the them at risk of breaking their penis, which could have disastrous consequences for mating and the survival of the endangered species (stock image) Mammals such as otters have a penis bone, or baculum, which is thought to be a by-product of evolution, although experts are not sure. Now, a team of scientists led by Christian Sonne at Aarhus University, Denmark, has found that a certain type of pollutant called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is associated with a less dense penile bone, New Scientist reported. They have previously shown bears that have high levels of pollutants named organohalogens, such as PCBs, in their bodies, have smaller than average penis bones and testes. Organohalogens contain at least one halogen such as fluorine or chlorine, and are used as solvents and pesticides, as well as in the making of dyes and drugs. PCBs were used to make paints and rubber goods in the 1930s, but were banned in 2001 after scientists discovered they can cause cancer. The connection: A team of scientists led by Christian Sonne at Aarhus University, Denmark, have found that a certain type of pollutant called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are associated with a less dense penile bone.

Uncertain future: Global warming is already posing problems for polar bears, whose numbers are waning thanks to melting ice, dangerous conditions and fewer hunting opportunities. A stock image is shown . Because they break down slowly, they can still be found in the Arctic, meaning that animals such as polar bears are especially at risk. Together with a team from Canada, Dr Sonne examined buculum specimens from 279 polar bears that were born in north-east Greenland and Canada between 1990 and 2000. They used X-rays to study the density of calcium in the bones and then compared their findings with regional pollutant data. Experts have previously shown that bears that have high levels of pollutants  in their bodies, have smaller than average penis bone. A collection of ancient bones is shown . The team discovered a connection between low bone density and high PCB levels, but stressed that their findings are not strong enough to prove that the pollutants are the cause of the problem. While experts are unsure of the exact purpose of the bacculum in polar bear mating, Dr Sonne thinks that a weaker bone could prove problematic, because if it breaks, it will likely stop a male from mating. While no extensive studies in the wild have been done to understand the effect pollutants on polar bear populations - because they are difficult and expensive - Dr Sonne thinks chemicals have probably killed a lot of bears in recent decades. He even believes PCBs, for example, may have cause changes to the bear’s genes. It’s already been found that thin bears have higher levels of pollutants in their bodies, so some experts fear that hungry bears may be more vulnerable to the effects of chemicals such as PCBs. In 2013, scientists uncovered a worrying trend in 'shrinking' penis bones in otters, possibly caused by chemicals. Experts at Cardiff University and the Chemicals, Health and Environment Monitoring (CHEM) Trust suggested a link between hormone disrupting chemicals and problems with male reproductive health. Experts studying the reproductive health of the mammals in England and Wales were concerned to find a decrease in the weight of otters' penis bones. Other health problems in males included an increase in undescended testicles and cysts on sperm-carrying tubes.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 450lbs white rapper from Antioch, Tennessee, is regretting borrowing his favorite restaurant’s logo for the cover of latest mixtape after Waffle House sent him a cease and desist letter for infringing their copyright. Jason DeFord aka Jelly Roll jokingly describes himself as ‘a regular fat piece of white trash’ and claims to have visited the food chain hundreds of times. Earlier this year, he recorded a 21-track mixtape which he called ‘Whiskey, Weed & Waffle House’, in tribute to three of his favorite things. Waffle House blues: Rapper Jelly Roll has been a loyal customer for years but that didn't stop the company suing him for copyright infringement . He printed up 10,000 copies to give away, with a front cover featuring a bottle of Crown Royal whiskey, a pot leaf and Waffle House’s distinct logo. The back-cover design even looked like the chain’s menu. Unfortunately Waffle House didn’t appreciate the homage and within a month 28-year-old Jelly Roll had received a cease and desist letter from their lawyers. The heavyweight rapper was ordered to destroy everything featuring the company’s name and logo within 10 days for infringing their corporate trademark. Lawyers for the food chain were quick to hit aspiring rapper Jelly Roll with a series of charges after he used their logo on his mixtape cover as a tribute to his favorite eatery . The company also filed a trademark claim that shut him out of his Facebook and YouTube accounts for more than a week. Initially flattered by all the attention from his favorite eatery, it took a visit to a lawyer for Jelly Roll to realize the severity of the situation. The thoughtless homage has left him picking up a very expensive check and he estimates that he’s lost more than $10,000 so far, including scrapping a video shot at a Nashville Waffle House and $500 every time his lawyer communicates with the chain. Yet despite being on the receiving end the company’s strong-arm tactics Jelly Roll confesses that he hasn't been able to stop eating at his local Waffle House. Jelly Roll called his mixtape 'Whiskey, Weed & Waffle House' in tribute to three of his favorite things . ‘I swore I wouldn't tell too many people - I promise you're the only reporter I’ll tell - I just ate at a Waffle House! Even after I vowed I'd never eat at one again, I found myself hungry at an odd hour, under the intoxication of a little whiskey and a little weed, and I wound up in a Waffle House,’ he confessed to Gawker. The incident has brought Jelly Roll a lot of undue stress, but he has gotten through tougher situation in his 28 years including going to prison for drugs possession. The father-of-one has even made able to make light of the situation. ‘I'm 450 pounds - I should have sued Waffle House 10 years ago! Do you know how many All-Star Breakfasts I bought in my life? I might’ve stopped at 330!’ he joked. Weighing in at 450 pounds, Rapper .

"Some 80 locals, described by police as far-right, brawled with 20 young asylum seekers in Bautzen.
The asylum seekers were chased to their hostel and put under police guard.
The mayor said the town had to avoid becoming a playground for the far right. A curfew has been imposed on the young asylum seekers.
Anti-migrant tensions have been mounting in Bautzen this year.
Locals cheered when a building due to house migrants was set on fire in February.
The following month, President Joachim Gauck was verbally abused when he visited Bautzen to discuss the influx of refugees in Germany.
Bautzen and the nearby town of Niedergurig are home to four asylum shelters.
Bautzen is 60km (38 miles) east of Dresden, where the ""anti-Islamisation"" Pegida movement began.
Since the arrival last year of 1.1 million irregular migrants and refugees in Germany, some areas, particularly eastern states, have seen a rise in anti-migrant violence as well as support for the anti-Islam AfD party.
Germany's federal police force says there have been 700 attacks on asylum accommodation this year, including 57 arson attacks.
Each fresh outbreak of refugee-related violence is potentially a political problem for Chancellor Angela Merkel. Some voters say large-scale migration could destabilise German society.
As a result the chancellor's conservative coalition has been haemorrhaging voters to the insurgent anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.  That's a particular worry given that this weekend voters in Berlin region go to the polls, and next year Mrs Merkel's national government faces re-election.
But many Germans from other parts of Germany are more likely to blame the clashes on racist sentiment, rather than see it as a product of the chancellor's welcoming stance on refugees.
That is because this beautiful area of ex-communist eastern Germany already has a rather ugly reputation for neo-Nazi support and right-wing extremist violence.
Wednesday's outbreak of violence in Bautzen was a dramatic escalation after days of tension in the town.
The clashes appeared to be triggered by an incident the previous evening, when a 32-year-old resident was hurt by a bottle being thrown.
On Wednesday night a group of some 80 people, described by police as right-wingers, shouted slogans at up to 20 young asylum seekers, accusing them of taking over the central Kornmarkt shopping centre.
Tensions escalated, fuelled by alcohol, and scuffles broke out.
Police said they tried to separate the groups and asked them to leave. Then the asylum seekers - all thought to have come to Germany as unaccompanied minors - hurled bottles and wooden sticks at the police, who responded with pepper spray and batons.
When they did disperse, they were pursued by the locals to a nearby asylum centre.
An ambulance crew was caught up in the clashes when far-right residents hurled stones at their vehicle as they tried to take an 18-year-old Moroccan asylum seeker to hospital for treatment.
""It wasn't anarchy, but there was at least a chaotic phase that I would say lasted between 45 and 90 minutes,"" said police chief Uwe Kilz.
Local mayor Alexander Ahrens said he would not tolerate the violence. ""It cannot be that Bautzen turns into a playground for right-wingers spoiling for a fight"".
The young asylum seekers will now face an alcohol ban and a 19:00 curfew.",Residents have clashed with asylum seekers in a town in eastern Germany that has become a flashpoint for anti-refugee sentiment.

"This figure could rise further as police continue their investigation, Assistant Chief Constable of Sussex Police Steve Barry added.
The vintage jet plummeted into traffic on the A27 on Saturday after attempting a loop manoeuvre.
Some victims of the accident have been named by their families.
The number of deaths was initially given as seven, but ACC Barry said it was now ""highly likely"" that 11 had died.
Victims who have been named by their families include Matt Jones, 24, and Worthing United FC footballer Matthew Grimstone, 23.
Another Worthing United footballer, Jacob Schilt, 23, is also believed to be among the victims, his club said.
In a statement, Worthing United FC said Mr Grimstone was their first team goalkeeper and was quiet and reserved, but with a ""huge talent and a brilliant player with huge potential"".
Mr Schilt was a ""tenacious midfielder, a skilful player, with an eye for goal"", the club said.
Sussex Police has said no-one on the airfield was injured but that the pilot - named locally as former RAF pilot Andy Hill - remained in a critical condition in hospital. He was pulled from the burning wreckage.
The status of the jet's ejector seats was yet to be determined, ACC Barry said.
He said the removal of victims' bodies was likely to continue throughout Monday. It was ""quite possible"" more victims would be discovered, he added.
ACC Barry said a crane would be brought in to lift the wreckage of the aircraft on Monday.
The large crash site remains a hazardous area, with fuel still on the plane.
In a video released by Sussex Police, ACC Barry later described the crash as ""devastating"".
He said: ""I've certainly not seen anything like this in my career in terms of the scale, the tragedy and the impact that this is going to have on the local community.
""We are entering the recovery phase of the operation and as we do that we are likely to uncover more fatalities but we are putting in a huge amount of effort in supporting the families and helping them to understand what has happened.""
He appealed to drivers to avoid the area, saying the A27, which was badly damaged during the crash, would be closed for at least another two days.
The crash happened at 13:20 BST on Saturday as the Hawker Hunter jet came out of a loop manoeuvre.
It then smashed into the A27, sending a fireball across the carriageway.
Neil McCarthy, a friend of pilot Andy Hill, told the BBC News Channel that the loop manoeuvre was regarded as ""one of the most dangerous"" to attempt.
He said that ""if you don't have the right entry speed, the right pull back on the stick, the G-force, the right gate height at the top of the loop manoeuvre, it can go wrong pretty quick"".
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch is also continuing to investigate the scene alongside the police, who have urged people to think twice before posting ""extremely graphic"" images of the crash online.","Eleven people are now thought to have died after a plane crashed into a West Sussex main road during an air show, police have said."

 Toxic chemicals are accumulating in marine creatures in Earth’s deepest oceanic trenches, the first measurements of organic pollutants in these regions have revealed. 
  
 “We often think deep-sea trenches are remote and pristine, untouched by humans,” says Alan Jamieson, a deep-ocean researcher at the University of Aberdeen, UK. But Jamieson and his colleagues have found man-made organic pollutants at high levels in shrimp-like crustaceans called amphipods that they collected from two deep-ocean trenches, he told a conference on deep-ocean exploration in Shanghai on 8 June. 
  
 “It’s really surprising to find pollutants so deep in the ocean at such high concentrations,” says Jeffrey Drazen, a marine ecologist at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu. 
  
 Before this work — which has not yet been published — the study of pollutants in deep-sea organisms had been limited to those that live at depths of 2,000 metres or less1, 2. The latest research tested for levels of organic chemicals in amphipods collected at 7,000–10,000 metres depth, from the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean — the world’s deepest trench — and from the Kermadec Trench near New Zealand. 
  
 The creatures were captured during two international expeditions in 2014, when researchers lowered uncrewed landers into the trenches as part of a research programme to study deep-ocean ecosystems, sponsored by the US National Science Foundation. 
  
 Polluted depths 
  
 In both trenches, the amphipods contained polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) — used to make plastics and as anti-fouling agents to stop barnacles growing on ships' hulls — and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are used as flame retardants. 
  
 Both chemicals are man-made and belong to a category of carbon-based compounds called persistent organic pollutants (POPs) because they are hard to break down. Production of PCBs — which are carcinogens — has been banned in many countries since the late 1970s; PBDEs, which animal studies suggest may disrupt hormone systems and interfere with neural development, are only now being phased out. 
  
 The concentrations of PCBs in the amphipods from the Mariana Trench were particularly high, and 15 times greater than those found in the Kermadec. “It’s even higher than in the estuaries of two of the most polluted rivers — the Pearl River and the Liao River — in China,” says Jamieson. 
  
 By contrast, the Kermadec Trench contains PBDEs at concentrations five times greater than the Mariana — and at a level that is higher than in the coastal waters of New Zealand’s North Island, the study finds. 
  
 Douglas Bartlett, a deep-sea microbiologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California, says that the discovery is fascinating. “It hits home very dramatically that the trenches are not that remote after all, and the world is all connected,” he says. 
  
 That sinking feeling 
  
 “The take-home message is that when you dump rubbish into the sea, it will ultimately sink. When [pollutants] fall into the trenches, they have nowhere else to go. So they’re just going to keep building up,” says Jamieson. Eventually, the trenches will have higher levels of pollutants than in estuaries, where chemicals are constantly flushed out to open waters, he says. 
  
 The researchers suspect that the proximity of the Mariana Trench to large plastic manufacturers in Asia, as well as to a long-term US military base on the island of Guam, may have contributed to its high PCB levels. The waters above the trench are also part of the North Pacific gyre, a system of strong swirling ocean currents that might be sucking materials on the surface down into the deep sea. Both the Mariana and Kermadec trenches are around 11 kilometres deep. “It sounds quite deep, but it’s not in terms of pollutant transport,” says Jamieson. 
  
 The high POP levels are a cause for concern, researchers say. The deep-ocean canyons are “untapped natural resources” — a potential supply of organisms that could be valuable for a range of commercial applications, including drug discovery, but which might be affected by the pollutants, says Drazen. 
  
 Scientists think that deep-ocean trenches could also be an important carbon sink, playing a key part in regulating climate, Bartlett says. In part, that is because in the trenches, carbon is pushed deep into Earth's interior when one tectonic plate is thrust underneath another. The trenches are also teeming with microbes that may convert carbon-containing chemicals into forms that aren’t easily converted into carbon dioxide. 
  
 “If somehow microbial activities are adversely affected because of all this pollution, I’d wonder what that’s doing to the carbon cycle in general,” says Bartlett. ||||| World Amphipoda Database 
  
 (part of WoRMS - the World Register of Marine Species) 
  
 Introduction 
  
 The amphipods belong to the very diverse crustacean class Malacostraca, which includes other common groups such as crabs, lobsters and shrimp. The order Amphipoda is part of the superorder Peracarida, uniting a diverse group of small shrimp-like taxa that brood their young in a pouch, with no independent larval dispersal stage. 
  
 Amphipods are unique in the possession of three pairs of pleopods and three pairs of uropods. In a small minority of cases secondary reduction of the abdomen may result in a loss of one or more pairs (e.g. the Caprellidae). No other malacostracan group possesses more than one pair of uropods. The name Amphipoda means ‘different feet’ and refers to the different forms of the pereopods (legs) which contrasts with the related Isopoda meaning ‘same feet’. Amphipods are variously known as, scuds, shrimp or sideswimmers. Those amphipods that have colonised the land are often referred to as landhoppers and beach dwellers are called sandhoppers or beach/sand fleas. 
  
 The order Amphipoda is very diverse and currently contains 10,207 species which are divided into six suborders: 
  
 Suborder Amphilochidea (88 families; 682 genera; 4,140 species) 
  
 Suborder Colomastigidea (2 families; 3 genera; 55 species) 
  
 Suborder Hyperiidea (35 families; 76 genera; 283 species) 
  
 Suborder Hyperiopsidea (3 families; 4 genera; 13 species) 
  
 Suborder Pseudingolfiellidea (1 families; 1 genera; 4 species) 
  
 Suborder Senticaudata (99 families; 907 genera; 5,638 species) 
  
 Amphipods range in size from a millimetre in length to the supergiant amphipod Alicella gigantea at 340 mm. Amphipods can be found in all marine habitats (even the deepest ocean trenches e.g. Hirondellea dubia), and have also colonised freshwaters and terrestrial habitats; even ectoparasitic groups are also known among them. There are at least 1870 amphipod species and subspecies recorded from fresh or inland waters accounting for ~ 20 % of the total known amphipod diversity. Amphipods are important herbivores, detritivores, micropredators and scavengers in most environments and they form an important component of marine and freshwater ecosystems. 
  
 History of the database 
  
 The World Amphipoda Database arose from a merger in 2010 of the World Amphipoda List compiled over many years by Jim Lowry (Australian Museum), with the European Register of Marine Species (ERMS) amphipod list, compiled by Mark Costello with the help of Denise Bellan-Santini and Jean-Claude Dauvin, and edited up until 2013 with significant additions from the RAMS Amphipoda (Antarctic) list (compiled by Claude De Broyer) and from other regional editors. 
  
 The original editors of Amphipoda within WoRMS were Mark Costello, Denise Bellan-Santini, Jean Claude-Dauvin, & Wim Vader, with Claude de Broyer as Editor of the Register of Antarctic Marine Species (RAMS) Amphipoda. The north-Atlantic lists were compiled by Mark Costello with assistance from Louise Collier, from Costello et al. (1989), Brattegard (1997) and Vader et al (1997). The Mediterranean and south Atlantic lists were compiled from Bellan-Santini et al. (1998), Marques and Bellan-Santini (1990, 1991), and Lopes et al. (1993). Additional species were then found in Dauvin (1999), and for Arctic seas, in Palerud and Vader (1991) and Vader (1998). Jim Lowry’s unpublished list was added to WoRMS in 2010 when he became editor of the Amphipoda. To provide sufficient expert knowledge for maintaining the database, we have now (2013) formed an editorial team to whom the queries on particular taxa should be addressed.

A research team out of Scotland's University of Aberdeen has discovered high concentrations of human-created organic pollutants in crustaceans gathered from two deep-ocean trenches, putting to rest any hope that people haven't managed to muck up even the world's most far-flung locations. ""We often think deep-sea trenches are remote and pristine, untouched by humans,"" lead researcher Alan Jamieson tells Nature, which notes he delivered his announcement about the find at a deep-sea exploration conference in China on June 8 and that the research has yet to be published. The work involved scientists lowering two unpeopled landers about 6 miles deep in 2014: one into the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean, and the other into the Kermadec Trench near New Zealand. They then tested the amphipods—tiny crustaceans that resemble shrimp—they found down there and discovered the creatures had polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), both hard-to-break down, carbon-based compounds used to make plastics and as flame retardants. The PCB concentration in Mariana Trench amphipods was especially stunning—15 times that of the crustaceans in the Kermadec. Researchers believe the high PCB levels may be due to the Mariana Trench's relative closeness to Asian plastic manufacturers. ""The take-home message is that when you dump rubbish into the sea, it will ultimately sink,"" Jameieson says. ""When [pollutants] fall into the trenches, they have nowhere else to go. So they’re just going to keep building up."" (Plastic is also floating around the ocean via human feces.)"
"Mr Muslem was a recent graduate in English literature; Shireen was still studying.
But four months after their wedding, their lives were shattered when so-called Islamic State (IS) fighters overran their city, forcing almost all of its civilians to flee into Turkey.
Now the couple and their 20-month old son Mirwan live more than 2,300 miles (3,700km) away in Colwyn Bay, Conwy county.
After more than two years in a refugee camp in northern Iraq, they are relieved to finally have a safe, long-term home.
""When IS attacked in 2014, everything was destroyed,"" Mr Muslem, 29, said.
""Everyone left. We moved to Turkey and then to Iraq but some people returned to the city. Then IS attacked another time and we lost abut 500 people. They were all killed.
""Every family in Syria has lost one person in the family. I lost my brother two years ago and we don't know if he is alive or dead. Some people have lost all their family.""
""It was so hard,"" Mrs Muslem, 28, added. ""We had to leave our town because of the war and all the destruction. We were afraid for our lives and we had to go. It was a bad situation.""
""Here, I feel very happy and settled, the people are very kind and when we need anything, they help us.""
Until the family arrived in north Wales, Mirwan had lived all his young life in the Gawilan refugee camp in northern Iraq.
""I delivered him in the camp,"" Mrs Muslem said. ""It was difficult because the weather is very hot and it was summer when I had him. I was afraid I'd lose him.
""There is only a small medical surgery at the camp and most of the time there is no medicine and the service is very simple.""
""I saw many, many bad situations when we first left Syria,"" Mr Muslem said. ""We didn't want to live in a tent but where would we go? There was no choice for us.
""We couldn't go to rent a house in another city so we stayed in the camp and lived in a tent.""
Since Kurdish forces drove IS out of Kobane in June 2015, some people have returned to the city - among them, relatives of the couple.
""I have two sisters in Syria,"" Mrs Muslem said. ""They moved back after the fighting ended. I worry about them so much and want them to come and live in the UK too but it's very difficult.""
Mr Muslem has two sisters in the refugee camp and family in Kobane.
""Their life is OK now but it's temporary,"" he said. ""Maybe war will come again, we don't know what's going to happen in Syria.""
By the end of February 2017, at least 397 refugees had been resettled in Wales under the UK government's Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme.
Mr and Mrs Muslem and Mirvan are the first to be placed in Conwy.
""I didn't know where I was going,"" Mr Muslem said. ""I was just told in Iraq, you will go to Manchester airport and you will live in Conwy.
""When we arrived, we saw it was a good town. The weather is good and it's very nice for tourism. There are nice places like Llandudno and Rhyl and Bangor - I've visited all of these cities.""
Life was lonely at first but after three months, the family is starting to make new friends.
""When I arrived here, I didn't know anyone,"" Mr Muslem said. ""I had one friend but the council helped me meet people.
""I know some more people now - I hope to meet many more but I know I have some friends.
""For me it's not difficult but for other people it could be because they don't know the language and if they can't speak the language, they can't meet people.""
He is perfecting his English at a college course in Bangor and wants to qualify as a teacher.
""If I go back to Syria after five years, I will help my own people in the university or in high school,"" he said.
For now though, the family is staying put in Wales to rebuild the burgeoning life that was wrecked nearly three years ago by war.","In the spring of 2014, newlyweds Omer and Shireen Muslem were starting a new life together in their hometown of Kobane, northern Syria."
"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen's armed forces have a new look after President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi ordered major changes to both the military's leadership and structure on Wednesday. The expansive reshuffle appears to have removed those loyal to Yemen's previous President Ali Abdullah Saleh from their powerful positions within the military, with several other generals attaining appointments to new positions. As part of the restructuring, the elite republican guard and the first armored division will be absorbed into the country's Defense Ministry. The republican guard has been led by Saleh's eldest son, Ahmed Ali Saleh, and Gen. Ali Mohsen Al-Ahmar, who defected during the 2011 Yemeni uprising, has commanded the first armored division. ""General Ahmed Ali and Ali Mohsen are a headache for millions of Yemenis dreaming of a better country and a real national military,"" Farea Al-Muslimi, a Yemeni youth activist, told CNN. ""It's a good step, but it should have been done a long time ago ... It won't happen overnight,"" added Al-Muslimi. ""It will need a few years for this to work out."" Amnesty details 'horrific abuses' in southern Yemen . ""Yemen will head in the right direction with this restructuring of the armed forces and the ending of the contentious divisions in the military,"" said a Yemeni government official who was not authorized to speak to the media. Yemen's military will now consist of five branches: Land Forces, Air Forces, Navy and Coastal Defense Forces, Border Guard, and the Strategic Reserve Forces, according to a news release from the Yemeni embassy in Washington. The Land Forces command will oversee seven regional commands, and the Strategic Reserve Forces will include the recently established presidential protective brigades, the new missile defense command and the new special operations command, the release said. A top presidential aide told CNN that the restructuring needed to take place quickly if Yemen was to go forward. ""We are working towards a unified army under a unified leadership, and this needs to take place now,"" the presidential aide said, asking to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue. The changes came as protests continued in front of Hadi's residence. Demonstrators said they wouldn't participate in the upcoming National Dialogue Conference unless Saleh's relatives and loyalists who hold key military and security posts are removed. Yemeni officials have been hoping all the political factions in the country would meet at the conference. President of Yemen visits White House . Youth activists celebrated in Change Square on Wednesday, calling the latest decrees a clear victory for reformists and those seeking democracy. ""We support these decisive military decisions, and a major part of our demands have finally been accepted,"" said Khaled al-Anesi, a leading activist among the first to publicly call for restructuring the military. ""After the removal of Saleh aides, we will seek justice for those who were killed by the previous regime,"" he added. Hadi took power in February as part of a Gulf Cooperation Council-backed deal that forced Saleh to trade his position for immunity after a year of political unrest destabilized the country. A United Nations envoy remains in Yemen to help with the transition.

"Three astronauts successfully reached the International Space Station this morning, where their six-month mission will include taking the Olympic torch on its first spacewalk. The arrival of American Michael Hopkins and Russians Oleg Kotov and Sergei Ryazansky after a six-hour journey returns the station to its full, six-member live-aboard crew.

Before that passing milestone however, Hopkins, Kotov and Ryazanskiy face more immediate problems. The skeleton crew they are reinforcing was to have overseen the arrival of a commercial cargo ship carrying vital food supplies to the station this week. But a software problem left the unmanned Cygnus freighter unable to receive navigation data properly from the station, delaying the arrival of its 1,300lbs of food and clothes until no earlier than Saturday.

The Cygnus cargo . ship, built and launched by Orbital Sciences with backing from NASA, . blasted off aboard an Antares rocket on September 18 from a new launch . pad on the Virginia coast. Orbital . Sciences said the two orbiting vessels established direct contact early . on Sunday, but the Cygnus rejected some of the data, which interrupted . the entire rendezvous. The problem was traced to a difference in data format in the navigation systems of the two spacecraft, the company said.

Hopkins, pictured left before the launch, told his mother after arriving at the space station that the journey there 'was a pretty good ride'. Left, the intrepid trio wave as they climb the steps into the Soyuz module . Despite the restocking problems, new arrival Hopkins was upbeat about his mission. During a prelaunch press conference on Tuesday he said: 'As a crew we're very excited to be up there when Cygnus rendezvous and docks and (we're) looking forward to opening that hatch.' He and Ryazanskiy are space rookies making their first flights. Kotov, who will take over command of the station when his compatriot Yurchikhin leaves in November, has made two previous long-duration missions on the station. During their five-month stay, Kotov and Ryazanskiy are scheduled to make three spacewalks, the first of which will include taking the unlit Olympic torch outside the airlock. 'Our goal here is to make it look spectacular,' Kotov, speaking through a translator, told reporters. Kotov added: 'We'd like to showcase our Olympic torch in space. We will try to do it in a beautiful manner. Millions of people will see it live on TV and they will see the station and see how we work.' The torch is scheduled to be delivered to the station on Nov. 6 by the next crew launching to the outpost. Yurchikhin, Nyberg and Parmitano will then bring it back to Earth when they return home four days later so the traditional torch relay can continue. 'Unfortunately we cannot light it in space so we will simply take it to space and take pictures and some video with the station and the Earth in the background,' Ryazanskiy said in a prelaunch NASA interview.

Radiant but visibly tired, the astronauts were yawning as they were talking to their families. They had been up for about 20 hours. Hopkins' mother described the launch as a 'heart-stopping experience.' 'It was a pretty good ride, mom.

"A couple that had been married for 69 years will now get the chance to spend eternity together. Giuseppe and Livia Fortuna of Stamford, Connecticut had a fairy tale romance, falling in love in Rome and getting married shortly before the end World War II, later having four children. They moved to Stamford in the 60s and, tragically, 91-year-old Giuseppe passed away on Saturday. So in love: Giuseppe and Livia Fortuna, who met in Rome and were married for 69 years . Eternal love: After Giuseppe passed away on Saturday, Livia died less than an hour later . Something shocking happened shortly after however, when his bride of 69 years, Livia, passed away less than an hour later. They had both been living together at the Smith House Health Care Center. It was from a 'broken heart' her family members told the San Francisco Chronicle. 'My mother was in shock to hear that my father had just died. She couldn't breathe and she was having a fit, even though she was on oxygen,' said Giuliana DiGeronimo, the couple's daughter. 'At the nursing home, everyone said they were angels. Everybody used to say how much they loved each other and how my father was always trying to help my mother.' The couple's other daughter, Angela Munzenmaier, was actually on the phone with her mother when her father died, and had to deliver the horrible news. Li9felong love: Family members say Livia died of a 'broken heart' 'I told her she needed to be strong and that my dad had passed away. She started screaming his name and didn't want to talk and hung up the phone,' Munzenmaier said. Soon after, her brother got the call that their mother too had passed. 'They yelled and screamed at each other almost every day, but I think it was because they liked making up so much,' Munzenmaier said. 'My mom was feisty.

"They say that pets become more and more like their owners as time goes by. So it should come as no surprise then that, like his master, Larry the Downing Street cat is himself fond of a little ‘chillaxing’ now and then. And on a day when Britain basked in the hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures reaching a sizzling 27c (81f), who could blame him. Taking it easy: Larry the Downing Street had more of a reputation for chillaxing outside on the pavement than catching mice - until now . Stretched out in the Midday sun the brown and white tabby slumped down on his side and took a well-deserved cat nap just a few feet from the door of Number 10. Larry, a rescue cat from Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, was given the title of Chief Mouser to the Cabinet and was chosen by Downing Street staff to tackle a growing rat problem last year. But since his arrival he appears to lack the killer instinct and instead of boasting an impressive kill ratio Larry has become better known for his...sleeping. He may not have to worry about the eurozone crisis or hauling Britain out of recession, but that didn't stop Larry seemingly neglecting his rat catching duties when he soaked up the sun yesterday. Is David Cameron too 'chillaxed' to run the country? Is David Cameron too 'chillaxed' to run the country? Now share your opinion . David Cameron attracted some criticism for his own 'chillaxing' last week following claims in a biography that he spends weekends at Chequers singing karaoke, playing tennis against a machine dubbed ‘The Clegger’ and downing several glasses of wine with lunch. His latest afternoon snooze came as Britain baked. After the wettest April on record and perhaps the coldest start to May in 70 years the mercury is finally beginning to move in the right direction. Sunseekers poured onto the country’s beaches whilst others headed into the garden for a spot of sunbathing. Creature comforts: Larry, pictured last year, appears to enjoy a cat nap as much as any other feline . Those at the Chelsea Flower Show were left wilting whilst one man and his dinghy floated out to sea in South Devon sparking a major rescue operation. Incredibly Britain was hotter than parts of Australia, South America, Africa and the Middle East. It also left most of the Mediterranean in the shade. And the temperature is expected to rise even further today (thurs). Forecasters said it could reach up to 28c (xxf) in the south and south east - and best of all, the glorious sunshine and blue skies are here to stay for at least a fortnight. Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers said: ‘It is bikini and ice cream weather for almost the whole country. Distracted: The preoccupied Prime Minister attracted criticism for his supposed 'chillaxing' style when pictured watching the end of the Champions League final . Running talks: Earlier in this week's G8 summit talks at Camp David, Mr Cameron and President Obama staged a 35-minute 'treadmill summit' side by side at the gym . ‘Pretty much everywhere has temperatures in the 20s Celsius and wall-to-wall sunshine. ‘In recent weeks we had low pressure over or close to the UK, bringing rain and cold temperatures. ‘Over the last couple of days, that has given way to high pressure, sunny weather and rising temperatures from the Continent.’ At 26.9c (80.4f) yesterday (wed) was the hottest day of the year, but it is expected to get even hotter today (thurs). It will be 28c and sunny in London. Summer sun: Larry's sunbathing session came as the rest of the UK enjoyed a gloriously hot May, including here in Aviemore, Scotland, where temperatures reached 26.9C . Basking: Rhianna Mallia, 18, and Louise Dougherty, 21, were just two of the many people who enjoyed the sun in Aviemore, which posted the hottest temperatures of the year in the UK yesterday . Bizarrely, the highest temperature was not recorded in the south but in the Scottish ski resort of Aviemore. It also hit 26.9c (80.4f) at London’s Heathrow Airport, 25.9c (78.6f) on Bournemouth’s beaches and 25.6c (78.1f) in London’s St James’s Park. Supermarkets reported a surge in sales of sausages, burgers and summer tipple Pimms as well as picnic treats such as pork pies. Five million sausages - 70 per cent more than normal - are expected to fly off supermarket shelves over the weekend as the country makes the most of the mini heatwave. Not the only one: Larry the cat was one of many who decided to kick back yesterday, including angler Arthur Cansfield in the Lake District . Asda also predicts it will sell one million burgers, half a million bags of salad - 20 per cent more than in a normal week - as well as a 115 per cent increase in burger bun sales. Chris Carden, Asda’s head of fresh food supply, said: ‘We have already seen rising sales throughout the week of typical BBQ fare such as burgers and sausages but with the mini heatwave expected to continue into the weekend, we’re expecting it to be one of the biggest we’ve ever seen for barbecue foods.’ Only days ago the country endured temperatures up to 4c colder than the average for this time of year. Ironically, the sweltering weather comes amid a relaxation of the hosepipe ban which was imposed by seven water companies on April 5 after months of drought only for it to rain almost non-stop for the rest of the month. Meanwhile, the arrival of the sun saw betting firm Ladbrokes slash the odds of the temperature soaring past 39c (103f) during the Jubilee weekend from 20/1 to just 8/1. Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: ‘It finally looks like summer has arrived, and the odds suggest the Jubilee weekend could be a scorcher.’","Downing St pet shows same knack for down time as his 'chillaxing' master .

Wozniacki, who won the tournament two years ago, showed glimpses of quality, but failed to deal with the forceful nature of Kvitova's attack. ""She just went for every shot and hit it deep, and I came under pressure straightaway,"" Wozniacki added. ""I thought I served well, though. In the second set I think I had my chances, and I probably should have taken them but I didn't. ""You never know what could have happened in the third set but there was still a long way to go. At the end of the day, she played a very good match out there. ""Petra's a player that when she's on fire, she's on fire and she wins a lot of matches."" Vinci and Errani to meet in Dubai . Meanwhile, World No.7 Errani defeated her doubles partner Robert Vinci 6-3 6-3 following an hour and 23 minute battle. ""It's tough to play against one person who knows what you're going to do with every shot,"" she told the WTA website. Errani will go into the final as favorite having won each of her three previous meetings against Kvitova without dropping a set. But Kvitova believes she has every chance of springing a surprise Saturday. ""We've played a few times, but she's a Top 10 player,"" she added. ""She has a good forehand with big spin and is quite fast on the backhand. ""She moves very well, too. She has had great results in the past and played quite well today, and she beat Petrova yesterday too. She's a very tough opponent. ""I think it will be a really tough match tomorrow.""

It's usually a peaceful, very English county town - but tonight Lewes in East Sussex is aflame with its annual Bonfire Night celebrations. Tens of thousands lined the streets in the small market town to watch the fiery procession, which traces its roots to the 16th century reign of Mary I and the Guy Fawkes Gunpowder Plot of 1605. It is just one of many November 5 gatherings up and down the country, with the night sky illuminated by colourful pyrotechnics. While some will strike lucky with the weather, others won't be so fortunate as their fireworks displays are spoilt by torrential rain. Temperatures are expected to plummet close to freezing, making this the coldest Bonfire Night in 14 years. Scroll down for video . March of the flaming crosses: Lewes residents lined the streets in their hundreds to watch the procession of 17 flaming crosses to represent the Protestant martyrs burnt at the stake in the town in the 16th century . Spectacular show: Participants in the parade hold flaming torches to light up the chilly night air. Forecasters said tonight will be the coldest November 5 for over a decade . Religious connection: The flame procession in Lewes has its roots in the 16th century. In previous years, 80,000 people have lined the streets to watch as many as 3,000 marchers brandishing torches . All ages: Young participants in the festivities, which also link to the infamous Guy Fawkes Gunpowder Plot against the Houses of Parliament in 1605 . Step back in time: The shops and buildings on the main streets of Lewes may have changed, but this is one annual tradition that holds strong . Showpiece: Crowds and marchers gathered around the Lewes war memorial to light crosses. An effigy of Guy Fawkes, who died in 1606 after an unsuccessful attempt to blow up Parliament, is also burnt . The procession, organised annually by six local societies, traces its roots to the 16th century and marks a tumultuous time in English history. A key part of the parade is seventeen flaming crosses, one for each of the Protestant martyrs burnt at the stake in the town between 1555 and 1557 as part of the Marian Prosecutions. The purge was initiated by the Roman Catholic monarch Queen Mary, who reigned between 1553 and 1558, and passed strict anti-Protestant legislation against anyone guilty of heresy against the Pope. Smoky: This marcher seemed to be creating his own trail of thick red smoke as he made his way through the streets of Lewes . Ritual: Crowds cluster round as dozens of marchers with burning torches perform a ceremony . Burn him! The effigy of Guy Fawkes is carried through the streets to be set alight . Spooky: Halloween may have been last week but there were still plenty of scary characters in the parade . At least three hundred were martyred in just five years - many meeting a fiery end on the stake and others hung, drawn and quartered. It is just a part of a number of parades and displays of pyrotechnics in the town - which can attract as many as 80,000 despite the place only having a population of 16,000. An effigy of Guy Fawkes, who died in 1606 a year after an unsuccessful plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament with Gunpowder. The Lewes event has previously courted controversy - in 2001, an effigy of Osama Bin Laden attracted national attention, as did the 2003 choice of a gypsy caravan. A fiery history: The seventeen flaming crosses in the parade represent the 17 martyrs who were burnt at the stake in Lewes as part of the Marian persecutions against Protestants in the reign of Mary I . History lesson: The Lewes Bonfire Night celebrations mark, in part, the Marian Persecutions of 1555-1557, a purge of Protestant religious reformers during the reign of Roman Catholic monarch Mary I. Heresy against the Catholic faith was punishable by death, with some burnt at the stake, as in Lewes, and other hung, drawn and quartered . While the flames remained alight in Lewes, others in the country saw their Bonfire Night pyrotechnics washed out by heavy rain. A number of fireworks displays were cancelled after heavy deluges of rain caused flash flooding in Dorset, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire the worst affected. It follows the cancellation of a number of large displays over the weekend, including one in Newham, East London and in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. In all, the Environment Agency issued seven flood warning in England and Wales on Monday morning, covering areas of the South-West, South-East, East Anglia, the Midlands and Wales.There were also 53 flood alerts in operation .In Carmarthenshire, nine adults and six children had to be rescued from a caravan park as flood waters rose on Sunday evening.

"(CNN)  -- Bordeaux clinched the French league title with a 1-0 win over Caen on a dramatic final day of the season. Bordeaux's fans celebrate their first French league title in 10 years. Laurent Blanc's men were ending Lyon's seven-year hold on the domestic championship and winning Bordeaux's first title in 10 years. A goal from Yoan Gouffran early in the second half secured their 11th straight win and their second trophy of the season having won the French League Cup in April. The defeat saw Caen drop to the second flight and kept Bordeaux three points clear of second-placed Marseille who won 4-0 at home to Rennes to keep up the pressure to the last. Senegal international striker Mamadou Niang scored twice with Ivory Coast star  Bakari Kone also on target, but it was not enough. Lyon closed their season with a 0-0 draw at Toulouse and their third place finish secures a place in the qualifying round for the Champions League.

"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — A large shark was killed off the west Australian coast on Sunday, the first under a contentious new state government culling policy aimed at curbing fatal shark attacks. 
  
 The Western Australia government on Saturday began placing baited hooks on drum lines off popular beaches in the state capital Perth and to the south to kill white, bull and tiger sharks over three meters (10 feet) long. 
  
 The policy is a response to seven fatal shark attacks in Australia's southwest in three years. 
  
 Government spokesman Simon Beaumont said the first shark was killed by a government-contracted commercial fisherman on Sunday morning off Castle Rock near the town of Dunsborough, 250 kilometers (155 miles) south of Perth. 
  
 The shark was longer than three meters (10 feet) and was one of the three targeted species. Beaumont would not say which of the three species it was. 
  
 Once the fisherman had confirmed with fishing authorities that the shark was the required species and size, he shot it and dumped the carcass at sea, Beaumont said. 
  
 The policy has divided the community since it was announced several weeks ago and led to thousands of people demonstrating on Perth beaches against the shark cull. 
  
 Activists have threatened to sabotage the drum lines and threatened one fisherman who had accepted a government contract to catch sharks off Perth. He pulled out, citing the threats. 
  
 The federal government last week gave state authorities a special exemption from environmental laws to kill white sharks, a protected species. 
  
 Environmentalists argue that there is no evidence that the cull will reduce shark attacks. They argue it could even increase the shark danger by giving water users a false sense of security. 
  
 ""To think that we're wasting this opportunity to tag and to find out more about these creatures, that we're just going to slaughter them and dump them — it's just such a waste of life,"" Rae Threnoworth, member of marine conservation group Sea Shepherd, told Ten Network television. 
  
 State Premier Colin Barnett was heckled by members of the public over the shark's death as he officiated at a citizenship ceremony in Perth on Sunday. 
  
 ""I get no pleasure out of seeing sharks killed,"" Barnett told reporters. ""But I have an overriding responsibility to protect the people of Western Australia. That's what I'm doing."" ||||| The first shark is caught under the drum line policy. Pictures: Sharon Smith/The West Australian 
  
 Premier Colin Barnett says he gets no pleasure at seeing sharks killed but his responsibility as Premier was the safety of beachgoers. 
  
 Speaking today after the first shark was caught and kill under the State Government's drum line policy, Mr Barnett said he was pleased the shark mitigation plan was underway and that it would reduce the risk to beachgoers. 
  
 The shark, which appeared to be a 3m tiger shark, was pulled from the water shortly after 7am on a drum-line off Meelup Beach near Dunsborough. 
  
 It was shot in the head up to four times at close range. 
  
 Yesterday afternoon, amid pressure from the Government for the policy to come into force in time for the Australia Day long weekend, several lines were set either side of Dunsborough. 
  
 Despite fierce opposition and repeated claims of ""direct action"", environmental activists have not intervened. 
  
 The shark has been dumped off Cape Naturaliste. 
  
 The first of the baited hooks was set around Old Dunsborough beach at 2.25pm yesterday. 
  
 Mr Barnett said he was not surprised how quickly a shark was caught under the new shark mitigation plan. 
  
 “There are a lot of sharks down there,” he said. 
  
 “Anecdotal evidence is sufficiently strong that there has been a significant increase in the shark population and even more aggressive behaviour by sharks. 
  
 “Until we can provide that protection and safety, the program will continue on."" 
  
 Mr Barnett was heckled at a citizenship ceremony this morning where a person in the crowd yelled that ""what you're doing with the sharks is wrong"". 
  
 He appeared undeterred by recent protests about the shark policy. 
  
 “I respect and acknowledge and people have different points of view and there are protestors, but my responsibility as Premier is the safety of beachgoers,” he said. 
  
 “I get no pleasure at seeing sharks killed but I have an overriding responsibility to protect the people of Western Australia and that’s what I’m doing.” 
  
 “When you have sharks of three, four, five metres long of known aggressive varieties, swimming in the water very close to beachgoers, that is imminent danger and reluctantly I have had to take that decision.” 
  
 Under the policy, baited drum lines are to be set 1km off the coast in Perth and the South West to catch great white, tiger and bull sharks bigger than 3m in length.

 Sea Shepherd's Jeff Hansen said the shark was “believed to be a beautiful tiger shark” more than three metres long. 
  
 The fisherman contracted to catch and kill in the South West will also lay the lines at beaches in Meelup, Castle Rock and Gracetown. 
  
 Earlier yesterday, a document appeared on the Department of Transport website implying metropolitan drum lines would also be in place by Monday.

 ""Mariners are advised that a number of Government of Western Australia shark drum lines have been deployed within 1km offshore of the following metropolitan and regional areas and will remain in place until April 30,” it said. 
  
 The notice, due to be published in The West Australian on Monday, has since been changed. 
  
 A spokesman acknowledged the error and said the wording had been corrected to include the words “will soon be deployed in the metropolitan region”. 
  
 ""The fact remains, baited drum lines will be placed at popular metropolitan beaches as soon as possible, and mariners need to be advised there are exclusion zones around these deployments,” he said. 
  
 Picture: Rob Scott/7 News 
  
 Labor spokeswoman Sue Ellery said it was another example of the Government botching the implementation of the policy. 
  
 “All they have done today is confuse mariners with the notice on the Department of Transport website,” she said. 
  
 “If the lines are eventually ever actually dropped in the metropolitan area, how will metro boat users know which notice to believe?” 
  
 Conservationists are reportedly in Dunsborough today and are preparing to free any animals that are caught by the drum lines. 
  
 It is believed about 20 people from conservation group Animal Rescue Team are in the area with scuba diving equipment and an inflatable boat. 
  
 The Government yesterday announced the shark barrier designed to protect beachgoers at Old Dunsborough beach had been completed. 
  
 The $165,000 barrier, based on those used on the Gold Coast to prevent bull shark attacks, has been built as part of the City of Busselton’s beach enclosure trial. 
  
 The enclosure has six metal piles drilled into the seabed supporting a 100m x 300m mesh barrier. |||||","– The first shark has been killed off Western Australia under a controversial new policy aimed at protecting swimmers from attacks.

"The allegations came to light after Scott Rogers, 52, a former dance academy teacher in Suffolk, was shot at his home in Iberville, Louisiana.
Two British men have told a US radio station they were abused by Mr Rogers.
Computers and mobile phones have been seized from Mr Rogers' house as part of the investigation into his death.
The Iberville sheriff's office said the WAFB-TV presenter was thought to have been shot by former lover Mathew Hodgkinson - also his son-in-law - who they believe then shot himself in the head.
Mr Hodgkinson, 36, who was married to Mr Rogers' daughter Kimmie, remains in hospital in an induced coma but has started to show signs of life.
On Tuesday he was seen to move and deputies are confident he has brain activity, reports WBRZ News 2.
Following Mr Rogers' death, two men gave an interview with the Jim Engster Radio Show on WRKF in Baton Rouge alleging they were repeatedly sexually abused by the dance teacher as children.
One said he was aware of allegations made against Mr Rogers by the age of 12 and said he began becoming ""intimate"" with him when he was 13.
""The truth is... when I met that man I was 12 years old... he was introducing concepts like love to me, through sex he was informing my understanding of physical intimacy,"" the man said.
""He would guide me in how to speak to my parents on what to say to people.
The man said he heard about Mr Rogers' death while waiting to testify before a grand jury over information supplied to the US authorities by the TV host.
Mr Rogers is thought to have failed to declare the fact he had been arrested in the UK when applying to become a foster parent in the US.
A second British man told the radio show that Mr Rogers was ""a master manipulator, an expert at brainwashing"".
He said: ""He is the worst predatory paedophile that you could imagine and when you are a child and you are faced with that type of monster with that type of intelligent mind, you don't stand a chance.""
Sheriff Brett Stassi, of Iberville police, told the BBC: ""My concern is just with the murder-suicide at this time.
""If some of these computers or phones open up to some child pornography or something we'll go in that direction - but we have no evidence of that as this time.
""All I can say is the life he left in the UK was among a conversation of sexual abuse - but not here.
""It was only before the continued custody hearing we heard for the first time why he left the UK.""
The abuse is alleged to have happened in the UK in the early 1990s.
Mr Rogers, then 28, was arrested by Suffolk Police following an allegation of sexual assault against a 13-year-old boy in June 1991 at the Bury St Edmunds Academy of Dance, Suffolk Police said.
In May 1992, he was charged with a number of sex offences and in June 1993 stood trial at the Inner London Crown Court, where a jury failed to reach a verdict.
The judge discharged the jury and no retrial took place, meaning Mr Rogers was acquitted.
He left the UK in the mid-1990s after an arts academy he founded in Bury St Edmunds was likened to a ""cult"".
In 1995, BBC Look East reported that Suffolk County Council had ""taken the unusual step"" of issuing a warning to parents about the Academy of Dance and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds.
There were claims of an ""unhealthy atmosphere"" similar to ""a religious or supposedly religious cult"" at the school founded by Mr Rogers, the East Anglian Daily Times has reported.
A Suffolk County Council spokeswoman said the council ""was made aware before the fatal incident that services in Baton Rouge were investigating Richard Scott Rogers"".
""Suffolk County Council and Suffolk Police are supporting and assisting those services,"" she said.
""We will be keeping this matter under review and if anyone would like to make contact about this case you can do by calling Suffolk Police.""","A US TV host who is thought to have been murdered by his ex-lover was a ""monster"" who sexually abused boys, it has been claimed."
"This week, the U.S. Navy forsook a tradition dating back to the 1800s. Why? Because it's now too easily confused with the musings of an Internet lunatic. Naval commanders this week announced that they would be getting rid of a rule that all official communications should be in all-caps. It's a tradition dating to the 1850s, when the military used teletype machines that didn't have lowercase letters. The change is meant to simplify communication and is supposed to save the Navy $15 million because it can get rid of a dedicated messaging service and use regular old e-mail instead. But we have to think not wanting to sound like you're shouting at someone who SAID SOMETHING WRONG ON THE INTERNET played a role, too. The most gentle message can come across as psychotically aggressive when typed in all caps. So as the Navy transitions, we decided to round up five of our favorite examples of all-cap craziness. The Kanye mea culpa . Perhaps it's not a rant, as such. (Though he's certainly been no stranger to them). But we had to go with the time Kanye West slammed down the caps lock to apologize, on his blog, for his infamous stage-bombing of Taylor Swift at the 2009 Video Music Awards. ""I'M SOOOOO SORRY TO TAYLOR SWIFT AND HER FANS AND HER MOM. I SPOKE TO HER MOTHER RIGHT AFTER AND SHE SAID THE SAME THING MY MOTHER WOULD'VE SAID. SHE IS VERY TALENTED! I LIKE THE LYRICS ABOUT BEING A CHEERLEADER AND SHE'S IN THE BLEACHERS! ........................ I'M IN THE WRONG FOR GOING ON STAGE AND TAKING AWAY FROM HER MOMENT!................."" Of course, in the grand tradition of half-apologies, he spends several of his remaining loud sentences justifying the moment he interrupted Swift's acceptance speech to say that Beyonce should have won instead of her. ""BEYONCE'S VIDEO WAS THE BEST OF THIS DECADE!!!! I... WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD!!!! EVERYBODY WANNA BOOOOO ME BUT I'M A FAN OF REAL POP CULTURE!!! ... I'M STILL HAPPY FOR TAYLOR!!!! BOOOYAAAWWWW!!!! YOU ARE VERY VERY TALENTED!!! ...  I'M NOT CRAZY YALL, I'M JUST REAL."" Gotcha. The Bakery flame-out . Having your restaurant appear on ""Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares"" is bad enough. Having the host quit on you because you're too hard to work with is even worse. Flaming out about it on Facebook in a series of profanity-laced all-caps outbursts? Priceless. Amy's Baking Company, in Scottsdale, Arizona, experienced just that last month after appearing on the show with the famously acerbic chef. So, after the show aired, the smart thing to do would be to take to social media to calmly explain how your restaurant was misrepresented, right? Or, you can try this: . ""WE DO NOT NEED THIS. YOU STUPID PEOPLE. ... DO NOT BLAME US BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT AFFORD QUALITY. THE YELPERS, AND NOW THE REDDITS, NEED TO BACK OFF. YOURE NOT RIGHT BECAUSE OF SOME TV SHOW."" A Facebook freakout? Wrong you are, apparently: . ""WE ARE NOT FREAKING OUT WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT A 'WITCH HUNT' I AM NOT A WITCH. I AM GODS CHILD. P--- OFF ALL OF YOU. F--- REDDITS, F--- YELP AND F--- ALL OF YOU. BRING IT. WE WILL FIGHT BACK."" Believe us when we tell you they were just getting started. Things got so bad that Amy's has since created a new Facebook page. Nearly a month later, let's just say that it's still not polite coffee talk. The Comic Sans LeBron slam . Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert's 2010 open letter to fans after LeBron James left the team for the shores of South Beach is mainly remembered for another typographical choice. His fiery screed was typed in Comic Sans -- an Internet-reviled font that is sort of hard to read without giggling. But it was the single sentence he decided to go all-caps with that makes this list: . ""I PERSONALLY GUARANTEE THAT THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS WILL WIN AN NBA CHAMPIONSHIP BEFORE THE SELF-TITLED FORMER 'KING' WINS ONE"" As you NBA fans may have noted, James already has one title under his belt with the Miami Heat and he's currently in the finals playing for number two. The Cavs? Still waiting. I'll tweet you, babe . OK, Cher, we get it. Donald Trump rubs a lot of people the wrong way. From the tone-deaf self-promotion to the strident political views, Mr. Apprentice has mixed it up with everyone from irreverent sports blog Deadspin to CNN's own Wolf Blitzer. So when the pop-music icon caught on to an effort to boycott Trump's line of neckties, she was so worked up she had to do it in all-caps. ""I'll NEVER GO TO MACY'S AGAIN! I didn't know they sold Donald Trump's Line! If they don't care that they sell products from a LOUDMOUTH,"" Cher wrote on Twitter. Then:  ""RACIST CRETIN,WHO'D LIE LIKE 'HIS RUG' TO GET SOME CHEAP PRESS! I CANT BELIEVE MACY'S THINKS HE'S THE RIGHT 'MAN' 2 REPRESENT THEIR NAME!"" Say what you will about The Donald. At least he didn't resort to all-caps in his response. ""@cher should spend more time focusing on her family and dying career!"" Trump wrote. We didn't say it was classy. Just that it wasn't in all-caps. Drunk Hulk Is drunk . OK, we didn't say they were the worst all-caps rants. Just the top ones. And it's hard to top an enormous green rage monster who has knocked back a few too many. Twitter's Drunk Hulk, one of our favorite parody accounts, tweets sort of exactly like you'd imagine a witty, pre-intervention Hulk would tackle the topics of the day. On government surveillance: ""IT GREAT GOVERNMENT RECORD EVERY PHONE CALL! NOW DRUNK HULK FIND OUT WHAT WAS SAID WHEN DRUNK HULK CALL YOU LAST NIGHT!"" On really sad fantasy epics: ""GAME OF THRONES! GO TO YOUR ROOM! AND THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DONE!"" On a Billy Joel classic: ""IF YOU SEE MAN MAKING LOVE TO TONIC AND GIN AT BAR! NO SING SONG ABOUT IT! CALL POLICE IMMEDIATELY!"" His whole Twitter feed is an all-caps rant. And we're not going to tell him to stop, are you? What did we miss? Let us know about some of your favorite rants in the comments.","The U.S. Navy has announced it will no longer communicate in all-caps .

"(CNN) -- Sheryl Sandberg wants young girls to ""ban bossy,"" but for those of us soon-to-graduate, just-graduated and will-I-ever-graduate ladies just entering the working world, there's another word that's even more toxic. That word is ""pushy."" At least, that's what my Lean In Circle thinks. A new book by Sandberg, ""Lean In: For Graduates,"" targets women like us, but we were already paying attention. My Circle is all 20-somethings with dreams of media industry success. We wanted our group to exist as a third-wave feminist answer to boys clubs, with their oak-paneled rooms and clouds of cigar smoke. We share job announcements, work dilemmas and interviewing tips and tricks. A guy recently asked me, ""Lean In Circle -- is that, like, a book club?"" Sort of. Not quite. According to Sandberg's Lean In Foundation, 14,000 Lean In Circles meet regularly around the globe, and we don't just reread ""Lean In"" over mimosas. Lean In Circles were conceived as ""small peer groups that allow you to learn and share in an atmosphere of confidentiality and trust."" The Washington Post described the ethos as ""Alcoholics Anonymous fused with Girl Scouts,"" and I have yet to find a more accurate depiction of my particular Circle environment. And so we formed, and rallied around our Circle mission: to sit at the table and push back against ""pushy"" to find our first jobs. 'Wait your turn' My mom was one of many who cautioned their daughters with the same advice: Wait your turn, don't be pushy. But when I was 22, still in college, interning at a magazine in New York City and illegally subletting a run-down room, that advice just wasn't cutting it anymore. I was one semester away from graduation and the real world, and I was dreading it. One of my internship supervisors jokingly introduced me to a colleague: ""This is Julia Carpenter, and she is terrified that she will graduate without a job."" It was true. Many of my peers moved back home with their parents to wait out this horrific economy, and unequivocally, they were miserable. Many of my friends in journalism moved to cities like New York or San Francisco and waited months for a job. Some worked multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet, and every day without a lead meant more hope slipping away. When I was reading ""Lean In"" within the mouse-ridden confines of my apartment, Sandberg's words stoked the long-squelched dreams that had always hovered in the top pages of my journals. As an English major and a journalism student, many of the feminist tenets in ""Lean In"" weren't new to me, but they also weren't applicable to me yet. She urges women to find supportive significant others who will see a relationship as a partnership, not a trade-off. Many of her stories about the intersection of family planning, motherhood and careerdom didn't have much of an effect. Those were things I'd been reading about in women's studies textbooks for years, examples of how progressive society had helped women out of the home and into the workplace and back. What was new to me was her practical application of these sometimes abstract concepts. For every lesson, Sandberg had a story to share about boardroom drama at Facebook, Google and elsewhere. In my young life, I hadn't had any Peggy Olson moments in which men looked up my skirt in the office or openly critiqued me for being a woman in a college classroom. Instead, Sandberg's vivid depictions of workplace inequality -- of women who were constantly overlooked for the promotion, of female executives too shy to raise their hands in team discussion -- resonated as examples of the gender bias traps still harming women's success. I had been passed on for projects because of reasons like ""Why would a girl be interested in politics?"" and the word ""bitch"" had been thrown at me to end a conversation. Sandberg's examples provided simple solutions: Speak with purpose. Sit at the table. Sandberg writes that many women struggle to be bold in workplace. In my case, it was in the world of job hunting. We fear that putting ourselves out there means we will be perceived as ""pushy."" No one wants to be called that dreaded word just as she's trying to get a job. I realized that not pushing hard enough for the job that I wanted was even scarier than not having a job. I feared that I would be waiting in the wings, clutching my pages-long rÃ©sumÃ© and feeling insecure, as droves of confident, talented men dared to sit at the table. I knew to get that dream job, I was going to have to push forward and sit right beside those guys, just as Sandberg wrote. 'Is there a job there for me?' Closing that confidence gap isn't easy, especially after a lifetime of ""Wait your turn."" I read that when Sandberg was job hunting -- honestly, more like ""job picking"" -- then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt gave her some invaluable advice, which ultimately became my guidepost. ""Only one criterion matters when picking a job -- fast growth."" In my own job hunt, in the midst of interviewing and applying, I found myself playing the same neurotic games many of my female peers have copped to: ""Did they even get my application?"" ""Oh my God, they hated my application"" and of course, ""Why did I even send in an application, I suck."" On the other hand, men send in applications even if they meet just some of the listed qualifications. ""I've been really forward (almost to the point of being pushy?) in the last year,"" a member of our Lean In Circle told me. ""But the only consequence there might've been for that is not getting a response to an application."" Not all of Sandberg's advice resonated with my Circle. Business cards and job titles don't mean much to us, and unlike many of Sandberg's contemporaries, we've come up in a startup culture that eschews formalism. ""A lot of my job search happened over beers, over shared criticisms, over social media interactions,"" said one member of my Circle. ""If I said some of the suggested scripts she uses in the book, the person I was talking to would think I was a robot. When members of my Circle discuss job prospects -- which we're doing ever-more-frequently as members prep for graduation -- the first question we ask isn't ""What's the position?"" Instead, it's ""What would you be doing?"" The day before I graduated from college, I received a job offer from the magazine where I had interned while reading ""Lean In."" The job was awesome. I would be living in a city I loved, working with amazing people and doing something I knew I was good at. But my heart was still set on another opportunity. A member of my Circle had referred me for a sweet spot on the Washington Post's digital engagement team, but after a few rounds of interviews I was still waiting for an answer. ""You just have to wait,"" people told me. My newly Sheryl-fied inner voice said otherwise. I called and explained the situation. ""Is there a job there for me?"" I remember saying. ""We were going to offer you the job tomorrow,"" my now-boss said. ""So -- what are you thinking?"" 'That's my girl' At a recent brunch with a college friend, she told me she's happy at her job, but looking for the next step, hopefully a new gig that will allow her to travel and improve her skills. ""I want to e-mail these giants in my field to introduce myself and ask about job openings,"" she said. ""But I don't want to. I don't want to impose. They're going to be like 'Who is this girl? Why is she e-mailing me?' And I know my male colleagues wouldn't think twice. They'd send that e-mail."" I immediately made a mental note to add her to our Circle. I know my Circle members would say it's an ongoing struggle for women in the workplace, and you have to lean in bit by bit. They're right. If anything else, you need to do it to improve the quality of workplaces for other women, even on the days when the confidence gap thwarts your plans to proceed boldly. So even when I couldn't find a connection with Sandberg's discussion of work-life balance and motherhood or the buttoned-up culture of top tech executives, ""Lean In"" can't just be written off as a book for mid-level career women. For me and my Circle -- all women new to our first job or still in college and looking for that first job -- Sandberg's simple suggestion to proceed boldly, empowered us to look at the job hunt and our workplace interactions. We're wary of the gender gap not just in salary, but in how it shapes discussion and assignment in our offices. Even in the early days of a new gig, we're committed to closing that confidence (and achievement) gap. That's something we can take away from the pages. That's why a Circle is more than just a book club. In the middle of a conference call at work last week, I jumped into the conversation. ""I can explain this,"" I said, and launched into a short description of a project my team and I had been rolling out. ""When you said 'I can explain this,' you actually leaned in,"" a female colleague said to me afterward. ""You physically leaned in closer to the desk. I was like, 'That's my girl.'""

"(CNN) -- English cricketer Kevin Pietersen has reached an agreement with the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB) which paves the way for his return to the national team. Arguably England's most naturally talented cricketer, Pietersen was dropped by selectors in August after it emerged he had sent ""provocative"" text messages to South Africa's players during a recent Test series between the two teams. However the South-African born Pietersen must undergo a ""reintegration program"", before England team director Andy Flower can pick him. ""ECB and Kevin Pietersen confirm that agreement has been reached concerning a process for his reintegration into the England team during the remainder of 2012,"" said an ECB statement. ""Upon completion of the program, the England selectors will consider Kevin for future matches."" Without Pietersen, who was born in South Africa, defending champions England crashed out of the World T20 tournament in Sri Lanka at the Super Eight stage. Two years ago the allrounder was man of the tournament when England, captained by Paul Collingwood, were crowned T20 world champions in the Caribbean. In May, Pietersen had announced his retirement from T20 and one-day cricket, although he was in Sri Lanka working as a broadcaster for ESPN Star Sports. Andrew Strauss, who was England captain when Pietersen was frozen out of the team, has since retired from international cricket, with Alastair Cook the side's new Test skipper. ""Kevin Pietersen has apologized to Andrew Strauss and wishes to express to all those who support England his regrets at the impact the recent controversies have had on the England team,"" continued the ECB statement. ""He now wishes to put the events of the summer behind him and to focus on regaining his place in the England team."" The ECB went on to say the issue regarding messages sent from Pietersen's Blackberry mobile phone had been resolved. ""With regards the issue of the BBM messages, due to the fact that Kevin had not retained the BBM messages, this matter has been successfully concluded through a binding assurance provided to ECB by Kevin. ""Kevin conceded that the messages exchanged were provocative. The ECB is satisfied, following receipt of this binding assurance, that to the best of his recollection, Kevin did not convey any messages which were derogatory about the England captain, the England team director, the ECB or employees of the ECB. ""Furthermore, there was no tactical information whatsoever provided to members of the South African touring party."" ECB chairman Giles Clarke refused to put a timescale on when Pietersen might return. ""Kevin has signed a central contract today,"" Clarke told a media conference. ""Andy Flower will determine the progress of the reintegration process. It could be soon, it could be much later."" Pietersen admitted the situation had been difficult, but insisted he was focused on regaining his place in the team. ""It's been a horrible situation for all involved,"" said the 32-year-old cricketer. ""But it is time to move forward. All being well I'll be back in an England shirt as soon as possible."" Before he was dropped, Pietersen has been integral part of the England Test team since making his debut in 2005. He has scored 21 centuries in 81 Test matches for his country and was given the honor of captaining England's one-day team in 2008. The right-hander, who is an occasional spin bowler, will be hoping to win back his place in the team in time for November and December's tour of India.","Kevin Pietersen agrees return to the England cricket team .

"Damon Smith denies making or possessing an explosive substance with intent to endanger life but at the Old Bailey he admitted perpetrating a bomb hoax.
The prosecution said Mr Smith intended the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) to explode and endanger the lives of people on the Jubilee Line train.
Prosecutors said the IED contained ball bearings to act as shrapnel.
Jonathan Rees QC, for the prosecution, said this was to ""increase the destructive effect of the device"".
At the start of the trial, Mr Rees said the defendant told police he had built a device which when activated was intended only to produce smoke.
However, the defendant added the ball bearings because he wanted to make it look like a real bomb so the train would be stopped and it would be reported on the news, Mr Rees added.
The court heard the device was found by two passengers when Mr Smith got off the train at London Bridge station last October.
They handed it to a driver, Adrian Clarke, who initially thought it was for lost property but then, as he drove to North Greenwich, realised it contained two wires coming out of the back of a clock, the court heard.
The court heard the student had moved to Rotherhithe in south-east London with his mother from Newton Abbot, Devon, when he started a computer forensics degree at London Metropolitan University.
The defendant has Asperger's syndrome, or Autism Spectrum Disorder as it was known, and has a keen interest in guns and other weapons that may have been a function of the condition, the court heard.
The prosecution said officers had found:
The court heard Mr Smith told police he had been brought up a Christian but was interested in Islam which he thought was ""more true"".
He did not really practise Islam, although he read the Quran and sometimes prayed in the morning when it was convenient but did not hold extreme views, the court heard.
Mr Rees said that on the day of the incident the defendant had started a timing mechanism on the device while he was at Southwark station, changing trains.
Meanwhile, Mr Smith went to his university campus at Holloway and searched for news articles on the incident when he got home later, the court heard.
The trial continues.","A student has admitted building a bomb and leaving it on a Tube train but said it was for a prank, a court heard."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:17 EST, 12 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:57 EST, 13 June 2012 . A dentist suffered a near fatal stroke after performing a particularly gruelling tooth extraction. Sporty Andy Davies, 33, managed to admit himself to hospital in Birmingham after falling ill in November 2011. His stroke was so severe he experienced 'locked-in' syndrome and was unable to lift a limb, speak or breathe without a ventilator. His only way of communicating was through his eyelids. Hopeful: Today Andy's condition is stable and he is gradually and slowly regaining strength and movement . Mr Davies's mother Barbara, from Liverpool, said Andy believed the extraction was probably to blame. He began to suffer from headaches and neck pain before eventually admitting himself to hospital where it was discovered he'd torn an artery in his neck causing a bleed on his brain stem . Doctors at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth hospital fought to save Mr Davies's life after the stroke. He was then put into an induced coma by medical staff to allow his body to cope with the massive trauma he suffered last November. Doctors caring for him have been amazed at his recovery from a bleed that could have easily killed him. Mr Davies - who qualified at Birmingham and has a practice in the city - was unable to move at all for around 10 weeks until life began to flicker back into his hands and legs. Today Andy’s condition is stable and he . is gradually and slowly regaining strength and movement, learning to . sit, stand, walk and talk again. The family are also hopeful he will . soon have sufficient strength to feed himself again. He is currently being cared for at rehabilitation centre called Moseley Hall, in Birmingham, although his funding is due to run out in the next few months. Mrs Davies, 27, said: 'My husband is an extraordinary man. He has achieved so much in his career and helped so many people. 'He has offered support to ex-offenders, drug users and single mums through his involvement with our church. 'Despite the poor prognosis offered by doctors after the stroke, I am confident Andy will make a recovery. This is a story of hope.' Mr Davies was a keen climber and skier before his stroke . Andy, who had been a keen climber and skier, has been able to return to his home in Bourneville a couple of times. Last weekend he stayed overnight at home and was able to attend a friend’s wedding. His mother Barbara added: 'The stroke was horrific and this has been a terrible ordeal for all the family. 'I would like to thank all the hospital staff who have helped Andy.' Andy qualified at Birmingham University in 2002, becoming the first dyslexic to qualify as a UK dentist. Since then he has worked for the NHS in general dental practice in Birmingham  where he met Emma. And the pair were married in 2008. Mr Davies was the first dyslexic to qualify as a UK dentist. He hopes one day to return to work . Emma, a teacher said: 'We were told that if Andy survived he would be left with ‘Locked in Syndrome’ which would leave him unable to communicate or move with no prospect of any independent life. We were told to prepare for the worst and that people didn’t recover form such situations.' She added: 'No one is quite sure what caused the stroke although Andy thinks the trigger was the tooth extraction which may have damaged the artery and caused it to split later.' The couple are both Christians and Emma believes the power of prayer and the help of doctors has aided Andy’s remarkable recovery. Emma said: 'We believe God answered our prayers when Andy was initially given no hope.' Andy's mother said: 'He is now able to sit on the edge of a bed for three and a half minutes; when he first came to Moseley he could only sit for 30 seconds. 'His standing has also improved. Just ten weeks ago he started out using a standing frame, which mechanically raised him into a standing position and held him there. 'Now Andy no longer needs a hoist and can push himself up and briefly hold it there with the assistance of therapists, who help with the process.' Emma said: 'Thousands of people round the world have been following Andy’s blog and have been praying for him. He’s come a long way since those dark days in November but there’s still a lot work to be done. We are hopeful that he will walk unaided again and we pray that he may one day go back to work.'

"(CNN) -- Nanci Griffith wanted to look on the bright side. Nanci Griffith, who says she's ""fed up with negativity,"" was revitalized by the election of Barack Obama. And who could blame her? In the past decade, Griffith -- perhaps best known for her Grammy-winning 1993 album, ""Other Voices, Other Rooms"" -- had faced a political climate she didn't agree with, as well as recovery from thyroid and breast cancer, which she was diagnosed with in the late '90s. Songwriting had become a struggle for the singer with the gentle, crystalline voice. ""It was ... horrific,"" she said simply. However, with her latest album, ""The Loving Kind"" (Rounder), Griffith is as focused and passionate as she has been in years. Sparked by the changes in her life and American politics, she said, music has been vital to her personal resurgence. ""It was nice to focus on things outside of my body. Music has always done that for me,"" she said. Describing herself as someone who was ""fed up with negativity,"" Griffith was equally inspired by her fellow countrymen. ""[The] American people will not let this country collapse,"" she said. The idea motivated her to look at her country's dark path of injustice not so long ago, stories that worked their way into her songwriting. ""In some ways, I'm just a journalist. I [want] my audience to hear these stories,"" she said. CNN spoke with Griffith from her home in Nashville, Tennessee. CNN: Being a folk singer and your views being what they are, was it tougher or maybe easier to write songs from 2000 to 2008? Nanci Griffith: It was very difficult for me. I was hurt by the direction my country was going in. And then, after [the 2008 election], everything came spilling out. Things came along like the Mildred and Richard Loving case (""The Loving Kind""), where Mildred died, and I read her obituary. [The Lovings were a couple whose interracial marriage was against the law in Virginia at the time.] That was such an inspiration. ... Just wondering why I never knew about this and how important that case is currently with equality in marriage. Little things. Bit by bit, my heart started to open up again, and I could write! CNN: Had you ever gone through that before? Griffith: No, never in my life. I've always been a very prolific writer. CNN: Now, what about writing in the age of Obama? Griffith: (laughs) It feels great! People may be down on their luck, financially. But I see so much optimism about the direction of the country and [general] openness. CNN: Now, in addition to ""The Loving Kind,"" there are other songs based on actual events on this record. Tell me about ""Not Innocent Enough."" Griffith: That's based on Philip Workman's case in Memphis [Tennessee]. He was robbing a Wendy's -- was a heroin addict -- and police came in, and an officer was killed. Now, Workman didn't kill him; it was friendly fire. Workman was convicted anyway and executed. I'm a total abolitionist when it comes to the death penalty, but this case really stunned me, because I feel like this country has evolved enough to where we shouldn't have to live with the death penalty. CNN: Is it hard as a writer/musician to inhabit those songs, knowing that they are actual events? Griffith: Not really. I feel like, in some ways, I'm just a journalist. I don't express my opinion [in the songs], necessarily. But it's important to me that my audience hear these stories. I want as many people to know about Loving v. Virginia as possible. CNN: Do you feel like it's a more palatable way to become aware of a story like that when a song is attached to it? Griffith: I do. I've been informed many times through music. Pete Seeger, Odetta, Dave Van Ronk, Bruce Springsteen ... so many folk songwriters. It's all around you. CNN: The song ""Still Life"" -- I suspect that's about President George W. Bush? Griffith: It's about people like him. This country is full of them, and especially my home state of Texas. It's a [perspective on] people who go through life getting away with everything. CNN: Do you feel a sense of vindication with President Obama's election, or at least a sense that things are moving in a direction you're in favor of? Griffith: I hope so. Right now, he is my hero. So is his wife. CNN: What in your past steered you into a topical songwriter? Griffith: I was always more interested in story songs, things with a point of view ... and things that informed me. CNN: Is there a different process of writing those topical songs versus a song like ""Up Against the Rain,"" which is clearly more personal? Griffith: There is a burden to writing [those topical songs]: You better have your facts straight. When you're writing a personal song like ""Rain,"" it's straight from your heart and seems to just flow. CNN: ""Sing"" seems like it would fit that description. Does that song sum up your life in a way? Griffith: Many have asked that, but I was actually inspired to write that by watching an interview with Shania Twain where she said it would not have mattered if she remained a lounge act for her whole career. It's not something you choose. It's just what you do.","Nanci Griffith's new album is ""The Loving Kind""

"By . Sarah Griffiths . His body was buried 600 years ago without any pomp and ceremony befitting of a king. But now the traditional funeral crown that Richard III never had, has gone on display in York. The golden headpiece was commissioned for the last king of the House of York by a leading historian who was involved in the archaeological dig that discovered Richard III’s remains beneath a car park in Leicester. Richard III's funeral crown (pictured) was commissioned by a leading historian who was involved in the archaeological dig that discovered Richard III¿s remains beneath a car park in Leicester . Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, ending the Wars of the Roses and the Plantagenet dynasty. His body was taken to Leicester by supporters of victorious Henry VII and buried in Greyfriars church, which is now the site of the council car park. Dr John Ashdown-Hill commissioned a 15th century-style gold-plated crown in tribute to the late king with white roses and gems. Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 and was buried without pomp and ceremony . The crown was made by medieval jewellery expert George Easton who was inspired to create the design from historical artefacts such as relics and illustrations relating to the contentious monarch. ‘The crown is plated with gold, with the circle set enamelled with white roses and pearls,’ The York Press reported. ‘On the roses are set rubies and sapphires, representing the livery colours of the house of York. The crosses of the crown have more enamelled white roses, set with emeralds and turquoises.’ The historian had the idea of commissioning the crown when he was carrying the king’s remains away from the archaeological site, having been involved in searching for the lost remains of the monarch. The funeral crown is now on show at the Richard III Experience in York's Monk Bar – one of the medieval gateways to York. It will go on tour around the UK before playing a part in the king’s reburial at Leicester Cathedral. It was announced earlier this week that Richard III will finally be laid to rest at Leicester Cathedral after judges said it was time for the monarch to be given a 'dignified burial'. Distant relatives opposed plans to bury him in the city after his remains were discovered in a council car park. They said he should be placed in York Minster because it was a wish of 'the last medieval king of England'. The skeleton of Richard III  was discovered at the Greyfriars excavation site in Leicester, which was a church and is now the site of a car park. Now there is a 15th century-style gold-plated crown in tribute to the late king . Regal: The crown is plated with gold, with enamelled white roses. There are rubies and saphires at the centre of the roses representing the livery colours of the house of York . But the High Court told the claimants, who are part of the Plantagenet Alliance, there was no reason to interfere with the initial plans. Three judges said in a joint ruling: 'Since Richard III’s exhumation on September 5 2012, passions have been roused and much ink has been spilt. 'Issues relating to his life and death and place of re-interment have been exhaustively examined and debated. 'The Very Reverend David Monteith, the Dean of Leicester Cathedral, has explained the considerable efforts and expenditure invested by the cathedral in order to create a lasting burial place 'as befits an anointed King'. We agree that it is time for Richard III to be given a dignified reburial, and finally laid to rest.' Location: Richard III will finally be laid to rest at Leicester Cathedral after judges said it was time for the monarch to be given a 'dignified burial' Richard was born in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. During the War of the Roses, Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in 1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne. Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king. In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Edward V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate. Richard III took to the throne the following day. He was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes disappeared, Rumours spread the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign. In 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire. Many of Richard III's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII. It has been confirmed that Richard III had a curvature of the spine, although rumours of a withered arm haven't been verified form the bones found in the Leicester car park last year. Last year scientists discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after finding large numbers of the parasite’s eggs in soil taken from Richard III’s pelvic region. The find suggests that the king’s intestines were infected with roundworm during his life. Discovered: The remains of Richard III (pictured) were discovered by archaeologists in a council car park in Leicester. There have been heated discussions as to where the king is to be buried and the high court has now confirmed that he will be laid to rest in Leicester Cathedral .","Golden crown was commissioned by a historian involved in the archaeological dig that recovered Richard III from a Leicester car park .

"By . Helen Nicholson . The construction of Stonehenge has been voted the historical event that most Britons would like to travel back in time to witness. The evacuation of Dunkirk, and the defending of Hadrian’s Wall by the Romans came second and third in the poll conducted by English Heritage. The organisation carried out the survey to celebrate the launch of six weeks of living history events across the country this summer, including medieval jousts, knights and princess training academies, and the chance to meet some of England’s most famous kings and queens. Still a mystery: English Heritage's Jeremy Ashbee said people wanted to discover more about who built the historic stone circle - and why . A total of 2,272 people were quizzed about which iconic historical event they would like to have been present at. The lifting into place of the enormous stones at Stonehenge around 5,000 years ago topped the poll with almost half of those surveyed (47 per cent) wishing they’d been there to see it. The masterminding of the evacuation of British soldiers from the Dunkirk beaches during the Second World War was the next choice (34 per cent), while seeing Roman soldiers patrolling Hadrian’s Wall came third (26 per cent). Going underground: In second place, people wanted to watch the planning of the Dunkirk evacuation during the Second World War from the Secret Wartime Tunnels underneath Dover Castle . Watching Victorian scientist Charles Darwin conduct his revolutionary experiments from his home in Kent (23 per cent) and the first Viking raid at Lindisfarne Priory (18 per cent) were also popular choices at fourth and fifth place respectively. King Harold falling in combat at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 (17 per cent) and Henry V preparing his troops ahead of the battle of Agincourt in France (16 per cent) also made it into the top ten. Added to this, 68 per cent of adults said they wished they knew more about history and 47 per cent said they planned to visit a historic place this summer. Stepping back in time: The defending of Hadrian's Wall by the Romans . came second in the poll, while watching Charles Darwin (right) conducting experiments at Down House came in fourth . Jeremy Ashbee, Head Properties Curator at English Heritage, said: ‘There are so many things we don’t know about Stonehenge and perhaps that’s why it topped our poll, with people wanting to discover more about who built the stone circle, and why. ‘It is great that there is such an appetite for history. While English Heritage can’t literally take people back in time, we can offer the next best thing - the chance to experience those places where history was made. 'Over the six week summer holiday English Heritage will host its biggest ever summer of historical events providing fun, entertaining and inspiring days out for families, culture fans and those keen to find out more about England’s stories.’ Devastating attack: In fifth place was the chance to watch the first Viking raid taking place at Lindisfarne Priory .

"(CNN) -- ""Everyone agrees we need to go forward with the relief well,"" National Incident Commander Thad Allen said Friday of the now-plugged BP gusher in the Gulf, adding that officials are now considering other options in addition to the relief well. Work will resume on a relief well as scientists and BP engineers continue to assess whether a planned ""bottom kill"" is necessary, he said. The BP oil well, which ruptured April 20 after an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, spilled more than 2 million gallons of oil per day into the Gulf of Mexico before being successfully shut. Allen said that pressure tests were finished and that pressure within the wellhead was unchanged. That means there are options about how to handle the well, which has stopped pouring oil into the Gulf, he said. ""We have successfully shut in this well. We have something now that we haven't had before and we have we have -- I wouldn't call it a luxury -- but we have the trade space to consider alternatives under less than a high-pressure situation."" Allen said crews probably did ""too good a job on the top kill."" Cement and mud got into a core area of the well. But Allen said it's not clear how thick the cement layer is, or how vulnerable it might be to pressure inside the well. ""Everyone agrees we need to go forward with the relief well,"" Allen said. ""The relief well will be finished. How it gets finished will be determined on risk mitigation and the way forward is the essence of what is being discussed right now. The relief well will be finished. We will kill the well."" As they await answers about the condition of the well, businesses in the Gulf Coast are hoping high-profile visitors will help boost local economies. President Obama and his wife, Michelle, plan to travel to the region this weekend to support businesses that have been devastated by the oil disaster. One of their daughters, Sasha, will join them for the trip. Their other daughter, Malia, is at a camp and will not make the trip, a senior administration official said. The family will leave Saturday morning for Panama City Beach, Florida. ""Even as the president talks about what our next steps are in our response, obviously part of this will be highlighting the tremendous economic toll that has taken place,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters earlier this week. Visitors spent more than $34 billion in 2008 in congressional districts along the Gulf Coast, sustaining 400,000 jobs. The effects of the oil spill on the region's travel industry could last up to three years and cost up to $22.7 billion, according to an analysis conducted last month by Oxford Economics for the U.S. Travel Association. In preparing the research, Oxford Economics looked at current spending, government models predicting oil flow and the effect of 25 past crises on tourism to develop a model to gauge the Gulf disaster's impact. Case studies of past disasters -- including the SARS respiratory disease outbreak, Hurricane Katrina and the 2004 Asian tsunami -- show that tourism often is affected beyond the disaster area and long after the resolution of the crisis. To mitigate the effects of the disaster, changing perceptions is key. ""The president will meet with those folks and have a chance to update, I think, the region on where we are,"" Gibbs said. ""And I think it will be important for the president to talk about what are the next steps in bringing the region back."" Meanwhile, work is expected to resume Friday on the drilling of a relief well that is intended to give engineers a better look at the core of the well. Pressure tests will help them make a recommendation to former Adm. Thad Allen, the federal government point man on the disaster, on whether a bottom kill is necessary to permanently seal the ruptured deepwater oil well. The well erupted after an April 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon that left 11 dead. A temporary cap contained the spill on July 15, and nearly 3,000 barrels of heavy drilling mud and cement drove the oil back under the ocean floor last week in the static kill process. The well gushed an estimated 53,000 barrels (nearly 2.3 million gallons) of oil per day before it was capped. Since then, fresh, green grass has started growing again in some of the hardest-hit marshes of southern Louisiana, but oil continues to wash ashore in some places. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","NEW: Work on relief well will resume .

"Indeed, closing the gap between what the government spends and what it takes in taxes was the government's main mission.
But it has proved harder than Mr Osborne had hoped. He would blame circumstances beyond his control which - again - threaten to push his targets further back.
His critics on one side would say the initial pace of the cuts are what dragged the recovery down - a self-defeating object.
Critics on the right would say in fact he's lacked the courage to go far enough.
In the febrile atmosphere less than 48 hours before a Budget, there is agreement on one thing - whether  fast or slow, the most straightforward cuts, practically and politically, have gone.
Former head of the Home Civil Service Lord Kerslake, who was until recently one of the most senior officials involved in the hunt for savings, says clearly: ""It's hard to see where the easy choices are now.""
He told me: ""The savings that have to be found will require very substantial changes in the way things are delivered - or, indeed, the offer made.""
In other words, public services will have to be delivered much more cheaply, or the public will have to accept very different levels of provision.
And with Mr Osborne significantly behind on his own original targets from 2010, by accident or design, Lord Kerslake told me: ""We've still got some way to go, no more than half on the numbers.
""The important thing to say is that the second half is much harder because the sense of crisis that drove the savings in the coalition government has ebbed, the wider economy is growing so people can't see a comparable position there and people just get exhausted by the process.
""The easy savings have been done. So where do you go?""
Well, the chancellor is likely to announce further squeezes on welfare spending - the government has already outlined taking another billion out of the budget allocated to disabled people.
There are likely, by 2020, to be cuts of an extra Â£4bn a year by 2020. To raise revenue, there could possibly be a rise in fuel tax - politically difficult but lucrative for the government coffers - maybe hikes in insurance premiums, and what one Tory MP  described as ""nibbles here and there"".
With the European referendum bearing down on Numbers 10 and 11 there is a desire not to stir up too much controversy, not to distract too much from their main task in hand.
But as Lord Kerslake warns, taking anything else out of government budgets that have already been slimmed down is tricky - a task almost bound to cause complaint in itself.","Year after year, Budget after Budget, George Osborne has stood at the despatch box and promised to balance the books."

"(CNN) -- The California Assembly on Thursday passed a bill appropriating $20 million to kidnapping victim Jaycee Dugard to settle her claims against the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, according to the chief clerk's office. The bill passed on a 30-1 vote in the Senate and a 62-0 vote in the Assembly, according to CNN affiliate KCRA. Corrections officials entered into the settlement with Dugard, the station said. Dugard vanished in 1991 at the age of 11. She was found in August 2009, living in a shed in the Antioch, California, backyard of Phillip Garrido, a registered sex offender who had been on parole since January 1988. Investigators say Garrido fathered two children with Dugard during her captivity. He and his wife, Nancy, are charged with 29 felony counts in the case. Both have pleaded not guilty. In a report issued in November, the state inspector general's office found the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation failed to properly keep tabs on Garrido or properly supervise the officers assigned to his case. ""While it is true that Garrido's California parole was never officially violated, our review shows that Garrido committed numerous parole violations and that the department failed to properly supervise Garrido and missed numerous opportunities to discover his victims,"" the report said. Parole officers failed to investigate utility wires running from Garrido's house toward the shed where Dugard was held, to check out the presence of a 12-year-old girl during a visit or to act on information the report said ""clearly"" showed Garrido had violated the terms of his release, the report said. Dugard, who is now 30, her mother and her daughters had filed a claim saying state corrections officials failed to do their jobs, seeking psychological, physical and emotional damages, KCRA said. The settlement process was ""pretty much unprecedented,"" said Jeff Long, spokesman for Assemblyman Felipe Fuentes, who sponsored the bill. The language was inserted into a bill concerning claims against the state. Fuentes is chairman of the Assembly's Appropriations Committee, Long said. Every year as part of the budget process, the chair submits two bills for judgments against the state, Long said. It was decided that this would be the quickest way to get it through the Assembly, he said. Officials thought the state might have a case if it fought Dugard's claim, but it wasn't worth the case going to a jury, Long said. Because the constitutional deadline for an approved state budget has passed and California is in a new fiscal year without a budget, no appropriations can be made without Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's consent. Schwarzenegger has to request the bill be moved to his desk to sign it, Long said. Garrido was paroled in August 1988 after serving 11 years of a federal kidnapping sentence. He also served a five-year term in Nevada for rape charges. The November report from California Inspector-General David Shaw was limited to reviewing the actions of state parole officers in charge of monitoring Garrido from June 1999 until Dugard and her children were discovered. But Garrido was under the supervision of federal parole officers when authorities say he kidnapped Dugard in 1991, and they also ""failed to detect Garrido's criminal conduct and his victims,"" the report says. Garrido was only ""properly supervised"" for 12 out of the 123 months he was under California's supervision, ""a failure rate of about 90 percent,"" Shaw told reporters in November.

"Azelle Rodney, 24, died in 2005 after being shot by a former police officer, known only as E7, as police sought to move in on him over a double stabbing . Firearms officers are threatening industrial action after a former policeman was charged with murdering a drug dealer during a Scotland Yard operation. Armed officers are said to be considering a staged walk-out after it was confirmed that the ex-officer will stand trial over the 2005 death of Azelle Rodney, who died in a hail of bullets when his car was stopped by police marksmen. Rodney, 24, was hit six times, once each in the arm and back, and fatally four times in the head in Edgware, north London. The man accused of murdering him, only the third policeman to be charged with committing murder in the course of his duties, can only be identified as E7 after being granted anonymity during a public inquiry. The secrecy order, made in accordance with Article 8 of the Human Rights Act which grants people the right to a family life, could be lifted when the ex-officer makes his first appearance in court in September. The decision to charge E7 was welcomed by Rodney’s mother, who has campaigned for justice for nearly a decade and may be in line for a huge compensation payout from the Met. But it has left Scotland Yard chiefs worried about possible ‘industrial action’ by some police firearms officers who might lay down their weapons in support of their former colleague. Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the national lead for armed policing, said the move to charge E7 had left officers shocked. He told The Times: ‘Firearms officers volunteer for the role and many are now considering their future career choices. ‘Officers are not above the law and they are accountable for their individual decisions, but carrying a gun on behalf of the state is a big ask and it just got bigger.’ The decision to charge E7 comes after a three-month public inquiry into Rodney’s death, led by former judge Sir Christopher Holland. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said: ‘We have carefully considered the new file of evidence submitted to us and have decided that a former Metropolitan Police officer, currently identified only as E7, will be prosecuted for murder. The individual currently has anonymity.’ The murder suspect will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on September 10. The shooting took place outside The Railway Tavern on . Hale Lane in . Edgware, north London. Forensic experts are pictured at the crime scene after the incident took place in April 2005 . After . the findings of a public inquiry into Mr Rodney's death were published, . his mother Susan . Alexander, pictured middle, called for an investigation to be opened. She is pictured with lawyer Daniel Machover, right and Leslie Thomas, . from Garden Court Chambers, left . Rodney’s mother Susan Alexander said: ‘I am very pleased at the decision to prosecute the officer who killed my son. I have waited a long time to see this day and hope this prosecution will lead to justice for Azelle.’ Rodney was hit by eight shots in less than two seconds from a high-powered carbine at almost point blank range. The rounds were fired from the open window of a patrol car within a split second of pulling alongside the VW Golf carrying Rodney. The murder charge against E7 is . believed to be only the third time in recent years that an officer has . been charged with murder while on active duty. PC . Chris Sherwood from Sussex Police was acquitted of murder in 2001, . after he shot James Ashley, 39, while he was naked and unarmed. The shooting had taken place while police searched his flat in Hastings, East Sussex. The officer said he believed Mr Ashley was mistakenly pointing a gun at him and was about to shoot. The . Chief Constable of Sussex, Martin Richards, who was the nominal . defendant in the civil case that followed, admitted negligence and . agreed to pay the family damages. But the force always strongly denied misconduct. In . an earlier case - and believed to be the first of its kind - . Metropolitan Police PC Patrick Hodgson was cleared at the Old Bailey of . the murder and manslaughter of suspected car thief David Ewin, 38. He stood trial three times after the jury failed to deliver a verdict on the first two occasions. He had always denied both the murder and manslaughter of Mr Ewin in Barnes, south west London, in February 2005. The . officer, then 49, was part of the crew of an armed response vehicle . that had spotted the stolen Toyota sports car parked outside a shop. Mr Ewin died from his injuries after the shooting. Officer E7 claimed he feared Rodney was about to fire a submachine gun. Wesley Lovell and Frank Graham, the other occupants of the VW Golf, were jailed for seven and six years respectively in January 2006 after pleading guilty to possession of firearms. Lovell was also convicted of allowing drug production in his Hammersmith home. In court he claimed that he had let Rodney use his flat as a crack factory to cancel out a drugs debt. At the time of his death Rodney was wanted over a double stabbing in Ealing. There have only been two previous cases where police officers were charged with murder. In 1997 Metropolitan Police PC Patrick Hodgson was cleared of the 1995 murder of suspected car thief David Ewin in Barnes, south-west London. The second related to PC Chris Sherwood, who was accused of murder after he shot suspected drug dealer James Ashley while he was naked and unarmed when officers searched his flat in St Leonards, East Sussex, in 1998. He was cleared in 2001. Leaders of the Police Federation, which represents more than 125,000 rank and file officers, held discussions about firearms officers conducting ‘unofficial strikes’ when marksmen faced the prospect of being charged with murder in two other cases. The shootings of unarmed decorator Harry Stanley in 1999 and Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005 were mired in controversy but possible walkouts were averted when prosecutors ruled out murder charges. E7 has been supported in his legal battle by the Metropolitan branch of the Police Federation, whose chairman John Tully said: ‘Parallels may be drawn with the Harry Stanley case going back a number of years when two officers were arrested. ‘At the time there were concerns about the lack of support from senior management and Government. It’s a very difficult job.’ But he added: ‘I have not detected any similar feelings in the workforce currently. It could have an impact on morale.’ The Police Firearms Officers Association said the case had raised many issues. A spokesman said: ‘The decision by the CPS to prosecute E7 raises many issues around the role of armed policing and officers having confidence in the law should they be involved in a shooting.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","24-year-old died in Edgware, London, in April 2005 after being shot six times .

Marina Moskvicheva, Chelyabinsk health chief, told the Russian news agency Interfax that 985 people in her city asked for medical help and 43 were hospitalized. It was the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century and occurred hours before a 150-foot asteroid passed within about 17,000 miles (28,000 kilometers) of Earth. Planetary scientists said there were no connections between the meteor that passed over Siberia and the larger asteroid. It is unknown if the fireball spotted in California had any connection to the asteroid. Gerald McKeegan, a local astronomer in California, told NBC that based on accounts he believes that the fireball spotted in northern part of the state was a ‘sporadic meteor,’ which he said can happen several times a day. McKeegan said that sporadic meteors bring as much as 15,000 tons of space debris to Earth each year.

A retired watchmaker who set up a cannabis factory in his garage shot a burglar who was trying to break in to his remote farmhouse, a court heard today. Malcolm White, 63, fired at Robert Richards when he caught him trying to smash his living room window in October 2011. The burglar, who fired back at the homeowner before fleeing in a getaway van, was so badly injured when he was arrested that doctors had to amputate his right leg. On trial: Malcolm White, pictured with his partner Josephine Merrick, is accused of shooting a burglar at his home . Break-in: Robert Richards and Darren Randall attempted to burgle the farmhouse in Herefordshire, pictured . But White insists that the shooting was an accident, and has pleaded not guilty to unlawful wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm at Worcester Crown Court. A jury heard that the retiree spent 20 minutes locking up the garage which contained his £18,000 cannabis farm before he reported the attempted break-in at his £420,000 home in Whitborne, Herefordshire by Richards, 30, and Darren Randall, 26. He told officers he believed the robbers had been after his Audi A8 sports car - but failed to inform them he had shot one of the thieves. The jury was told that White had a total of 20 firearms stashed around his home, and boasted to partner Josephine Merrick that he 'shot the bastard' during the botched burglary. Investigation: Police found £18,000 worth of cannabis plants at the house when they searched it . Prosecutor Simon Phillips said that White was 'no ordinary householder' and shot Richards in order to 'protect his turf'. He continued: 'The reality was, Mr White knew this raid was a possibility and took the initiative to shoot Mr Richards before he knew it. 'He was protecting his turf and was prepared with a number of firearms around his property. 'In Mr White's garage was a valuable and extensive crop of cannabis. He was somebody who had something to protect.' The barrister told the court that the couple's home was 'set apart from other houses', making it easier for White to conceal his drug farm, for which he had bought £20,000 worth of equipment. When police searched the garage they seized 60 plants worth up to £18,000 but capable of producing £60,000 of cannabis a year. Haul: A police officer is pictured taking cannabis plants away from White's garage . Case: Ms Merrick was sentenced to unpaid work over the cannabis factory at her home .

"Mansfield District Council debated the £250m Lindhurst scheme, which faced more than 140 objections.
It includes up to 1,700 homes, as well as a new primary school, cemetery, community centre and park on the southern edge of the town.
The planning committee voted five in favour, five against, with the chairman having the casting vote in favour.
Protesters at the meeting shouted ""shame"" as the decision was made.
The 169 hectare (417 acre) application is the largest ever submitted to the council.
Developers, the Lindhurst Group, said it would bring major benefits to the local economy, including up to 4,000 jobs.
Project co-ordinator, Richard Bowden, said: ""We are relieved. We now have a major responsibility to deliver the jobs promised.
""For a development of the size and momentum that is going to be needed to turn Mansfield around, there was no alternative.
""We just hope that now we have the planning consent, people will look at the merits of what we are doing - at the enormous amounts of money that will be coming into the Mansfield economy.""
But objections included concern from Nottingham Wildlife Trust and the Ramblers Association over the loss of countryside and habitat.
Independent Mansfield councillor Andrew Tristram, who opposed the plans, said concerns over congestion and the ability to deliver the promised benefits remained.
""Given the fact the decision was controversial and decided on a casting vote, and also the reasons for departing from the local plan were tenuous, I'm sure local residents would like to see the secretary of state call the decision in,"" he said.",Plans for a major development of houses and businesses in a Nottinghamshire town have been narrowly approved.
"It’s been nearly three months since a photograph of Kathy Griffin posing with a replica of President Donald Trump‘s bloodied, decapitated head in her hand sparked nationwide outrage — and changed her life forever. 
  
 In an in-depth interview with New York magazine’s The Cut, the comedian — who, in the wake of the scandal, was fired from the CNN New Year’s Eve broadcast that she had co-hosted with Anderson Cooper for 10 years — discussed the controversial photo at length, revealing that it was the catalyst that ultimately ended her nearly two decade-long friendship with Cooper. 
  
 When the photo surfaced on May 30, the CNN anchor took to Twitter to condemn it: “For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in,” he wrote. “It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.”

 According to Griffin, in the following days, four of Cooper’s CNN colleagues reached out repeatedly to check on her and offer private support. Cooper, however, didn’t contact Griffin until Aug. 10, The Cut confirmed with CNN. 
  
 On July 26, when asked about his relationship with Griffin on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Cooper said that the two were still friends.

 “Yeah, we’re still friends,” he said. “And look, I said what I said about — I didn’t think what she said was appropriate, but I wish her the best and I hope she bounces back. She’s incredibly funny and a lot of people love her and I think she’ll bounce back from this.” 
  
 Cooper had previously made similar statements during an appearance at Arizona’s Comerica Theatre on June 11: “I don’t want anybody’s career to be destroyed because they do something unfortunate and inappropriate,” he said at the time. “Look, I wish her well and I hope she bounces back and keeps doing what she does best, which is make people laugh.” 
  
 “CNN made the decision not to bring her back,” he added. “I had nothing to do with it, but I certainly understand why they made that decision.” 
  
 Griffin, 56, told the magazine that the fact that Cooper was publicly claiming they were friends while not checking in with her hurt deeply. When he finally reached out to her in a series of text messages, she told him their friendship was over. 
  
 A source close to Cooper, 50, told the magazine that Cooper was “shocked and upset by the photo, and while he was not ready to talk to her personally about it, he still considered her to be a friend, and was publicly supportive when asked about the controversy.”

 According to Griffin, other celebrities were more solicitous in the aftermath, such as Jerry Seinfeld and Jamie Foxx, who both spoke publicly in support of the comedian. According to Griffin, Amy Schumer personally sent her a funny video and former Today show host Billy Bush — who was notoriously caught up in his own Trump-related scandal — reportedly suggested in a note that Griffin stay quiet for a while and take up meditation. 
  
 Despite the far-reaching consequences of the photo, Griffin told The Cut she’s tired of apologizing for it.

 “Why are people still expecting me to apologize and grovel to a man that tweets like this?” she said. “I’m a comedian; he’s our f—ing president.” 
  
 “President Trump just pardoned Joe Arpaio, who was essentially running a concentration camp in the Arizona desert,” she later added. “He said there are some good Nazis, and he’s kicking out young adults who were brought here as kids by their parents, and I’m the one who has to continue to apologize?” ||||| Kathy Griffin walked into her home office just before noon in late June, still wearing pajamas. The comedian, who regularly stays up late, had just woken up to news of President Trump’s latest Twitter tear. Trump had covered a wide range of topics in a series of tweets, from denouncing Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the election to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer — or, as Trump called him in a tweet that morning, “Cryin’ Chuck.” 
  
 “Why are people still expecting me to apologize and grovel to a man that tweets like this?” Griffin vented to me. “I’m a comedian; he’s our fucking president.” 
  
 It had been 23 days since a photograph of Griffin holding a Donald Trump mask covered in fake blood completely altered her life. Cooked up as satire in a single afternoon, it first appeared on TMZ and then spread across social media rapidly, uniting Republicans and Democrats in outrage. Griffin released a video apology almost immediately after the photo’s release, but the damage was done; the next day, Trump intensified the backlash by tweeting a claim that his son Barron, 11, was having a difficult time dealing with the image. And members of the First Family, including Trump’s two older sons, launched an aggressive public campaign against Griffin. 
  
 In the following days, the Secret Service opened an investigation; Griffin was fired from the CNN New Year’s Eve broadcast that she had co-hosted with Anderson Cooper for ten years; a lucrative endorsement contract was canceled, and so were 15 scheduled live performances, owing to bomb threats, which she estimates cost her more than a million dollars. Thousands of death threats rolled in, some of her close friends abandoned her, and even her beloved Fox News–loving mother, Maggie Griffin, joked to her daughter that she would not have her support. 
  
 A carefully choreographed apology tour might have helped Griffin move past the controversy — the video she filmed the day the photo was released felt hasty, and a defensive press conference a few days later was widely criticized after Griffin (who had, after all, fired the first salvo against Trump) presented herself as a victim. But moving on doesn’t seem to be on Griffin’s mind: The short promotional video she just released for her new Laugh Your Head Off tour of Europe, Australia, and New Zealand concludes with an image of her in the same blouse she wore in the infamous Trump photo, holding a globe in her hand instead of a Trump mask. And she’s still angry with the president. 
  
 “President Trump just pardoned Joe Arpaio, who was essentially running a concentration camp in the Arizona desert,” she tells me over the phone this past weekend. “He said there are some good Nazis, and he’s kicking out young adults who were brought here as kids by their parents, and I’m the one who has to continue to apologize?” 
  
 Between these two conversations, I visited Griffin at her home in Los Angeles a number of times (we first met a dozen years ago at a party; in the last year, after she reached out to me via Twitter DM, we began discussing politics regularly). She paid $10.5 million last year for a 13,000-square-foot mansion with all the trappings; her next-door neighbors are Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. “I’ve moved in next door to my act!” she tells me. (She says they’re excellent neighbors and don’t make any noise. When I was with Griffin, Kardashian sent her a text message to see how she was feeling.) 
  
 Griffin, who made her career by mocking celebrities, is not the most likely comedian to be martyred over the inalienable right to criticize the president. But in the past couple of years, her act has become more and more political. She says that has led some of her fans to bristle. “Comedians talk about what their audience is faced with every day, we try to relate to our audience,” she says. “I’m obsessed with politics. I always have been, and now, with Trump, many people are obsessed with politics, so that’s going to be a big part of my act.” 
  
 In the course of our talks, the theme she returned to most forcefully was the right to provoke with humor. Griffin describes a visit to an LGBT center in Los Angeles, during which an AIDS patient asked her to mock him so he could feel normal, as a defining moment in her career, and an example of the value of seemingly outrageous comedy. “I would be abandoning my principles as a comic and a human being if I backed off President Trump or any public person,” she tells me. “Comics by their nature are anti-Establishment. They are charged with the often unenviable task of going after people in power. I will never abdicate that responsibility.” 
  
 Griffin fears the impact of what happened to her will resonate further. “When the president tweeted about me the morning after I released the image, it served as an executive order of sorts to his family and supporters to go after me,” she says. “You may say I deserved it, but just think about it … the president of the United States and his family are going after a stand-up comic who had a show on the Bravo network called My Life on the D-List. If that isn’t punching down, I don’t know what is.” 
  
 Griffin says she isn’t a victim: “I am in a position of privilege, I will be fine,” she says. “But what about any American citizen, whether they’re artists or not, who innocently post a shocking photo on social media — will they face a federal investigation?” Griffin also worries about the “chilling effect” created by the retribution wielded by a vengeful president and his army of supporters. She thinks that just as she’s taken responsibility for her provocative image, Trump “has to take responsibility for the power he holds with his Twitter account.” 
  
 Even if one agrees with Griffin’s sentiments, it’s fair to wonder what the image of Trump’s severed head signified beyond the obvious interpretation, and whether Griffin should have realized how much blowback it would create, given the hyperpolarized media environment that surrounds the president. 
  
 Rick Wilson, a longtime Republican political consultant who denounced Trump early and hasn’t wavered since, says he found Griffin’s image “way outside the boundaries and unhelpful against the cause. I understand how strong passions against Trump run, mine do very frequently, but people are always looking for reasons to delegitimize you.” Charlie Sykes, a conservative political commentator and former radio host who is famously anti-Trump, tells me that Griffin gave Trump and his supporters a big gift by releasing the image. “The moment I saw the picture, I knew [the outcry from Trump and his supporters] was going to happen. It’s a useful meme for Trump: It’s the left that incites violence, it’s the left that engages in hate.”

 The photos were improvised in an afternoon: Tyler Shields, a celebrity photographer known for his provocative images (he once shot an image of a black man hanging a member of the KKK), was taking some updated portraits of Griffin, and afterward, they decided to create some spoof images involving Trump. Griffin dispatched her assistant to find a Trump mask and a friend made fake blood using ketchup. They wanted to comment on Trump’s infamous comments about Megyn Kelly — “blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever” — after she questioned him about his history of sexist comments in the first Republican presidential debate in 2015. 
  
 With Griffin’s permission, Shields (who did not respond to requests for comment) released the image — although he didn’t tell her where it would go first. Shields, according to Griffin, chose to give it to TMZ, and the Trump-friendly tabloid’s framing — “Kathy Griffin wants Donald Trump’s head … but she wants it bloody and detached from his body” — didn’t ponder any deeper meanings. Griffin, perhaps naively, assumed that no one would ever think she actually wants to kill anyone, much less the president of the United States. But that’s exactly what some people thought. 
  
 Chelsea Clinton tweeted, “This is vile and wrong. It is never funny to joke about killing a president.” Will & Grace star Debra Messing, who regularly tweets about her distaste for Trump, tweeted, “It wasn’t right when peoplel [sic] hung lynched Obama effigies, just as what Kathy Griffin did isn’t right now.” 
  
 When I first saw the photo on Twitter, I assumed it was a private, unfortunate gag that had leaked somehow. (Despite Griffin’s reputation as a shock comic, she is also an astute manager of her image and her act who keeps a First Amendment attorney on retainer.) 
  
 I called Griffin as the heat was building, but at that point she wasn’t at all concerned. Her first question was, “Oh, is it getting around?” I discouraged her from posting the photo on her own accounts, which have millions of followers, but there was no stopping her — she told me that she was well-versed in dealing with controversy. After it became clear that Griffin stood behind the image, a brewing controversy turned into a full-on firestorm. Three hours later, I got an Instagram alert on my phone: Griffin had posted her apology video. 
  
 It was a call from Rosie O’Donnell that made Griffin realize the mistake she had made. O’Donnell arguably has had more ire directed at her from Trump than any other celebrity, but she confirmed to me that she asked Griffin a simple question: “What is James Foley’s mom going to think when she sees this?” Foley, an American journalist, was beheaded by ISIS in 2014 while on assignment in Syria. 
  
 Griffin’s apology appeared to satiate her liberal fan base, but Republicans continued to be outraged. Her hope was that things would calm down over the next few days and she could try to return to normal life. But they didn’t. The next morning, as many expected, Trump tweeted about the incident: “Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!” 
  
 The First Lady, Melania Trump, released a statement questioning Griffin’s mental health saying, “[A] photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.” The reaction from Trump’s sons and daughter-in-law was even more aggressive. Donald Trump Jr. tweeted repeatedly about Griffin and even tweeted at CNN anchor Jake Tapper asking him if Griffin would be fired. Lara Trump, who is married to Trump’s son Eric, appeared on Sean Hannity’s program on Fox News to denounce Griffin. (The White House declined multiple requests to comment on this story.) 
  
 It’s hard to imagine any other U.S. president, much less his family, going after any entertainer the way Trump and his family went after Griffin. Wilson told me that he finds it ironic that Trump, who rode into the White House on a platform of decrying political correctness, has presided over the development of a “highly refined outrage culture, particularly around himself. There is no humor. He and his supporters will go to DEFCON 1 if they sense there’s something that offends him.” Wilson added that he has also dealt with death threats and loss of business because of his commentary about Trump. 
  
 Sykes and Wilson both tell me they refuse to accept that Trump was truly offended by Griffin’s image. On June 23, it was revealed that Al Baldasaro, a member of New Hampshire’s House of Representatives and a top Trump supporter, was a guest of Trump’s at a bill-signing at the White House. During the 2016 campaign, Baldasaro said on two occasions that Hillary Clinton should have been shot by a firing squad. 
  
 As the photo spread around the internet, Griffin’s social media was flooded with detailed and gruesome death threats. The agency that represented Griffin for television work had to shut down their switchboard because they were flooded with angry calls. In the week after, she received death threats via mail — some of the messages, which I reviewed, were stunning and frightening in their specificity. 
  
 Fox News featured the Griffin controversy throughout their programming, and their opinion hosts talked about it length. While many news programs have blurred the image of Trump’s head, Hannity showed it in its original form repeatedly over the past 89 days, even though he claims that the image could incite violence against Trump. A Fox News spokeswoman declined an interview on Hannity’s behalf. 
  
 There’s a chance that Griffin could have recovered from the controversy much sooner, had she not made the fateful decision to hold a press conference with her newly retained attorney Lisa Bloom just three days after the photo was released. Bloom, known as an attorney who specializes in women’s advocacy, is a ubiquitous presence on cable television whose fame has increased as she has been retained by clients who have accused President Trump and former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly of sexual assault and harassment, respectively. 
  
 Before the press conference, Griffin received text messages and emails from friends, begging her not to go through with it; they felt it would only further inflame the situation. But Griffin felt that she would look erratic if she canceled, and she was also feeling wounded by all the attacks. It was a disaster: Griffin appeared defensive and nervous instead of resolute. She talked as if she had been the victim of an unprovoked attack. “None of the points I wanted to make in that press conference came across because I said I was a victim and acted like a victim. I take responsibility for that,” she says. 
  
 In the aftermath, Griffin says she couldn’t even find a reputable crisis-management expert to take her on as a client, and she still hasn’t found a publicist. Entreaties from her team are met with responses like, “We aren’t taking on new clients right now” — Hollywood speak for “we don’t want you.” Griffin decided to leave WME, the agency that has represented her for television projects, but she is staying with her longtime concert agent at ICM. 
  
 Meanwhile, other stars who’ve made statements that have landed them in the crosshairs of the Secret Service — like Johnny Depp, who made a Trump assassination joke on camera — have seen the ensuing controversy swiftly go away (it helps that Trump didn’t tweet about Depp). 
  
 For the past two and a half months, Griffin, who says she traveled to 80 cities last year as part of her comedy concert tour, has been in hibernation. She’s gone to five social functions and a few business meetings. In July, Griffin’s sister Joyce was diagnosed with cancer and Griffin shaved her head in solidarity. The thousands of death threats have trickled to mere hundreds. The Secret Service investigation, after an hour-long interview, remained open for two months, stoking Griffin’s fear that somehow the levers of government power might be used against her, until her lawyer was finally informed that the inquiry had closed. 
  
 In the past few years, Griffin, who has always been a political junkie, has contributed thousands of dollars to elected officials like Barack Obama and Minnesota senator Al Franken, according to federal records. She co-hosted a town hall with California congressman Ted Lieu, and she’s appeared regularly on MSNBC to talk about LGBT and women’s advocacy. Griffin says she was supposed to host a fundraiser for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at her home the week after the photo was released. In July, she adds, she was slated to speak at Politicon, a convention of political and media leaders from both parties, in Pasadena, California. All of that went away almost immediately. Franken admonished her publicly and Pelosi’s office canceled the fundraiser. 
  
 But getting fired by CNN was the most public indignity for Griffin because it involved business and personal relationships that had been fraught with tension for years. Griffin credits CNN president Jeff Zucker with reinvigorating her career in 2003 when she was doing stand-up at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. According to EW, Zucker, then president of NBC Entertainment, came to see her act and they eventually struck a deal for Griffin to have her own reality show on the NBC-owned Bravo Network called My Life on the D-List. 
  
 But since Zucker became CNN chief, he and Griffin had clashed regularly, she says. New Year’s Eve is a big money-making opportunity for entertainers, and the CNN gig didn’t pay very well. In 2015, Griffin says she called Zucker directly to see if he could bump up her compensation. The broadcast was receiving record ratings, Griffin was doing a lot of the work as the comedian to Cooper’s straight man, and the broadcast had gone from 90 minutes to four-and-a-half hours since she started doing it. 
  
 Griffin says Zucker was livid and told her that he could get comedian Samantha Bee to take her place. Zucker, Griffin says, called her agent and publicist to say she was fired. They eventually made up, but not before Zucker cut Griffin’s pay (she did get a raise in 2016). 
  
 Griffin also says that before the 2017 broadcast, Zucker called her at home to tell her she could only do four jokes about Trump (the first time there had ever been limits on her material during the special). When Griffin pushed back, she says Zucker said to her, “I don’t need this, you don’t need this. He’s come after me harder than anybody. I have to deal with this guy.” Griffin reluctantly agreed to the limit. Zucker, through a CNN spokeswoman, declined to comment. 
  
 Griffin’s best-known celebrity friendship, going back 17 years, is with CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. But after TMZ published the photo, Cooper came under tremendous pressure to repudiate it. Without reaching out to Griffin, he tweeted the same night: “For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.” Griffin acknowledges that Cooper was in an untenable position, but she feels that their long friendship afforded her a call or text message beforehand. 
  
 In the following days, Griffin says four of Cooper’s CNN colleagues reached out repeatedly to Griffin to check on her and offer private support (I independently confirmed this). But Cooper didn’t contact Griffin until August 10, CNN confirmed to me. 
  
 On July 26, when asked about Griffin on Andy Cohen’s talk show, Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Cooper claimed that Griffin was still a friend. “Yeah, we’re still friends, and look I said what I said about — I didn’t think what she said was appropriate, but I wish her the best and I hope she bounces back,” he told Cohen. 
  
 The fact that Cooper was telling people publicly they were friends, while not checking in with her, hurt Griffin deeply. When he finally reached out to her in a series of text messages, she told him their friendship was over. 
  
 A source close to Cooper tells me that Cooper was “shocked and upset by the photo, and while he was not ready to talk to her personally about it, he still considered her to be a friend, and was publicly supportive when asked about the controversy.” 
  
 Other celebrities were more solicitous. Advice and support flooded in from Hollywood friends, actors, and comics. One critically revered comedian, Griffin says, reassured her that her career wasn’t over and that every comic would give their right arm for the act she’d have after the controversy died down. A comedic movie legend said the incident would be a landmark in the way comedy is viewed. Jerry Seinfeld and Jamie Foxx made supportive comments publicly. Amy Schumer sent Griffin a funny video that Griffin played for me but declined to let me describe. When a couple who live in her gated community, but whom Griffin had never known or met, dropped off a cake and a note, Griffin was so touched that she broke down crying in her bed. 
  
 Despite all the private support, no entertainers were willing to speak to me on the record about Griffin. For this story, I reached out to a number of celebrities, especially comics, that Griffin is close friends with. They’ve been calling and texting Griffin in the past few months to check in on her. A few of them even initially told me that they would talk to me for this story, but when I reached out to their publicists to set up phone interviews, I was politely turned away. 
  
 There was also some unsolicited advice. An iconic actress told Griffin to stay at home and out of the limelight until Trump was impeached (it’s unclear when the actress thought that would happen). Former Today show host Billy Bush, who knows what getting caught up in a Trump-related scandal is like, suggested, in a note Griffin shared with me, that she stay quiet for a while and take up meditation. 
  
 The most disturbing advice came via email from a member of the board of directors of the CBS Corporation, Arnold Kopelson, an Academy Award–winning producer who Griffin used to consider a friend. Kopelson emailed Griffin with a prewritten letter to President Trump that he said she should mail to him, and which Griffin shared with me. 
  
 The letter includes phrases like, “Now with my world crumbling around me, I am listening for the first time about the great things you have done and are doing. How stupid I was to follow the lies from the ‘Left.’ It took my terrible mistake to finally see the false news,” and “I do not deserve what I am asking of you. I am begging you to open your heart and forgive me.” Kopelson said that Griffin should “exclusively release the letter to Fox Broadcasting,” adding, “Do not send to the other networks.” “If you don’t do exactly what I’ve written, your career is over,” Kopelson wrote. A spokesman for CBS Corporation declined to comment. When I called Kopelson for comment, he said, “I’m tied up” as soon as I explained the reason for the call, and hung up the phone. Kopelson did not respond to a request for comment via email. 
  
 Griffin tells me that Kopelson’s email was indicative of “men who control the checkbooks,” who, despite the entertainment industry’s liberal reputation, tend to be more conservative and don’t like people who rock the boat. She acknowledged that revealing details about people like Kopelson, Cooper, and Zucker is unusual, and could harm her future employment prospects. 
  
 But Griffin occupies an unusual space in comedy: Like her late friend and mentor Joan Rivers, she has constantly struggled to be taken seriously, but managed to build a substantial fan base that has enriched her and made her very famous. Her concert agent showed me Ticketmaster data indicating that over the past 13 years, Griffin has sold over 1.2 million tickets to her shows. 
  
 Griffin says she wants to focus on First Amendment issues now. She’s hoping to organize a First Amendment concert with the ACLU, and she’s working on a documentary film of her upcoming international tour, as well as a docu-series, although none of these projects has come to fruition yet. 
  
 In the meantime, although she’s still too worried about her physical safety to tour America, Griffin is off around the world. Her act will feature plenty of Trump jokes, despite the fact that some of her friends have suggested she take it easy on the president for a while. 
  
 Rick Wilson thinks she has no alternative. “The way Trump wins is if he shuts people up permanently and scares them off from being vocal critics,” he said. “She has to go back to war.”

 In the course of our talks, the theme she returned to most forcefully was the right to provoke with humor. Griffin describes a visit to an LGBT center in Los Angeles, during which an AIDS patient asked her to mock him so he could feel normal, as a defining moment in her career, and an example of the value of seemingly outrageous comedy. “I would be abandoning my principles as a comic and a human being if I backed off President Trump or any public person,” she tells me. “Comics by their nature are anti-Establishment. They are charged with the often unenviable task of going after people in power. I will never abdicate that responsibility.” 
  
 Griffin fears the impact of what happened to her will resonate further. “When the president tweeted about me the morning after I released the image, it served as an executive order of sorts to his family and supporters to go after me,” she says. “You may say I deserved it, but just think about it … the president of the United States and his family are going after a stand-up comic who had a show on the Bravo network called My Life on the D-List. If that isn’t punching down, I don’t know what is.” 
  
 Griffin says she isn’t a victim: “I am in a position of privilege, I will be fine,” she says. “But what about any American citizen, whether they’re artists or not, who innocently post a shocking photo on social media — will they face a federal investigation?” Griffin also worries about the “chilling effect” created by the retribution wielded by a vengeful president and his army of supporters. She thinks that just as she’s taken responsibility for her provocative image, Trump “has to take responsibility for the power he holds with his Twitter account.” 
  
 Even if one agrees with Griffin’s sentiments, it’s fair to wonder what the image of Trump’s severed head signified beyond the obvious interpretation, and whether Griffin should have realized how much blowback it would create, given the hyperpolarized media environment that surrounds the president. 
  
 Rick Wilson, a longtime Republican political consultant who denounced Trump early and hasn’t wavered since, says he found Griffin’s image “way outside the boundaries and unhelpful against the cause. I understand how strong passions against Trump run, mine do very frequently, but people are always looking for reasons to delegitimize you.” Charlie Sykes, a conservative political commentator and former radio host who is famously anti-Trump, tells me that Griffin gave Trump and his supporters a big gift by releasing the image. “The moment I saw the picture, I knew [the outcry from Trump and his supporters] was going to happen. It’s a useful meme for Trump: It’s the left that incites violence, it’s the left that engages in hate.”

 The photos were improvised in an afternoon: Tyler Shields, a celebrity photographer known for his provocative images (he once shot an image of a black man hanging a member of the KKK), was taking some updated portraits of Griffin, and afterward, they decided to create some spoof images involving Trump. Griffin dispatched her assistant to find a Trump mask and a friend made fake blood using ketchup. They wanted to comment on Trump’s infamous comments about Megyn Kelly — “blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever” — after she questioned him about his history of sexist comments in the first Republican presidential debate in 2015. 
  
 With Griffin’s permission, Shields (who did not respond to requests for comment) released the image — although he didn’t tell her where it would go first. Shields, according to Griffin, chose to give it to TMZ, and the Trump-friendly tabloid’s framing — “Kathy Griffin wants Donald Trump’s head … but she wants it bloody and detached from his body” — didn’t ponder any deeper meanings. Griffin, perhaps naively, assumed that no one would ever think she actually wants to kill anyone, much less the president of the United States. But that’s exactly what some people thought. 
  
 Chelsea Clinton tweeted, “This is vile and wrong. It is never funny to joke about killing a president.” Will & Grace star Debra Messing, who regularly tweets about her distaste for Trump, tweeted, “It wasn’t right when peoplel [sic] hung lynched Obama effigies, just as what Kathy Griffin did isn’t right now.” 
  
 When I first saw the photo on Twitter, I assumed it was a private, unfortunate gag that had leaked somehow. (Despite Griffin’s reputation as a shock comic, she is also an astute manager of her image and her act who keeps a First Amendment attorney on retainer.) 
  
 I called Griffin as the heat was building, but at that point she wasn’t at all concerned. Her first question was, “Oh, is it getting around?” I discouraged her from posting the photo on her own accounts, which have millions of followers, but there was no stopping her — she told me that she was well-versed in dealing with controversy. After it became clear that Griffin stood behind the image, a brewing controversy turned into a full-on firestorm. Three hours later, I got an Instagram alert on my phone: Griffin had posted her apology video. 
  
 It was a call from Rosie O’Donnell that made Griffin realize the mistake she had made. O’Donnell arguably has had more ire directed at her from Trump than any other celebrity, but she confirmed to me that she asked Griffin a simple question: “What is James Foley’s mom going to think when she sees this?” Foley, an American journalist, was beheaded by ISIS in 2014 while on assignment in Syria. 
  
 Griffin’s apology appeared to satiate her liberal fan base, but Republicans continued to be outraged. Her hope was that things would calm down over the next few days and she could try to return to normal life. But they didn’t. The next morning, as many expected, Trump tweeted about the incident: “Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!” 
  
 The First Lady, Melania Trump, released a statement questioning Griffin’s mental health saying, “[A] photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.” The reaction from Trump’s sons and daughter-in-law was even more aggressive. Donald Trump Jr. tweeted repeatedly about Griffin and even tweeted at CNN anchor Jake Tapper asking him if Griffin would be fired. Lara Trump, who is married to Trump’s son Eric, appeared on Sean Hannity’s program on Fox News to denounce Griffin. (The White House declined multiple requests to comment on this story.) 
  
 It’s hard to imagine any other U.S. president, much less his family, going after any entertainer the way Trump and his family went after Griffin. Wilson told me that he finds it ironic that Trump, who rode into the White House on a platform of decrying political correctness, has presided over the development of a “highly refined outrage culture, particularly around himself. There is no humor. He and his supporters will go to DEFCON 1 if they sense there’s something that offends him.” Wilson added that he has also dealt with death threats and loss of business because of his commentary about Trump. 
  
 Sykes and Wilson both tell me they refuse to accept that Trump was truly offended by Griffin’s image. On June 23, it was revealed that Al Baldasaro, a member of New Hampshire’s House of Representatives and a top Trump supporter, was a guest of Trump’s at a bill-signing at the White House. During the 2016 campaign, Baldasaro said on two occasions that Hillary Clinton should have been shot by a firing squad. 
  
 As the photo spread around the internet, Griffin’s social media was flooded with detailed and gruesome death threats. The agency that represented Griffin for television work had to shut down their switchboard because they were flooded with angry calls. In the week after, she received death threats via mail — some of the messages, which I reviewed, were stunning and frightening in their specificity. 
  
 Fox News featured the Griffin controversy throughout their programming, and their opinion hosts talked about it length. While many news programs have blurred the image of Trump’s head, Hannity showed it in its original form repeatedly over the past 89 days, even though he claims that the image could incite violence against Trump. A Fox News spokeswoman declined an interview on Hannity’s behalf. 
  
 There’s a chance that Griffin could have recovered from the controversy much sooner, had she not made the fateful decision to hold a press conference with her newly retained attorney Lisa Bloom just three days after the photo was released. Bloom, known as an attorney who specializes in women’s advocacy, is a ubiquitous presence on cable television whose fame has increased as she has been retained by clients who have accused President Trump and former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly of sexual assault and harassment, respectively. 
  
 Before the press conference, Griffin received text messages and emails from friends, begging her not to go through with it; they felt it would only further inflame the situation. But Griffin felt that she would look erratic if she canceled, and she was also feeling wounded by all the attacks. It was a disaster: Griffin appeared defensive and nervous instead of resolute. She talked as if she had been the victim of an unprovoked attack. “None of the points I wanted to make in that press conference came across because I said I was a victim and acted like a victim. I take responsibility for that,” she says. 
  
 In the aftermath, Griffin says she couldn’t even find a reputable crisis-management expert to take her on as a client, and she still hasn’t found a publicist. Entreaties from her team are met with responses like, “We aren’t taking on new clients right now” — Hollywood speak for “we don’t want you.” Griffin decided to leave WME, the agency that has represented her for television projects, but she is staying with her longtime concert agent at ICM. 
  
 Meanwhile, other stars who’ve made statements that have landed them in the crosshairs of the Secret Service — like Johnny Depp, who made a Trump assassination joke on camera — have seen the ensuing controversy swiftly go away (it helps that Trump didn’t tweet about Depp). 
  
 For the past two and a half months, Griffin, who says she traveled to 80 cities last year as part of her comedy concert tour, has been in hibernation. She’s gone to five social functions and a few business meetings. In July, Griffin’s sister Joyce was diagnosed with cancer and Griffin shaved her head in solidarity. The thousands of death threats have trickled to mere hundreds. The Secret Service investigation, after an hour-long interview, remained open for two months, stoking Griffin’s fear that somehow the levers of government power might be used against her, until her lawyer was finally informed that the inquiry had closed. 
  
 In the past few years, Griffin, who has always been a political junkie, has contributed thousands of dollars to elected officials like Barack Obama and Minnesota senator Al Franken, according to federal records. She co-hosted a town hall with California congressman Ted Lieu, and she’s appeared regularly on MSNBC to talk about LGBT and women’s advocacy. Griffin says she was supposed to host a fundraiser for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at her home the week after the photo was released. In July, she adds, she was slated to speak at Politicon, a convention of political and media leaders from both parties, in Pasadena, California. All of that went away almost immediately. Franken admonished her publicly and Pelosi’s office canceled the fundraiser. 
  
 But getting fired by CNN was the most public indignity for Griffin because it involved business and personal relationships that had been fraught with tension for years. Griffin credits CNN president Jeff Zucker with reinvigorating her career in 2003 when she was doing stand-up at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. According to EW, Zucker, then president of NBC Entertainment, came to see her act and they eventually struck a deal for Griffin to have her own reality show on the NBC-owned Bravo Network called My Life on the D-List. 
  
 But since Zucker became CNN chief, he and Griffin had clashed regularly, she says. New Year’s Eve is a big money-making opportunity for entertainers, and the CNN gig didn’t pay very well. In 2015, Griffin says she called Zucker directly to see if he could bump up her compensation. The broadcast was receiving record ratings, Griffin was doing a lot of the work as the comedian to Cooper’s straight man, and the broadcast had gone from 90 minutes to four-and-a-half hours since she started doing it. 
  
 Griffin says Zucker was livid and told her that he could get comedian Samantha Bee to take her place. Zucker, Griffin says, called her agent and publicist to say she was fired. They eventually made up, but not before Zucker cut Griffin’s pay (she did get a raise in 2016). 
  
 Griffin also says that before the 2017 broadcast, Zucker called her at home to tell her she could only do four jokes about Trump (the first time there had ever been limits on her material during the special). When Griffin pushed back, she says Zucker said to her, “I don’t need this, you don’t need this. He’s come after me harder than anybody. I have to deal with this guy.” Griffin reluctantly agreed to the limit. Zucker, through a CNN spokeswoman, declined to comment. 
  
 Griffin’s best-known celebrity friendship, going back 17 years, is with CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. But after TMZ published the photo, Cooper came under tremendous pressure to repudiate it. Without reaching out to Griffin, he tweeted the same night: “For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.” Griffin acknowledges that Cooper was in an untenable position, but she feels that their long friendship afforded her a call or text message beforehand. 
  
 In the following days, Griffin says four of Cooper’s CNN colleagues reached out repeatedly to Griffin to check on her and offer private support (I independently confirmed this). But Cooper didn’t contact Griffin until August 10, CNN confirmed to me. 
  
 On July 26, when asked about Griffin on Andy Cohen’s talk show, Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Cooper claimed that Griffin was still a friend. “Yeah, we’re still friends, and look I said what I said about — I didn’t think what she said was appropriate, but I wish her the best and I hope she bounces back,” he told Cohen. 
  
 The fact that Cooper was telling people publicly they were friends, while not checking in with her, hurt Griffin deeply. When he finally reached out to her in a series of text messages, she told him their friendship was over. 
  
 A source close to Cooper tells me that Cooper was “shocked and upset by the photo, and while he was not ready to talk to her personally about it, he still considered her to be a friend, and was publicly supportive when asked about the controversy.” 
  
 Other celebrities were more solicitous. Advice and support flooded in from Hollywood friends, actors, and comics. One critically revered comedian, Griffin says, reassured her that her career wasn’t over and that every comic would give their right arm for the act she’d have after the controversy died down. A comedic movie legend said the incident would be a landmark in the way comedy is viewed. Jerry Seinfeld and Jamie Foxx made supportive comments publicly. Amy Schumer sent Griffin a funny video that Griffin played for me but declined to let me describe. When a couple who live in her gated community, but whom Griffin had never known or met, dropped off a cake and a note, Griffin was so touched that she broke down crying in her bed. 
  
 Despite all the private support, no entertainers were willing to speak to me on the record about Griffin. For this story, I reached out to a number of celebrities, especially comics, that Griffin is close friends with. They’ve been calling and texting Griffin in the past few months to check in on her. A few of them even initially told me that they would talk to me for this story, but when I reached out to their publicists to set up phone interviews, I was politely turned away. 
  
 There was also some unsolicited advice. An iconic actress told Griffin to stay at home and out of the limelight until Trump was impeached (it’s unclear when the actress thought that would happen). Former Today show host Billy Bush, who knows what getting caught up in a Trump-related scandal is like, suggested, in a note Griffin shared with me, that she stay quiet for a while and take up meditation. 
  
 The most disturbing advice came via email from a member of the board of directors of the CBS Corporation, Arnold Kopelson, an Academy Award–winning producer who Griffin used to consider a friend. Kopelson emailed Griffin with a prewritten letter to President Trump that he said she should mail to him, and which Griffin shared with me. 
  
 The letter includes phrases like, “Now with my world crumbling around me, I am listening for the first time about the great things you have done and are doing. How stupid I was to follow the lies from the ‘Left.’ It took my terrible mistake to finally see the false news,” and “I do not deserve what I am asking of you. I am begging you to open your heart and forgive me.” Kopelson said that Griffin should “exclusively release the letter to Fox Broadcasting,” adding, “Do not send to the other networks.” “If you don’t do exactly what I’ve written, your career is over,” Kopelson wrote. A spokesman for CBS Corporation declined to comment. When I called Kopelson for comment, he said, “I’m tied up” as soon as I explained the reason for the call, and hung up the phone. Kopelson did not respond to a request for comment via email. 
  
 Griffin tells me that Kopelson’s email was indicative of “men who control the checkbooks,” who, despite the entertainment industry’s liberal reputation, tend to be more conservative and don’t like people who rock the boat. She acknowledged that revealing details about people like Kopelson, Cooper, and Zucker is unusual, and could harm her future employment prospects. 
  
 But Griffin occupies an unusual space in comedy: Like her late friend and mentor Joan Rivers, she has constantly struggled to be taken seriously, but managed to build a substantial fan base that has enriched her and made her very famous. Her concert agent showed me Ticketmaster data indicating that over the past 13 years, Griffin has sold over 1.2 million tickets to her shows. 
  
 Griffin says she wants to focus on First Amendment issues now. She’s hoping to organize a First Amendment concert with the ACLU, and she’s working on a documentary film of her upcoming international tour, as well as a docu-series, although none of these projects has come to fruition yet. 
  
 In the meantime, although she’s still too worried about her physical safety to tour America, Griffin is off around the world. Her act will feature plenty of Trump jokes, despite the fact that some of her friends have suggested she take it easy on the president for a while. 
  
 Rick Wilson thinks she has no alternative. “The way Trump wins is if he shuts people up permanently and scares them off from being vocal critics,” he said. “She has to go back to war.”

"An independent commission concluded Ferdinand's response to a tweet describing Chelsea's Ashley Cole as a ""choc ice"" did not make him a racist.
""It is the idea that a black person is black only in skin colour but inside they are really white. It's a highly derogatory term. It's a dangerous term because it allows black boys especially but black people in general, to believe that there is a way of being black that is somehow distinct from being white. There are people that think if you don't wear a certain type of clothing or listen to a certain type of music you're not really black. It's a really dangerous thing. There are black boys who do less well in school because they believe by doing well there, they are acting white. To me, this is devastating for black boys and black people everywhere. It's a deeply offensive term with racial connotations.""
But it was ruled the centre-half had brought the game into disrepute.
""The commission found that the breach included a reference to ethnic origin, colour or race,"" read an FA statement.
Ferdinand was also warned as to his future conduct. Manchester United have decided not to appeal against the decision.
The United defender tweeted: ""I hear you fella! Choc ice is classic hahahahahaha!!"" in response to a message from @carltonEbanks which stated: ""Looks like Ashley Cole's going to be their choc ice. Then again he's always been a sell out. Shame on him.""
The term relates to the black and white nature of a choc ice and can imply someone is being black on the outside and white on the inside.
The tweet appeared on Ferdinand's timeline after Chelsea and England left-back Cole appeared in court as a defence witness for team-mate John Terry, who was cleared of racially abusing Ferdinand's younger brother, Anton, in a game against QPR on 23 October last year.
Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said: ""They (the FA) want to close the door on this kind of thing.
""What surprises me is that other players have been twittering for ages and have never been challenged by the FA.
""His (Ferdinand's) status in the game has caused that and who he plays for is maybe another issue.""
In bringing their charge, the FA made it clear they did not feel Ferdinand was a racist, rather that he had acted improperly.
In a statement outlining their decision, the commission said: ""The Football Association clearly states that this is not an allegation that Mr Ferdinand is a racist, concedes that he is not a racist but contends that his conduct in endorsing @carltonEbanks tweet in a public forum is a term of abuse and brought the game into disrepute.""
This is Mr Ferdinand's first offence. He was the Football Association's 'Poster boy' and role model to other professional footballers in the use of Twitter and has a track record in fronting anti-racism campaigns in football
Ferdinand conceded the tweet was insulting, although he insisted in the hearing he was not expressing a racist view.
The commission's report continued: ""Mr Ferdinand stated the words 'choc ice' was a reference to race... but also means the person is fake.
""He accepted that the words of the tweet were insulting and conceded that the term could only be used when referring to a black or mixed race person and not a person with white skin.
""Mr Ferdinand therefore admitted that the term 'choc ice' referred to Mr Cole's colour, ethnic origin or race.
""The charge is proven and the breach of FA Rule E3 was aggravated by reference to Mr Cole's colour, ethnic origin or race.""
The hearing did accept there were mitigating factors taken into consideration before they decided on their punishment.
""A number of factors have to be considered in determining the penalty,"" the statement read.
""This is Mr Ferdinand's first offence. He has a clear disciplinary record. He was the Football Association's 'Poster boy' and role model to other professional footballers in the use of Twitter and has a track record in fronting anti-racism campaigns in football.
""It was in response to a tweet rather than an original tweet.""
A representative for Cole released a statement soon after Ferdinand's tweet to emphasis he still viewed the Manchester United defender as a friend.
""Ashley Cole wishes to make it clear that he and Rio Ferdinand are good friends and he has no intention of making any sort of complaint,"" it read.
""Ashley appreciates that Tweeting is so quick it often results in offhand and stray comments.""
Since Ferdinand's tweet Terry has been charged with improper conduct by the FA for the alleged comments he made to Anton Ferdinand, a charge he has vowed to contest.
Terry, 31, is alleged to have used ""abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour"" during the game.","Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand has been found guilty of improper conduct and fined £45,000 by the Football Association for comments on Twitter."

"Andy Lack, the chairman of NBC News, emailed employees on September 3 to dispute allegations that the news network hindered or tried to kill Ronan Farrow's reporting on Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood mogul who has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault. 
  
 Dear Colleagues, 
  
 This is an unusual situation for a news division. In the last several days, questions surrounding how NBC News handled Ronan Farrow's investigation of Harvey Weinstein have resurfaced. The following pages lay out all the facts dispassionately and in necessary detail -- from start to finish. If you have any remaining questions, please don't hesitate to ask. 
  
 For the past nine months, it has been our belief that the 'story' here is about Harvey Weinstein's horrendous behavior and about the suffering and bravery of his victims, rather than a back-and-forth between a reporter and his producer and a news network. However, we've watched with disappointment as unfounded intimations and accusations have traveled through media circles. 
  
 At NBC News, one of our primary goals is to produce outstanding investigative journalism that stands up to intense scrutiny and has a meaningful impact on society. We had that goal very much in mind when we first assigned Ronan Farrow to look into rumors in Hollywood about Harvey Weinstein, as many other news organizations had done before us over the span of two decades. 
  
 We spent eight months pursuing the story but at the end of that time, NBC News -- like many others before us -- still did not have a single victim or witness willing to go on the record. (Rose McGowan -- the only woman Farrow interviewed who was willing to be identified -- had refused to name Weinstein and then her lawyer sent a cease-and-desist letter.) So we had nothing yet fit to broadcast. But Farrow did not agree with that standard. That's where we parted ways -- agreeing to his request to take his reporting to a print outlet that he said was ready to move forward immediately. 
  
 Seven weeks later, and five days after Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey broke the Weinstein story in The New York Times, Farrow published the first in a series of outstanding stories for The New Yorker, winning great acclaim and attention, all of which is well deserved. That story cited the following victims by name: Asia Argento, Mira Sorvino, Rosanna Arquette, Lucia Evans, Emma de Caunes, Jessica Barth, and Sophie Dix. Not one of these seven women was included in the reporting Farrow presented while at NBC News. 
  
 We regret the deterioration of NBC's relationship with Ronan, and genuinely wish we had found a path to move forward together. That is why, in August of 2017, when Farrow objected to his editors' conclusion we convened an independent group of the most experienced investigative journalists in our organization to review his material with fresh eyes. We asked them -- tell us what, if anything, we can broadcast. But their conclusion was unequivocal -- this story is not ready for air. (Further, they found several elements in Farrow's draft script which did not hold up to scrutiny -- described in the accompanying document.) It was Farrow's decision, in the midst of this process, to pursue the story elsewhere. 
  
 Had we refused his request, NBC might have ultimately broken the story, but we wondered then, and still wonder now, whether the brave women who spoke to him in print would have also sat before TV cameras and lights. If we had tried to hold him and nothing changed, we would have needlessly blocked him from disseminating it via another forum. And that is why we agreed to let him go elsewhere. If some believe that decision a failure of our competitive instincts, so be it. But it was a decision undertaken honorably and with good intentions toward Farrow and his work. 
  
 Contrary to recent allegations, at no point did NBC obstruct Farrow's reporting or ""kill"" an interview. Immediately after Farrow had parted ways with us, he asked for NBC cameras to record another anonymous Weinstein victim. Farrow conducted the interview but we declined the request for a crew because we believed filming another anonymous interview would not get us any closer to clearing the threshold to broadcast, and because he had already informed us he was pursuing the story for another outlet. (The victim Farrow anonymously interviewed did not ultimately speak on the record for The New Yorker or The New York Times.) Furthermore, we were increasingly concerned that repeatedly asking victims to sit for anonymous interviews in front of television cameras on this subject matter was no longer a productive approach. (For the record, the first television interview with a Weinstein victim aired on NBC News on October 9.) 
  
 Finally, a word on the baseless speculation that some interference by Harvey Weinstein played a role in our decision-making. The accompanying document recounts every interaction NBC News executives and editors had with Weinstein and his attorneys. It will surprise no one that they were dishonest in their dealings with us, often mischaracterizing our brief conversations. But in each instance, their calls were either completely ignored or met with a boilerplate commitment to allow them to comment if and when something was ready for broadcast. None of this was kept secret from Farrow. None of it was any different from the calls we receive on every other difficult story our investigative unit regularly breaks. And none of it played any role in our decision-making. 
  
 Our Investigative Unit, led by Rich Greenberg, is filled with the best journalists in the business doing a remarkable job. They consistently shepherd difficult stories onto the air and drive the daily news cycle. Over the past year-and-a-half they have delivered an astounding 420 exclusive stories on politics, national security, business and technology and more. 
  
 As we get back to work this week, we will continue to pursue the toughest stories, in the most challenging circumstances, involving the most powerful people. And we will keep doing it while upholding the journalistic standards that have been the backbone of this outstanding news organization. 
  
 Thank you for your great work this summer.

He called NBC’s handling of the matter “a massive breach of journalistic ethics” and said unnamed higher-ups had ordered the cancellation of an interview with a Weinstein accuser in August of last year, effectively killing the investigation. 
  
 Mr. Lack’s email was partly an attempt to defend the network against Mr. McHugh’s statements. In his message to NBC News employees, the chairman publicly defended the network’s handling of the Weinstein story for the first time. 
  
 “Contrary to recent allegations, at no point did NBC obstruct Farrow’s reporting or ‘kill’ an interview,” Mr. Lack wrote in the email. 
  
 The news executive went on to make the argument that Mr. Farrow’s reporting was not broadcast-ready last August, when he stopped working the Weinstein story for NBC. The main problem, he said, was the lack of on-the-record voices in the version of the story Mr. Farrow had prepared. 
  
 “We spent eight months pursuing the story but at the end of that time, NBC News — like many others before us — still did not have a single victim or witness willing to go on the record,” Mr. Lack wrote. |||||","– The Harvey Weinstein scandal is leading to another controversy that just keeps growing: how NBC News handled the investigation. Network exec Andy Lack defended NBC in a memo to employees Monday, but reporter Ronan Farrow then accused Lack of fudging the facts, reports CNN. It all centers on a serious accusation: Did NBC try to kill the story that Farrow, then a reporter for the network, presented to his bosses about Weinstein? One of Farrow's former producers made that allegation last week, accusing NBC of a ""massive breach of journalistic ethics."" But in his memo, Lack insisted that what Farrow presented wasn't ""fit for broadcast"" because it had too few women willing to go on air to corroborate the accusations. ""Contrary to recent allegations, at no point did NBC obstruct Farrow’s reporting or 'kill' an interview,"" Lack wrote. He added that the network let Farrow ""go elsewhere"" to flesh out the story, to the New Yorker. Farrow, however, says Lack's statement ""contains numerous false or misleading statements,"" per the New York Times. For one thing, ""the suggestion to take the story to another outlet was first raised by NBC, not me,"" wrote Farrow, ""and I took them up on it only after it became clear that I was being blocked from further reporting."" He said his piece for NBC was ""twice cleared and deemed 'reportable' by legal and standards only to be blocked by executives who refused to allow us to seek comment from Harvey Weinstein."" Lack says that's not true, and he dismissed as ""baseless"" the accusation that Weinstein himself exerted some kind of influence on NBC's decision. Farrow, for his part, is working on a book about the entire situation."
"(CNN) -- In The World According to Dennis Rodman, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whom he just saw on his second trip to the country, is quite likable. ""He has to do his job, but he's a very good guy,"" Rodman said Monday at a news conference, announcing plans for a ""basketball diplomacy"" event that will involve players from North Korea. Meanwhile, Kim presides over one of the most repressive regimes on Earth. As Human Rights Watch puts it, Kim's succession as supreme leader after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011, ""had little impact on the country's dire human rights record."" People are subjected to torture and thrown into prison camps based on political charges. Those who have managed to escape describe horror that includes beatings, starvation and executions. As CNN has reported, Kim Jong Un appears to have changed nothing in the camps. U.S. citizen Kenneth Bae knows first-hand.  He's currently in one, charged with ""serious crimes"" and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for allegedly trying to bring down the government through religious activities. Bae's family says he owned a tour company and was in North Korea for work. The accusations against him were spelled out on state-run media, which is the only kind of media that ""very good guy"" Kim Jong Un and his country allow. Bae from North Korean prison: Please help me . Par for the course in North Korea, where people have no freedom. In 2012, ""Defectors continued to report extrajudicial killings, disappearances, arbitrary detention, arrests of political prisoners, and torture,"" the U.S. State Department Human Rights Report says. ""The judiciary was not independent and did not provide fair trials. There continued to be reports of severe punishment of some repatriated refugees and their family members. There were reports of trafficked women among refugees and workers crossing the border into China. ""The government made no known attempts to prosecute officials who committed human rights abuses."" Meanwhile, much of the country starves. More than 25% of North Korean children under the age of 5 suffered from chronic malnutrition in 2012, according to the National Nutrition Survey of North Korea, a report backed by UNICEF, the World Food Program and the World Health Organization. The report also found nearly one in three women suffered from anemia. The North Korea we rarely see . Rodman: Come with me . In The World According to Dennis Rodman, journalists would realize that his rosy description of Kim is really the right one, if only they'd go over there and see for themselves. ""You write what you hear, but you don't see what you write,"" Rodman complained, saying he wants to bring a journalist on one of his trips to visit his friend. Yes, that's the problem, Mr. Rodman. North Korea is aching for journalists to roam freely around the country and report to the world what things are really like. ""My military minder tells me to turn my camera off, and it soon becomes clear why,"" CNN's Paula Hancocks wrote last month on a trip to the ""hermit kingdom."" ""The poverty I see through the bus window is not the view of North Korea the regime wants to be seen. ... Buildings are in disrepair; some barely look inhabitable. Residents of this small town walk or sit by the side of the road, many seeming to have little to do. A number of official-looking men dressed in brown Mao suits stand silently on street corners. ... Despite the driver traveling as quickly as possible through these inhabited areas, you could still sense the local community being monitored."" ""It was a tightly restricted, carefully stage-managed tour rich with propaganda and political theater and little else,"" CNN's Ivan Watson wrote in July of his five-day trip to Pyongyang. ""It offered virtually no insight into what life is like for ordinary citizens who live in this rigid dictatorship."" ""We were not allowed to leave the confines of the Yanggakdo International Hotel unless we were riding a government bus. During my five days in North Korea, the authorities did not even allow me to see what the country's currency looks like."" ""Our three-man crew was assigned two very polite minders who accompanied us everywhere outside of the hotel and made no secret about the fact that they had veto rights if we were to take pictures of something that they didn't approve of,"" he added on CNN's GPS blog. ""So they would basically tell us what we could and could not take pictures of."" Rodman: Kim just wants to talk . In The World According to Dennis Rodman, Kim Jong Un just wants to talk. ""It's about trying to open Obama's and everyone's minds,"" he said Monday, aiming some of his remarks at the U.S. president. ""You don't have to talk about politics. ... Meet him or even give him a call. That's all he wants."" Meanwhile, Kim might be even more bellicose than his father was. On CNN's GPS blog, three analysts say an analysis of language used in the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency ""shows the use of terms such as 'war' and 'nuclear' far more prevalent than terms such as 'peace' and 'reconciliation.' "" A U.S. defense official said North Korea has been using ""warmongering rhetoric."" Rodman: I held Kim's daughter . In The World According to Dennis Rodman, Kim opening ""his heart and mind"" and allowing Rodman to hold his daughter ""for the first time in history"" is something to celebrate. Never mind that the existence of said child has been shrouded in secrecy. North Korea's regime is so restrictive that even state media haven't mentioned the possibility that their leader might have had a daughter. And speaking of children, Rodman shared an interesting detail Monday involving the ""basketball diplomacy"" event he's putting together with Paddy Power, an online betting company. ""The marshall"" -- the term Kim goes by -- ""gave me anything I wanted,"" he said. Kim told him, ""We've got 150,000 kids will do anything for you on the field. We've got 95,000 people will be in the stadium watching this game."" A dictator telling a foreign basketball player he can instruct 150,000 kids, who will comply: In The World According to Dennis Rodman, that's a good thing. Still, reason for hope . Any effort to, as Rodman says, ""bridge a gap"" with North Korea can be construed as a good thing. ""I said to him, 'Your grandfather and your father did some bad things ... but you are trying to change,' "" Rodman said at Monday's news conference. Kim has an ""image"" to keep up, he added. Maybe, one day, Kim Jong Un will knock down the walls behind which his country tries to hide its reality -- including the desperation, pain and horror described by defectors and refugees. Struggling for survival, family tries to feed child mice . But for now, Kim's propaganda machine is ratcheting up, as CNN has reported. Rodman says Kim asked him to do one thing: ""Tell the American people we're very cool."" Mission accomplished, Mr. Rodman.","Dennis Rodman calls North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un ""a very good guy""
Human Rights Watch says Kim has had little effect on North Korea's dismal rights record .

"Killeen, Texas (CNN) -- The U.S. Army private who authorities say admitted to planning to bomb a restaurant popular with soldiers from Fort Hood is to be held without bond, a federal magistrate ordered Friday. Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo was formally charged with possession of an unregistered destructive device. Additional charges are likely, said Daryl Fields, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in San Antonio, Texas. Abdo, who refused to stand when Judge Jeffrey C. Manske entered the courtroom, shouted an apparent reference to the 2006 rape of an Iraqi girl by U.S. soldiers and the 2009 shooting spree at Fort Hood by Army Maj. Nidal Hasan before being hustled out of the courtroom by marshals. Abdo, a Muslim American soldier who had been granted conscientious objector status before going AWOL, was being held Friday in federal custody at an undisclosed location. According to the criminal complaint unsealed after his appearance Friday, Abdo admitted he planned to turn two pressure cookers found in his Killeen hotel room into gunpowder- and shrapnel-filled bombs to detonate inside an unnamed restaurant popular with soldiers from Fort Hood. Among other things, police and FBI investigators who searched the room found six bottles of gunpowder, shotgun shells and pellets and ammunition cartridges. Police who arrested him found wire, a handgun, ammunition and an article titled, ""Make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom"" in the backpack he was carrying, according to the complaint. The backpack also contained a notebook with a hand-written list for many of the components police recovered. The public defender appointed to represent Abdo, attorney Keith Dorsett of Waco, did not immediately respond to e-mails and telephone messages seeking comment. Killeen police arrested Abdo, 21, on Wednesday after a gun store employee tipped them that Abdo's behavior had raised red flags when he purchased six pounds of smokeless gunpowder and other supplies. The tip came from Greg Ebert, a retired police officer who works at the Guns Galore gun store. He said the young man appeared suspicious as soon as he pulled up in a taxi cab. ""How many people go shopping at gun stores in a taxi cab?"" Ebert asked. He described Abdo as being guarded and asking odd questions. Abdo browsed for about 20 minutes, Ebert said, choosing six pounds of gunpowder, shotgun ammunition and a magazine for a semiautomatic handgun. He asked Ebert what smokeless gunpowder was before finishing the purchase. ""Well, hello! Why are you buying this if you don't know what it's for?"" Ebert said later. ""That is a red flag for me. He should know. Why is he buying that much?"" Ebert said he called police after discussing the transaction at length with the owner of the store, which is the same place where Hasan bought supplies for his shooting spree. Abdo joined the infantry in 2009 and was assigned to Company E of the 101st Airborne Division's 1st Brigade Combat Team when he refused to deploy to Afghanistan on religious grounds. The Army approved his request to be discharged as a conscientious objector. But on May 13, he was charged with possession of child pornography on his computer, according to the statement. After a June 15 hearing, at which Abdo was recommended for court-martial, he went AWOL. In media interviews last year, Abdo talked about seeking conscientious objector status, saying he felt compelled to remain true to his faith. ""We have two things that I believe make us American, and that's freedom of religion and freedom of choice,"" he said. When he signed up for the military, Abdo said, he had not thought that his religious beliefs would be an issue. ""I was under the impression that I could serve both the U.S. Army and my God simultaneously,"" he said. But as his deployment neared, he began to rethink things and eventually worked up the courage to approach his unit and tell them how he felt, he said. ""Islam is a much more peaceful and tolerant religion than it is an aggressive religion,"" he said. ""I don't believe that Islam allows me to operate in any kind of warfare at all, including the U.S. military and any war it partakes in. I believe that our first duty as a Muslim is to serve God."" In court Friday, Abdo mentioned ""Iraq 2006,"" an apparent reference to an incident in which U.S. Army soldiers were accused of killing three members of an Iraqi family, including a 6-year-old girl, and raping the family's 14-year-old girl before also killing her and setting the bodies on fire in an attempt to cover up the killings. Four soldiers were convicted and imprisoned for their roles in the shootings, rape and subsequent cover-up. After Abdo's arrest, Texas Gov. Rick Perry issued a statement calling it ""a sobering reminder of the importance of remaining vigilant in the ongoing efforts to protect our communities from those that would do us harm."" Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, the House Army Caucus chairman, praised the gun-shop employee who tipped police to Abdo, as well as the police themselves, for interrupting what could have been a deadly plot. ""Thanks to quick action by a Texas gun dealer in alerting local police to a suspicious character, and a prompt and vigorous response by the Killeen Police Department, we may well have averted a repeat of the tragic 2009 radical Islamic terror attack on our nation's largest military installation,"" he said. ""We now have an example of what works to prevent these type attacks, and as the coming days reveal more details about this attempt, we can determine better ways to thwart similar efforts in the future,"" Carter said. In addition to being the site of the Fort Hood shootings, Killeen is also where, in 1991, George Hennard crashed his pickup into a Luby's cafeteria, fatally shot 23 people and wounded another 20 before killing himself. ""We've been through a lot in this community,"" Killeen Police Chief Dennis Baldwin said. ""But I can tell you that's when the character of the community is more obvious."" CNN's Tracy Sabo, Barbara Starr, Marylynn Ryan and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: Naser Jason Abdo makes a reference to the 2006 rape and murder of an Iraqi girl .

"HP acquired the WebOS operating system when it bought veteran gadget maker Palm in 2011 for $1.2bn (Â£789m).
Financial details of the deal have not been disclosed but HP is not thought to have recouped much of the money it paid for Palm.
LG said the WebOS code would be used to power its next-generation smart TV technology.
The WebOS was created to run smartphones, tablets and other devices developed by Palm that, in its early days, pioneered the handheld gadget industry. However, Palm's influence has diminished as Apple, Google's Android and RIM's Blackberry have come to dominate the smartphone and tablet markets.
In the deal, LG gets WebOS source code, engineers working on it, documentation and the websites that promote it. HP is holding on to patents underlying WebOS as well as technology that helps it connect to web-based services.
HP did launch products running WebOS, such as the TouchPad tablet, but poor sales led it to seek other ways to boost interest in the software. One way it chose was to open up the code to any developer to work on. LG was one of the first firms to take up this chance and the acquisition grew out of this relationship.
Using WebOS in TV sets made ""sense"" for LG, said Ovum analyst Tony Cripps, adding that it could herald a return to the software's smartphone roots.
WebOS's use of core web technology left it well placed for the next generation of mobile apps that were likely to be based around the same code, he said.
The acquisition was probably driven by LG's recognition that it needed to make gadgets of all types easier to use, added Mr Cripps.
""Device manufacturers are recognising the need to differentiate through software-based innovation in user experience,"" he said.
The deal with LG was announced as HP took the wraps off its first Android-powered tablet, called the HP Slate 7, at the 2013 Mobile World Congress currently under way in Barcelona.","Electronics giant HP is selling off the code, staff and technology involved in its WebOS software to Korean firm LG."
"Philadelphia (CNN) -- At first, a Philadelphia landlord said, he thought one of his tenants was attempting to conceal a dog after finding a dog dish in the basement of his apartment building. But on a return trip to the basement Saturday, Turgut Gozleveli found something much more sinister: four mentally disabled people held captive, including one man chained to a radiator. ""It was terrible,"" he said Sunday, adding the people were surrounded by human waste. ""I don't know how long they were there."" Three people have been arrested and accused of holding the people captive and stealing their Social Security checks. Linda Ann Weston, 51; Thomas Gregory, 47; and Eddie Wright, 49, face charges including criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, kidnapping, criminal trespass, unlawful restraint, and false imprisonment, Philadelphia police said in a statement Sunday. The alleged victims include a 29-year-old woman and three men, ages 31, 35 and 41, said Philadelphia police Lt. Ray Evers. All seven -- the three suspects and four alleged victims -- had been traveling together, he said, but did not know for how long. Weston is believed to have been in McLean, Texas, with some or all of the alleged victims. They then traveled to Florida and Philadelphia, Evers said. Gozleveli, who also serves as the building's janitor, said he was contacted Thursday by the block captain of a neighborhood group regarding suspicious activity. He checked out the basement that day and found a few things out of place, but no people. On Friday, he found the dog dish. On Saturday, after hearing a dog barking, he went to the building's sub-basement and found a door chained shut. He found the people after removing the chains. ""Other than the barking dog there was no sound,"" he said. ""... I said, 'What the hell are you doing here?' No answer, and I called 911."" ""This was a total surprise,"" Gozleveli said. ""I never expected to find people. I just expected to find a dog."" The people, he said, ""acted like children."" The four were in a room roughly 10 feet by 15 feet, Gozleveli said, and looked malnourished and disheveled. They had a metal bucket and a jug of what appeared to be orange juice, but no food. They also had pillows and blankets, but didn't know where they were or where they had come from, he said. Authorities believe the four were trapped in the tiny room for up to a week. Evers said they suffered from bed sores and ""injuries that are very, very hard to describe."" The alleged victims appeared to be malnourished and were taken to a hospital. They were listed in stable condition Sunday, police said. The FBI is also investigating. The northeast Philadelphia building is a former movie theater converted to a seven-unit apartment building. Police cars were still outside the building Sunday afternoon. The four people found in the basement were brought out on stretchers, said Danyell Tisdale, the block captain who notified Gozleveli. She said she was concerned about some of the things she'd seen recently, including people being brought in from the back of an SUV with out-of-state plates. ""I hope I did enough,"" she said.

"David Moyes insists that no-one is good enough to displace Wayne Rooney up front for both Manchester United and England. Moyes, who put Rooney at the heart of his Manchester United side before being sacked in April after less than a year in charge, reckons that the best could be yet to come from the forward - so long as he concentrates on scoring goals rather than all-action forays across the pitch. The Scot did, however, urge Rooney's team-mates to help ease the pressure on their captain by creating more chances for him.

Radamel Falcao's blockbuster loan signing at United has raised questions over Rooney's role in his club team, while Raheem Sterling's emergence has led to calls for the Liverpool starlet to fill the No 10 role in Roy Hodgson's side currently occupied by Rooney.

"A new project seeks to kickstart a revival for the world’s largest rainforest by planting new trees — tens of millions of them. 
  
 The project, announced Friday at the “Rock in Rio” music fest in Brazil, aims to restore 73 million trees in the Brazilian Amazon by 2023. Spanning 30,000 hectares of land (about 74,000 acres), the project is the largest tropical forest restoration in the world and helps Brazil move towards its Paris Agreement target of reforesting 12 million hectares of land by 2030. 
  
 “This is a breathtakingly audacious project,” said M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International (CI), one of the partners behind the effort. “The fate of the Amazon depends on getting this right — as do the region’s 25 million residents, its countless species and the climate of our planet.” 
  
 The Amazon forest is home to the richest biodiversity of any ecosystem on the planet — a recent report described some 400 new species discovered in the Amazon between 2014 and 2015 alone — yet is rapidly vanishing with increasing global demand for resources. The economy, essentially focused on the exploitation of natural resources, minerals and agribusiness, has already led to about 20 percent of original forest cover to be replaced by pastures and agricultural crops, without securing the well-being of the local population. The reforestation project fills an urgent need to develop the region’s economy without destroying its forests and ensuring the well-being of its people.

 “A new chapter is being written for the Brazilian Amazon with this initiative,” said Rodrigo Medeiros, vice president of CI’s Brazil office. “Protecting the Amazon is not something we should think in the future — we have to do it now.” 
  
 The project is a partnership between Conservation International, the Brazilian Ministry of Environment, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the World Bank, the Brazilian Biodiversity Fund (Funbio) and Rock in Rio’s environmental arm “Amazonia Live.” 
  
 The reforestation effort is part of a broader regional initiative, the Amazonia Sustainable Landscapes Project. This project aims to increase the area of forest ecosystems, promote the connectivity of protected areas within the Amazon, and further develop local productive activities and value chains derived from the sustainable use of Amazonian biodiversity, including production of native species of seeds and seedlings. 
  
 Priority areas for the restoration effort include southern Amazonas, Rondônia, Acre, Pará and the Xingu watershed. Restoration activities will include the enrichment of existing secondary forest areas, sowing of selected native species, and, when necessary, direct planting of native species, Medeiros said.

 Further reading ||||| There are more habitable planets in our galaxy than humans living on planet Earth. But the nearest one is about 70 trillion miles away , which means that, for now, and for the foreseeable future, Earth is the only life-supporting rock hurtling through infinite space we’ll ever know. It’s really not the best idea to let it burn up–and key to keeping it cool are the massive rainforests of the Amazon. Sadly, we’ve had a hard time not cutting them down. 
  
 A new project should help prevent–or at least slow down–that hot future. If all goes to plan over the next six years, a project led by Conservation International will become the largest tropical reforestation project in history. Seventy-three million trees will sprout up across what’s known as the “arc of deforestation,” in the Brazilian states of Amazonas, Acre, Pará, Rondônia, and throughout the Xingu watershed. The short-term plan is to restore 70,000 acres (the area of 30,000 soccer fields) that have been cleared for pastureland to their former forested glory. 
  
  
  
 “If the world is to hit the 1.2°C or 2°C [degrees of warming] target that we all agreed to in Paris, then protecting tropical forests in particular has to be a big part of that,” M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, tells Fast Company. “It’s not just the trees that matter, but what kind of trees. If you’re really thinking about getting carbon dioxide out of atmosphere, then tropical forests are the ones that end up mattering the most.” 
  
 He’s right: Simply stopping deforestation could allow existing forests to absorb up to 37% of our annual carbon emissions; replenishing degraded areas could do significantly more for the planet. 
  
 “This is not a stunt,” Sanjayan says. “It is a carefully controlled experiment to literally figure out how to do tropical restoration at scale, so that people can replicate it and we can drive the costs down dramatically.” 
  
 Over the past 40 years, about 20% of the Amazon has been cut down or destroyed, and scientists worry that another 20% of the rainforest will be lost in the next couple of decades. So, instead of following precedent and planting saplings, which are labor and resource intensive to manage (and, depending on the selected species, may not be best-suited for the territory, resulting in less than ideal survival rates), the organizing coalition is trying something different. 
  
  
  
 Developed in Brazil only a few years ago, the new planting technique is called muvuca. “In Portuguese, it means a lot of people in a very small place,” says Rodrigo Medeiros, Conservation International’s vice president of the Brazil program and the lead on the ground. 
  
  ||||| Assuming everything goes to plan, over the next six years, the Amazon rainforest will get 73 million new trees. The mass planting is part of a project sponsored by Conservation International, the Brazilian Ministry of Environment, and a number of other NGOs and corporations. As John Converse Townsend at Fast Company reports, it is the largest tropical reforestation effort ever attempted. 
  
 According to a press release from Conservation International, the effort will span deforested pasture lands over a 74,000-acre region spanning several Brazilian states—with the greatest focus in Southern Amazonas, Rondônia, Acre, Pará and the Xingu watershed. The purpose of the project is, in part, to revive the 20 percent of the Amazon that has been lost to deforestation due to agriculture and pasturing during the last 40 years. But the effort is also geared toward learning how to restore tropical forests. 
  
 “This is a breathtakingly audacious project,” says M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, according to the release. “The fate of the Amazon depends on getting this right—as do the region’s 25 million residents, its countless species and the climate of our planet.” 
  
 As Townsend reports, reforestation efforts are typically very costly and time consuming—requiring people to both grow and plant thousands of saplings, many of which will not survive. In this latest effort, the restorationists are trying a new method called muvuca, in which they will spread the seeds of native trees across the slash and burned land and animal pastures. The seeds come from the Xingu Seed Network, which uses a coalition of 400 collectors to gather the seeds from native trees. 
  
 “With plant-by-plant reforestation techniques, you get a typical density of about 160 plants per hectare,” Rodrigo Medeiros, vice president of Conservation International’s Brazil program, tells Townsend. “With muvuca, the initial outcome is 2,500 [trees] per hectare. And after 10 years, you can reach 5,000 trees per hectare. It’s much more diverse, much more dense, and less expensive than traditional techniques.” 
  
 The muvuca experiment is the beginning of a massive effort announced by Brazil to restore 12 million hectares of forest, an area the size of Pennsylvania, as part of an effort to reach their climate change goals under the Paris Accord. Recent studies show that second growth forests—those less than 60 years old that grow after logging or land clearance—can sequester huge amounts of carbon. As Townsend reports, just stopping current deforestation could help mitigate 37 percent of current carbon emissions. Planting or restoring forests could make that number even bigger. 
  
 While the effort is impressive, it’s not the largest reforestation effort in the world. In July, 2016, 800,000 people in Uttar Pradesh, India, planted 50 million trees in just 24 hours, a publicity stunt to highlight India’s Paris Accord commitment to reforest 12 percent of its land by 2030. The world’s largest program, however, is China’s Grain-for-Green effort, a plan to restore 69.2 million acres of forest land, which is an area the size of New York and Pennsylvania combined. 
  
 All of these efforts are encouraging, but replanting is only half of the solution. Twenty-five million acres of forests are cleared each year, writes Doug Boucher, Director of Climate Research and Analysis at the Union of Concerned Scientists. He points out that while the long-term benefits of reforestation are helpful for the climate, the decades it takes for forests to regrow means it will take a while to see benefits. This means other more immediate solutions, such as reducing industrial emissions and halting the removal of forests, are still necessary to make a dent in our changing climate. |||||","– The Amazon rainforest's ""arc of deforestation"" could soon have 73 million new trees. In an effort to reseed 74,000 acres of the Amazon—20% of which has been destroyed in the last 40 years—Conservation International, the World Bank, Brazil's environmental ministry, and several other groups are working together to spread seeds in the Amazonas, Acre, Pará, Rondonia, and Xingu areas of Brazil, reports Fast Company. Reforestation normally involves saplings, which must be grown and planted. But Conservation International CEO M. Sanjayan hopes dropping seeds from 200 native species per square meter of land, in what is known as the muvuca strategy, will ""drive the costs down dramatically"" and produce a greater diversity and density of plants. ""If you're really thinking about getting carbon dioxide out of [the] atmosphere, then tropical forests are the ones that end up mattering the most,"" says Sanjayan, noting the move will help Brazil reach its Paris Accord target of reforesting an area the size of Pennsylvania by 2030, per Smithsonian. A release notes it's the ""largest tropical forest restoration in the world."" Up to 2,000 locals will work together to seed each hectare, with families receiving $700 per hectare. Additional seeds will also be distributed in existing forested areas. Some 90% of seeds are expected to germinate, though only the strongest will survive. A leader of the program predicts there will be 2,500 trees per hectare after six years and up to 5,000 after 10 years. (Deforestation has revealed millennia-old ""geoglyphs"" in Brazil.)"
"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)A man opposed to joint South Korean-U.S. military drills attacked the American ambassador in Seoul, slashing his face and arm as he was about to give a speech Thursday morning, authorities said. North Korea quickly called the stabbing a ""knife attack of justice"" and said it reflected ""anti-U.S. sentiment"" in South Korea. Authorities have obtained an arrest warrant for the knifing suspect, Kim Ki-Jong, an official at Seoul Central District Court said Friday. He was detained immediately after the attack, with authorities having time to formally arrest him or let him go. Kim, 55, who has a history of unpredictable behavior, could eventually be charged with attempted murder and other charges. A police official, Yoon Myeong-seong, also told reporters that Kim had previously visited North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007, and that authorities were ""intensively investigating"" a possible connection between his visits to the reclusive state and this attack. The U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Mark Lippert, was in stable condition after undergoing more than two hours of surgery, in which he got 80 stitches to his face. He will probably remain hospitalized for three to four days, said Dr. Jung Nam-shik at Yonsei Severance Hospital. In 2010, Kim received a suspended two-year prison sentence for throwing a piece of concrete at a Japanese ambassador to South Korea, according to the Yonhap news agency. The motive for his attack Thursday? He wanted an end to the South Korean-U.S. military drills to improve North-South relations, police said. The drills are held annually despite predictably harsh criticism from North Korea. The North Korean government believes the attack is ""just punishment for U.S. warmongers,"" according to its official news agency, KCNA. South Korean President Park Geun-hye, on the other hand, condemned it. ""This incident is not only a physical attack on the U.S. ambassador,"" she said, ""but an attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance and it can never be tolerated."" U.S. diplomats have been attacked, killed in past . Lippert was attacked while attending an event organized by the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation, which advocates peaceful reunification between the two Koreas. The U.S. Embassy did not request special security for the event, Seoul police said. Three police officers were on duty at the building's entrance, and 25 others were on standby. Kim sat down at a different table than Lippert, then got up and ran to the ambassador's right side yelling something that sounded like anti-American sentiments. ""When the man jumped on the ambassador, I stood up and jumped on the man, and they both fell on the ground,"" a witness, Jang Yoon Seok, told CNN affiliate YTN. ""Luckily I got on top of the man's back and could press him to the floor. Then others came to hold him on the floor."" Jang said he later saw the knife on the table. It had a wooden handle and did not look particularly sophisticated, he said. Seoul police said a knife, about 10 inches long, was used in the assault and the suspect brought it from home. Videos showed the suspect pinned on the floor, rolled into a blanket and carried out of the building. He was heard shouting, ""The South Korea-U.S. military drills must stop."" The drills began earlier this week. Explaining the joint South Korea-U.S. military exercises . After the attack, Lippert -- clutching his right cheek and holding a bloodied arm -- was photographed hurrying out of the Sejong Cultural Institute in central Seoul. The cut to his face runs from his right cheekbone to his lower jaw and is about 4 inches long and about an inch deep, Dr. Jung said. Fortunately, there was no damage to his facial nerve. Lippert also suffered five gashes in his left arm and hand, but he is not likely to have permanent damage to his arm function. ""The ambassador was very calm. People around him were taken aback, but he was very calm,"" said Dr. John Linton. ""He was speaking with his doctor on what to do. It was surprising."" As the ambassador left and headed to the hospital, investigators arrived, hoping to figure out exactly what happened. While there are videos showing what happened at the event, none of them will be from closed-circuit surveillance cameras, said Yoon, the Seoul police chief. The only such camera outside the building did help authorities determine exactly when Lippert and Kim came in. Was the attack part of a larger plot? Did Kim have any help, implicit or explicit? Not if you ask him, according to the Seoul police chief. ""Kim insists that this was done by himself,"" Yoon said. ""But police are still investigating if he acted alone and what his motive was."" Park, South Korea's President, told Lippert by phone that she was surprised and deeply troubled to hear about the attack -- an incident similar to one targeting her several years ago -- the Asian nation's Foreign Ministry said on its website. The South Korean leader vowed that authorities will ""take necessary measures ... with utmost seriousness and urgency"" to get to the bottom of the latest attack. She also promised to keep close ties with the United States ""so that the incident would not have any negative implications on the (South Korean)-U.S. alliance,""  according to the ministry. For Park's American counterpart, President Barack Obama, the attack is personal as well as political. That's because Lippert is a longtime friend and confidant, having been part of Obama's inner circle for years. Obama called Lippert ""to tell him that he and his wife Robyn are in his thoughts and prayers, and to wish him the very best for a speedy recovery,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said. Lippert has been close to Obama ever since he arrived in the Senate in 2005. Lippert worked with Obama on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and traveled the world with the then-senator as he garnered the foreign policy experience that helped pave the way for his presidential campaign. When Obama declared he would run for president in the 2008 race, Lippert was by his side again, and was on the road with the candidate and ultimately served as the chief foreign policy adviser for the Obama campaign. Obama nominated Lippert to serve as ambassador to South Korea last year. Thursday afternoon, Lippert tweeted that he was recuperating. ""Doing well & in great spirits! Robyn, Sejun, Grigsby & I - deeply moved by the support!"" he tweeted, referring to his wife, his son and his dog. ""Will be back ASAP to advance US-ROK alliance!"" He then added in Korean, ""Let's work together!"" CNN's Judy Kwon, Paula Hancocks, Alexandra Jaffe, Stephen Collinson, Barbara Starr, Jim Acosta and journalist Hyoungjoo Choi contributed to this report.","Court: Authorities obtain an arrest warrant for the man suspected in the stabbing .

"Tests on three pairs of glasses held at the British Library showed the author's sight deteriorated considerably.
At the time, heavy metals like arsenic were used in medicines that Austen, who had rheumatism, may have taken.
Library experts have suggested such poisoning may also have contributed to her early death at the age of 41.
The novelist, who lived in Steventon, Hampshire, died on 18 July 1817 and the cause of her death has been the subject of much speculation.
The three pairs of glasses, kept in the Pride and Prejudice author's writing desk, were examined using a portable lens meter brought to the library to determine the strength of the lenses which, despite their age, remain in good condition.
Tests showed they increased in strength from +1.75 in each eye from the first pair to +4.75 and +5.0 in the final pair - meaning she would have found it very difficult to see well enough to read or write by the time she died.
British Library curator Sandra Tuppen said: ""There's the possibility of her being poisoned accidentally with a heavy metal such as arsenic. We know now that arsenic poisoning can cause cataracts.
""Arsenic was often put into medication for other types of illness, potentially for rheumatism, which we know Jane Austen suffered from.""
It is not known whether the glasses, made of real tortoiseshell and glass, were prescribed for Austen or she bought them herself.
The British Library is inviting optometrists to offer their opinions on the new theory.","Author Jane Austen was virtually blind at the end of her life possibly as a result of arsenic poisoning, experts have revealed."
"(CNN) -- The chief of staff to the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement resigned Saturday amid allegations that she helped create a culture of sexual discrimination against men. Suzanne Barr, chief of staff for ICE Director John Morton, voluntarily stepped down last month and had been on paid leave. In a letter to Morton, obtained by CNN, Barr called the allegations ""unfounded and without any merit"" and said she was confident her reputation would be restored. ""In recent weeks, I have been the focus of unfounded allegations designed to destroy my reputation, but of greater concern however, is the threat these allegations represent to the reputation of this agency and the men and women who proudly serve their country by advancing ICE's mission,"" she wrote. ""As such, I feel it is incumbent upon me to take every step necessary to prevent further harm to the agency and to prevent this from further distracting from our critical work."" ICE spokesman Brian Hale said Morton has received Barr's resignation. ""We wish her the best of luck in her future endeavors,"" he said. The move comes on the heels of a job discrimination lawsuit filed by the head of the ICE office in New York against the Department of Homeland Security and DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano. In the suit, New York ICE chief James Hayes claims he was passed over for promotions in favor of less-qualified women, some of whom used to work for Napolitano when she was governor of Arizona. As part of his lawsuit, Hayes cites behavior by Barr in an attempt to prove an alleged culture of sexual discrimination against men, according to Hayes' lawyer, Morris Fischer of Maryland. Hayes said Barr ""created a frat house-type atmosphere that is targeted to humiliate and intimidate male employees."" When the lawsuit was filed, ICE spokesman Hale said the allegations were under review and that Barr had voluntarily placed herself on leave pending the outcome of the investigation. That review is ongoing, according to a federal official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""We are obviously very pleased with the agency's first step in rectifying this situation by accepting Ms. Barr's resignation,"" said Fischer, Hayes' attorney. ""Now is the time for the agency to move forward and make restitution to the individuals harmed."" Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said Barr's resignation ""raises the most serious questions about management practices and personnel policies at the Department of Homeland Security."" The committee will continue a review of the case and the personnel practices of the DHS in general. In his lawsuit, Hayes blames Barr for ""sexually offensive behavior."" In one alleged incident, Hayes said Barr called a male employee at a hotel and screamed at him, using crude language to say she wanted to have sex with him. Hayes also said that Barr moved the office contents of three male employees into a men's bathroom at ICE headquarters in 2009. After his client's lawsuit was filed, Fischer said, he was contacted by other federal employees who had heard about Hayes' claim. They provided affidavits to Hayes and his lawyer alleging more sexually charged comments made by Barr, according to Fischer. ""We've been getting calls and e-mails from all over the country from people who want to come forward with information that may be helpful on this case,"" the attorney told CNN. In an affidavit provided to CNN, another ICE employee describes a 2009 meeting in the office of ICE Director Morton, during which employees were discussing personal plans for Halloween. The male employee says he overheard Barr ask a ""senior ICE employee"" about the size of his genitals. ""You're a sexy mother-(expletive),"" she allegedly said. Over 17 years, Hayes rose through the ranks from Border Patrol agent to a top position at headquarters in charge of Detention and Removal Operations, overseeing a $2.5 billion budget, his lawsuit states. Hayes claims he was removed from that job because of gender discrimination. He is suing to recover $335,000 in moving costs and lost bonuses he says he incurred when he was transferred in 2009 to New York from Washington. His lawyer says other ICE employees have been reimbursed for similar expenses. Hayes' lawsuit also claims he faced retaliation after threatening to file an Equal Opportunity Claim against DHS and cites six internal investigations that were all unfounded. However, all but one of those investigations against him involving complaints by fellow employees were initially filed before Napolitano took office in 2008. In court documents, Hayes said the complaints were reviewed after he began complaining. DHS has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit and denied allegations of discrimination and retaliation. Its attorneys argued that the ""unfounded allegations"" made against Barr are ""irrelevant"" and an ""attempt to embarrass or harass senior government officials."" According to a federal official who defended ICE as an agency of ""dedicated law enforcement professionals,"" Hayes' lawsuit is filled with ""false and unsubstantiated"" allegations against Barr and other DHS employees. The allegations ""do not align with the fact that Mr. Hayes has routinely held high-ranking assignments, including his current position as head of ICE's second-largest field office in New York, the official added. CNN's Ross Levitt and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: Suzanne Barr calls the allegations ""unfounded and without any merit""

"Phnom Penh (CNN) -- More than 20 striking garment workers were injured this week, including two pregnant women, during clashes with police outside a factory in Kampong Speu Province, Cambodia, a labor leader said. Roughly 4,000 workers have walked off the job at a factory owned by Sabrina (Cambodia) Garment Manufacturing, which supplies Nike and Lululemon Athletica. They are demanding a $14 monthly increase, from the $74 they make now, said Say Sokmy, secretary-general of the Free Trade Union of Workers of the Kingdom of Cambodia. Police used stun batons to disperse strikers on Monday, she said, injured more than twenty. Both Nike and Lululemon released statements, expressing concern about the incident. ""As outlined in Nike's Code of Conduct, Nike requires its contract manufacturers to respect their employees' rights to freedom of association,"" the U.S.-based company said in a statement. It continued: ""Workers are employed by the contract factories, not by Nike, and wages and compensation are the responsibility of the factories. It is our understanding that this factory raised its own minimum wage on May 1 and pays above the country's minimum wage."" Vancouver-based Lululemon Athletica said its sustainability teams are monitoring events and are in daily contact with the factory to ensure workers' safety. ""We require all of our vendors to uphold and respect the workers' rights around the freedom of association and collective bargaining as stated in our lululemon Code of Ethics,"" said Therese Hayes, vice president of sustainability. ""The current situation deeply concerns us and we will continue to be in close contact with our factory partner, and take any immediate actions if necessary."" Both companies stressed that the factory is part of Better Factories Cambodia (BFC), a program established by the International Labor Organization to monitor workplaces and offer advice. According to BFC, the garment industry employs some 400,000 workers and accounts for $4 billion, or roughly 80%, of Cambodia's total export revenue. Most of what's made is exported to the European Union and the United States. READ MORE: Inside a Bangladesh garment factory that plays by the rules . OPINION: Stop cashing in on Bangladeshi workers .

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 18:18 EST, 5 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 07:16 EST, 6 January 2014 . Doctors are concerned that data harvested from patients by the Government will fall into the hands of hackers or be sold to insurers and drugs firms for use in targeting patients . Doctors are rebelling against plans to harvest personal information from the medical files of millions of patients. From spring, officials will begin building a giant database they say will help them identify poor performance such as long waiting times and late diagnosis of diseases such as cancer. They believe the information might even lead to new treatments. But there is widespread concern among MPs, academics and doctors that the data will fall into the hands of hackers or be sold to insurers and drugs firms for use in targeting patients. NHS England, which is overseeing the scheme, says privacy will be ensured because only dates of birth, postcodes and NHS numbers will be stored. But each year more than a million medical files go missing from the Health Service – many of them lost on public transport or dumped in bins. Unless patients tell their GP in person or over the phone that they do not want to be involved in the scheme, their data will be harvested automatically. Critics say the NHS is making it deliberately difficult for patients to opt out – given how hard it is to make an appointment with a doctor or even speak to them on the phone. At least two GPs are so opposed to the scheme they have removed the thousands of patients on their books from it unless they have specifically asked to be included. One of the doctors, who is based in Oxford and is remaining anonymous for fear of reprisals, said he believed the scheme breached data protection laws. Starting today, the NHS will begin dropping leaflets through the doors of all households explaining the scheme. It is not clear whether patients will have to see their GP in person or call the surgery - it will vary between practices. There is also concern most of the public will never read them because they will be lost among junk mail. David Davis, a Tory MP and former shadow home secretary, said: 'It's an enormous threat to privacy. To make patients go in and make  an appointment with their GP is  frankly disgraceful. 'The database does have huge value for the NHS but it will go wrong. Some people's information will be lost. If hackers can take on Microsoft, how long until they get to the Department of Health?' Sarah Wollaston, a Tory MP and GP who sits on the Commons Health Select Committee, said: There's no doubt that sharing records is good for patient care. But ultimately patients own their medical records and they should decide who they share them with. Tory MP and former shadow home secretary David Davis said: 'It's an enormous threat to privacy.' 'There are some people who might want to access it, not for the best reasons, for example insurance companies.' There is concern that officials will use the data to make cuts to NHS services where they aren't deemed to be needed – such as diabetes clinics in areas where the disease is less common. Campaigners say drug firms could even use the data to raise premiums for at-risk groups. Ross Anderson, who specialises in information security at Cambridge University, accused Health Service officials of deliberate deception. He said: 'The NHS takes the view that it's our information, we'll do with it what we want. There is no effort to maintain patients' privacy.' The professor said it would be very easy for researchers, drugs firms or insurers to identify patients just by knowing their postcode and date of birth alone. Ultimately, he said it could lead to highly personal information about patients' illnesses or conditions appearing on the internet or in research papers. Phil Booth, of the campaign group Med Confidential, said the scheme was cynical and irresponsible. But Dr Geraint Lewis, who is chief data officer at NHS England, said: 'The NHS has been collecting information like this from hospitals for decades but until now we've been missing information about the quality of care provided outside hospital. 'This is about upgrading our information systems to get a more complete picture of the quality of care being delivered across all parts of the NHS and social care.' Dr Martin Scurr warned the database will 'be a honeypot for hackers' Ever since the launch of the NHS in 1948, patients have been able to rely on a principle of confidentiality – they have always been assured that their medical notes  are private. But now, for the first time, we GPs are being told to pass those notes to a third party. The records will be mined for data by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, but in future that could be passed on to researchers and even drugs firms with commercial profits in mind. We are told that all personal data will be in an ‘anonymous' form. But it will include your postcode and your NHS number. Hardly very anonymous, then. You can't tell me that this is not a breach of confidentiality. If the situation was different and a GP handed over this kind of information to a third party, and the patient found out and complained, the consequences would be severe. That complaint would be taken to the General Medical Council, and the first thing it would do would be to suspend the GP pending an investigation for a breach of professional ethics. Yet apparently it's quite all right for a government body to do this. This is really important and the public need to know about it. From today NHS England – which runs the health service – begins posting leaflets through doors explaining how and why this data is being used. Leaflets are all well and good, but what will people do with those leaflets? Some will simply bin them, mistaking them for junk mail. Doubtless there will be patients who wouldn't want their data released  but simply won't know that it is happening. If you tell your GP that you want to opt out, your details will not be released. But why should the Government decide to release this private information unless you actively take steps to stop it? Surely it should be the other way round – that people should opt in. To say that this is the thin end of the wedge is an understatement. Who's to say that confidential information you give to your GP might not be used against you in terms of health insurance? As David Davis MP rightly says, it will also be a honeypot for hackers. There may be benefits that come from researchers being able to look at this data, but we have no reason to trust the Government on this. After all, it has a particularly poor reputation when it comes to dealing with IT systems, and it is perfectly possible this data could be abused – at cataclysmic cost to the patient.","From spring, officials will begin building a giant database .

"The BBC was last night accused of suppressing an interview that called for corporation boss Rona Fairhead to resign over her £10,000-a-day second job at scandal-hit HSBC bank. It’s a new blow to Mrs Fairhead, chairman of the BBC Trust and a non-executive director of HSBC, who is facing growing calls to quit one of her high-profile jobs over claims of a conflict of interest. She is due to be questioned by MPs tomorrow after The Mail on Sunday revealed that she was paid £513,000 for just 50 days work at the troubled bank last year, vastly exceeding her £110,000 salary for what is supposed to be her main job overseeing the BBC. Last month HSBC came under fire over allegations that its Swiss banking arm helped wealthy clients dodge millions of pounds of British taxes, and that it sought to influence media coverage. Silenced: Retired businessman Michael Mason-Mahon (right) who said Rona Fairhead was not a fit and proper person to be chairwoman of the BBC Trust, will not be shown . Now an HSBC shareholder has claimed the BBC refused to broadcast an interview with him in which he declared that Mrs Fairhead was not a fit and proper person to be heading the Trust. Retired businessman Michael Mason-Mahon says he was invited to Broadcasting House in Central London to discuss the turmoil at HSBC in an on-the-record interview with a BBC business reporter on February 23. His interview failed to feature in the broadcaster’s coverage of the HSBC story that evening. He believes it was shelved because of his remarks questioning Mrs Fairhead’s fitness to run the Trust. He said: ‘I said during the interview I disagreed with her appointment as BBC Trust chairwoman. ‘I couldn’t understand why a non-executive director who is there to protect the shareholders ignored us when we told her on numerous occasions in the past about illegal behaviour that was going on involving HSBC. ‘It’s my personal belief she’s not a fit and proper person to be chairwoman of the BBC Trust. The HSBC item was shown, but my interview was not in it. I believe it may have been suppressed.’ Mr Mason-Mahon has attempted to obtain a copy of the interview but has been told that this would be against BBC policy. Mr Mason-Mahon is well-known for his outbursts at the annual general meetings of big public companies. Last May he brought a lawsuit against HSBC’s North American arm after it was fined £1.2 billion having been found guilty in 2012 of allowing Mexican drug cartels to launder money. Last week former BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland called on Mrs Fairhead either to give up her post at HSBC or to resign from the Trust. Tomorrow she is due to appear in her role as an HSBC Board member in front of the Commons public accounts committee, which has fiercely attacked tax-dodging corporations. Last night the BBC declined to say why the interview with Mr Mason-Mahon was not broadcast and whether or not Mrs Fairhead – who is not supposed to be involved in editorial decisions – was told about it. A spokesman pointed out that it was the BBC’s Panorama programme that originally broadcast the highly damaging allegations about HSBC’s Swiss banking arm and added: ‘Like every news organisation we don’t use every interview we conduct. 'It is simply wrong to suggest that we would not broadcast an interview due to it criticising someone associated with the BBC.’","Called for Rona Fairhead to resign over £10,000-a-day second job .

"Jon Huntsman couldn't help but fire a parting shot at his Republican rivals, even as he withdrew from the presidential race and backed front-runner Mitt Romney Monday morning. 'This race has degenerated into an onslaught of negative and personal attacks not worthy of the American people and not worthy of this critical time,' he said during an announcement in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Huntsman, a former Utah governor and the President Obama's ambassador to China, must now navigate the tricky waters of supporting a candidate he slammed as an unelectable, untrustworthy flip-flopper. Shortly after Huntsman told his staff . Sunday night he was planning to quit the presidential race, videos and . statements criticizing the former Massachusetts governor disappeared . from Huntsman's campaign website. Family affair: Four of Jon Huntsman's daughters, including his adopted Chinese daughter Gracie Mei, stood on stage with him and his wife Mary Kaye (in the purple) today . Exit: Jon Huntsman leaves the stage after his announcement this morning, flanked by his daughter Mary Anne (left) and his wife Mary Kaye (right) Bowing out: Huntsman's presidential bid never gained traction and floundered after a disappointing performance in New Hampshire . As an opponent, Huntsman was one of Romney's harshest critics, offering several devastating assessments of the front-runner in an attempt to win over Romney's moderate supporters. 'I will always put my country first. It . seems that Gov Romney believes in putting politics first. Gov Romney . enjoys firing people; I enjoy creating jobs. It may be that he’s . slightly out of touch with the economic reality playing out in America . right now, and that’s a dangerous place to be,' he told reporters right . before the New Hampshire primary. Lest anyone forget Huntsman's harsh words, the Democratic National Committee produced a greatest hits list of the most cutting remarks by the former candidate. Big gains: Hours after the announcement, Mitt Romney thanked Huntsman for his support and praised his campaign . Plea for unity: Flanked by his family, Huntsman criticized the divisive tone of the Republican race and said the party needs to unite . And Huntsman's endorsement of Romney was no ringing embrace. Instead, he simply cited Romney's electability. Jon Huntsman's campaign pulled down statements critical of Mitt Romney as he moved to endorse the Republican front-runner. However, the Democratic National Committee won't let Huntsman forget what he said. It has released a list of his greatest Mitt-hits: . 'I believe it is now time for our party . to unite around the candidate best equipped to defeat Barack Obama. Despite our differences I believe that candidate is Gov Mitt Romney,' Huntsman said at a news conference with his wife and children. Huntsman staked his presidential bid . on making a name for himself in last week's New Hampshire primary. But . his candidacy never really gained traction and he came in a . disappointing third place behind Romney and Texas Rep Ron Paul. Campaign sources said Huntsman was dropping out now because he didn't want to pull support away from Romney, which could prolong the GOP presidential primary. Romney gladly accepted the affirmation from his fellow Mormon. 'I salute Jon Huntsman & his wife Mary Kaye. He ran a campaign based on unity not division, & love of country. I appreciate his support,' the candidate Tweeted moments after the public announcement. Despite his low support from voters, Huntsman's departure will surely be a boon to Romney. He was only polling at three to five percent in South Carolina and Florida, the next two primary states, but he was the only candidate still competing for moderate voters who are the backbone of Romney's support. According to recent polls, nearly all of Huntsman's supporters said Romney was their second choice. This further consolidates the establishment wing of the Republican party. Conservative voters are still divided between former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and, to a lesser extent, Texas Gov Rick Perry. Huntsman is the third candidate to leave . the race. Former Minnesota Gov Tim Pawlenty exited in August and . Minnesota Rep Michele Bachmann dropped out after a poor showing in the . Iowa caucus. By his side: Huntsman made the announcement in South Carolina with his family, including his wife Mary Kaye . Waving farewell: Huntsman said he was ending his presidential bid because he believes Romney is the best choice to beat President Obama . Despite strong credentials -- an attractive, highly-educated former governor and businessman who speaks Mandarin Chinese and has extensive foreign policy experience -- Huntsman never rose above single digits in national polls. He staked his campaign on a victory, or at least a strong showing, in moderate New Hampshire. But the granite state didn't show him the love he was hoping for. He received just 17 percent of the vote compared to Mitt Romney's dominant 39 percent. Ron Paul came in second with 23 percent. New Jersey Gov Chris Christie turned down a Republican movement urging him to run for president this year, but he hasn't ruled out the possibility in the future. He told Oprah Winfrey during her visit to his home in Mendham, New Jersey, that he was considering running in 2016. 'I'll be much more ready for it four years from now than I am now,' he said. Christie says he can see his family occupying the White House in the future. The 49-year-old former US Attorney told Oprah he and his wife seriously considered the calls to run for president against Barack Obama, but ultimately he felt comfortable turning them down. 'Inside me it never felt right. I knew that if it didn't feel right, I couldn't be me,' he said.","Huntsman slammed the Republican candidates for a race that 'degenerated into an onslaught of negative and personal attacks'

"He claimed there were few vessels to enforce new regulations for UK inshore fishing waters after it leaves the EU.
And the ex-Falklands veteran, who was once a Labour security minister, said he was ""stunned"" at the government's ""amazing complacency"" over the issue.
But minister Lord Gardiner insisted a vessel monitoring system was in place.
Lord West raised the issue just days after the government announced it is to withdraw from the London Fisheries Convention - the deal which allows foreign fisherman access to British waters.
Lord Gardiner, a rural affairs minister, said the Marine Management Organisation would supervise the UK's ""exclusive economic zone"", which stretches from six to 200 nautical miles - while the Association of Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities would cover up to six nautical miles.
But he added that as the UK leaves the EU a review will be needed to reflect on the level of fisheries enforcement required.
That response prompted Lord West to say: ""This simple sailor is absolutely stunned by the answer, which shows amazing complacency.
""The bottom line is we have very, very few vessels involved in this. They are not properly centrally coordinated. We've already seen a number of the countries involved saying 'well to hell with what you're saying, we're coming there anyway'.
""We will be made a laughing stock if we apply some rules and cannot enforce them.""
Lord West urged ministers to establish ""a centralised command system to actually control the various assets we have"", adding that ""far too few of them seem to be able to focus on things like someone fishing illegally in the six to 12 mile zones"".
He said more ships and boats needed to be built ""to ensure we can actually enforce it"".
The minister said he would like Lord West, who served in the Royal Navy between 1965 and 2006, to go with him to Newcastle to see a new digital vessel monitoring system that can pinpoint ""every vessel that's at sea within our waters"".
He said there were three offshore patrol vessels in operation, with a further five new river offshore patrol vessels being built that will be used for fisheries protection.
But Labour's rural affairs spokeswoman Baroness Jones of Whitchurch argued that ""fish stocks can't be managed unilaterally"", adding ""there has to be some cooperation with neighbouring countries"".
""Fish shoals can sometimes move for hundreds of miles, and indeed our own fishermen fish up to the north of Russia and southern Portugal,"" she said.
""There's no point in making a unilateral declaration.""
But Lord Gardiner said not only would the government be negotiating ""with our partners and friends in Europe so we have a sustainable fishing industry"" but post-Brexit the UK will ""have the ability to decide who fishes in our waters"".
He said the chief executive of National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations had welcomed the UK's decision to give notice to the London Fisheries Convention as ""an important part of establishing the UK as an independent coastal state with sovereignty over its own exclusive economic zone"".
He said fishing is worth Â£1.3bn to the UK economy, employs 34,600 people, has 6,000 fishing vessels and lands 708 tonnes of fish each year worth Â£775m.
The government would be ""very conscious"" of the interests of the coastal and fishing communities of the UK, he added.","The UK will be a ""laughing stock"" in Europe if it cannot police its fishing waters after Brexit, former First Sea Lord Admiral Lord West has said."
"Justin Welby made the announcement after a meeting of primates from the Anglican Communion in Canterbury.
In the UK, an act of Parliament passed in 1928 allowed for Easter Sunday to be fixed on the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April.
However, this has never been activated and Easter has remained variable, determined by the moon's cycle.
Easter is the most important Christian festival, as it celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ following his death by crucifixion on Good Friday.
The archbishop said he was in talks with Pope Francis, Coptic leader Pope Tawadros, and the leader of the Orthodox church Patriarch Bartholomew.
Mr Welby said he hoped the change would happen ""in between five and 10 years time"".
""I would love to see it before I retired"", he said, although he warned the first attempt to make such a change was in the 10th Century.
An Anglican source told the BBC there had been 15 attempts to agree a common date since then.
Easter is on the first Sunday after the first ecclesiastical full moon following the spring equinox, meaning it can be celebrated on a Sunday between 22 March and 25 April.
But the Orthodox church follows the Julian calendar, hence has later Easter celebrations compared with those of Western Christianity.
In 1990, the Vatican approved a proposal for a fixed date, which was subject to agreement with other Christian churches and governments. It has not yet been reached.",The Archbishop of Canterbury is working with other Christian churches to agree on a fixed date for Easter.
"It carries out a monthly survey of firms that tracks indicators such as new orders, employment and exports.
The latest report for April suggested a modest deterioration in business conditions, as output and new orders declined following growth in March.
That was the fourth monthly decline in activity in the last five months.
Ulster Bank's chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said Northern Ireland's modest decline in private sector activity compares with growth in all of the other UK regions.
Manufacturing continued to be a bright spot, with output growth and new orders rebounding to a 6-month high, driven by market demand in Great Britain.
By contrast, Northern Ireland retailers reported their sharpest decline in retail sales since May 2012 and the construction sector posted its largest fall in business activity in two years.
Mr Ramsey said that despite the apparent weakness suggested by the results, companies are continuing to hire staff.
""Despite uncertainty and lack of demand, local firms saw their staffing levels rise in April at the fastest rate in seven months. Employment growth was reported across all sectors with the exception of construction,"" he added.
Looking forward, he said that the detail of the new Conservative government's fiscal plans and economic policies ""will affect all sectors of the economy both public and private"".","The recovery in Northern Ireland's private sector has been ""effectively stalled"" since November, research by the Ulster Bank has suggested."
"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The super-yachts of the super-rich could soon become super-green. The solar sail: super-yachts could cut fuel consumption and emissions by using a sail similar to this. Sydney-based technology company Solar Sailor is working on a ""solar sail"" which could act as both a sail and a solar power source to all sorts of large vessels. Super-yachts owned by billionaires like Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen are currently among the biggest fuel guzzlers on the planet. Some of the ocean-going beasts like Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's ""Dubai,"" the biggest private super-yacht in the world, are over 150 meters long and contain amenities like aircraft hangars, movie theaters, Jacuzzis, and swimming pools. All of these features sap incredible amounts of energy. Fuel consumption estimates on super-yachts have ranged up to one liter of fuel per second when traveling at high power. • See a photo gallery of the world's best super-yachts . Solar Sailor's CEO Robert Dane told CNN the technology could work perfectly with super-yachts. He said the solar sails had the ability to significantly reduce the boats' fuel consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions. ""We think it would enable people to have their super-yacht but make little or no carbon footprint, which is the big problem with these vessels,"" he said. Dane said the technology worked by using a wing that is a solar panel or a sail, pivotally mounted to a vessel so it can be angled to the sun or the wind. The ""sails"" are controlled by a computer which takes into account the direction and strength of sun and wind to optimize energy collection. A design project is currently underway in the United Kingdom to create a solar sail for the super-yachts, he said. Dane said the company was working with Chinese shipping company COSCO to get solar sails on some of its fleet. ""Our aim is for a trail of retrofitted sails to one bulker and one tanker in 2010. Based on the results of this, then we would design 'new-build' vessels,"" he said. Dane estimated the sail could save about 5 percent in fuel consumption from the solar power and another 20 to 40 percent from wind power when the vessel is traveling at 18 knots. ""This might add up to a 10 percent saving overall in the whole journey,"" Dane said. He said there were further hopes that the technology could be improved by developing systems to raise and lower sails with fewer moving parts and store energy more efficiently.","Solar sails are large solar-paneled wings which can harness sun or wind power .
Sydney-based company Solar Sailor is developing the technology .
The solar sails could be fixed to super-yachts to help reduce their fuel consumption ."
"Washington (CNN) -- Within hours of President Barack Obama's announcement that Osama bin Laden had been killed, politics entered the fray. A small but vocal group of Republicans including former Bush administration officials began claiming that information obtained from waterboarding and other now-prohibited enhanced interrogation techniques led to the successful assault on bin Laden's compound in Pakistan. Debate rages about role of torture . Interviews and commentaries by conservatives, including former Vice President Dick Cheney repeated the contention, citing media reports rather than direct information. A closer look shows no obvious evidence of a direct connection, at least to waterboarding, the simulated drowning technique considered to be torture under international law. While administration officials, former interrogators and others concede that thousands of pieces of information collected over the past nine years eventually brought U.S. Navy SEALs to bin Laden, no one has cited specific information that came from the harsh interrogations labeled torture. That doesn't stop defenders of enhanced interrogations from trying. Republican Rep. Peter King, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said that waterboarding alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed caused him to eventually provide information on the al Qaeda courier killed with bin Laden in the raid. Was bin Laden's killing legal? Mohammed was captured in 2003, and another high-value suspect, Abu Faraj al Libi, was captured in 2005. ""I think it's fair to say that it's a long way to getting bin Laden, but the first step along that road began with the intense interrogation"" of Mohammed and al Libi, King said. However, as CNN Senior Political Analyst Gloria Borger reported Wednesday, Central Intelligence Agency operatives already knew the courier's nickname when they interrogated Mohammed and al Libi. According to Borger's report, the detainee who initially provided the courier's nickname may have been subjected to harsh interrogation, but not waterboarding. Later, Mohammed lied to his interrogators about the courier, who was described as his protege, and intelligence personnel concluded that the courier was important because Mohammed was trying to cover for him, a senior U.S. official said. U.S. intelligence eventually uncovered the courier's identity four years ago ""from a different part of the world,"" the senior U.S. official said. Trail to bin Laden started with courier . King argued that Mohammed only talked after being waterboarded, and even though he lied about the courier, the fact he talked at all showed the value of waterboarding. To Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough, no such connection exists. ""This whole idea about somehow whether EITs (enhanced interrogation techniques) played into that, I think, is just not consistent with the facts, and, also, a little bit of a sideshow, as far as I'm concerned,"" McDonough said. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Wednesday that locating bin Laden required years of painstaking work that eventually led to discovery of the address of the Pakistan compound last August. ""I can say with certainty that no single piece of information, with the exception of the address of the compound, was ... singularly vital to this, because we're talking about tiny bits of information that were compiled by unbelievably competent professionals over nine and a half years,"" Carney said. ""And it's impossible to know if one piece of information came from one source and was corroborated in another way; if, you know which thread held the cloth together, with the exception of the location of the compound."" Carney acknowledged that some information came from terrorism detainees, which he called one of many ways that information was gathered. ""Now, I can't categorically rule out that one piece of information"" played a key role, ""because we don't know,"" Carney said. Mark Fallon, a former interrogator at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, terrorist detention facility, rejected claims that enhanced interrogation techniques led to bin Laden's capture. ""I think some people are trying to rewrite history here,"" Fallon told MSNBC, adding that he was privy to information from Mohammed and wasn't aware ""of any substantive information or intelligence that was a derivative product of waterboarding."" One of Obama's first acts as president was to halt waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques of the Bush administration. The issue was one of the most contentious of the Bush presidency, with critics accusing the administration of legalizing torture while supporters called the enhanced interrogations necessary for combating terrorism. Now, those who were under fire for the interrogation policies are claiming vindication and calling for their return. John Yoo, a Bush administration lawyer who wrote the memo justifying the enhanced techniques, said in a posting Monday on the National Review website that the policy had worked. However, his posting only cited media reports based on anonymous sources, rather than any specific information gleaned from interrogated detainees. Marc Thiessen, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, made similar assertions on the group's website, but began his commentary by attributing his information to news reports. Cheney, interviewed on ABC and Fox, said he assumed enhanced interrogation techniques played a role in bin Laden's demise, but added he had no proof. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that information was key to the fight against terrorism. ""Now let's remember that in the early days, we knew very little about how al Qaeda operated and the roundup of their field generals like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed led us not just to learn that there was a courier -- I remember when they learned there was a courier who might be a link to Osama bin Laden -- but we also learned from those people about the structure of al Qaeda,"" Rice said. However, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she was unaware of any information eventually leading to bin Laden's location that ""came as a result of harsh interrogation practices."" Two conservative senators -- Republicans John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina -- also rejected the claim that waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation played a role in finding bin Laden. ""This idea -- we caught Bin Laden because of waterboarding -- I think is a misstatement,"" Graham said, citing instead the years of difficult intelligence work. ""I do not believe this is a time to celebrate waterboarding. I believe this is a time to celebrate hard work."" CNN's Gloria Borger contributed to this story.","Conservatives say Bush-era policies are vindicated .
Democrats reject that any valuable intel came from waterboarding .
The White House emphasizes years of tracking down countless leads ."
"The party won 10 seats, but the Conservatives have retained control with 45 out of 78 councillors.
The Tories had 51 seats before Thursday's vote, while the Liberal Democrats slipped from 24 to 17.
Labour's seats increased from one to four, while two independent councillors were also elected.
Former cabinet minister Mr Huhne, a Lib Dem, was jailed in March for perverting the course of justice, and his party lost both Eastleigh council seats to UKIP.
One of UKIP's gains was in South Waterside where Philip Fawkes, a distant relative of Guy Fawkes, was elected.

It's been an historic night in the local elections - with UKIP winning its first seats on county councils in the south.
As soon as the votes came tumbling out of the ballot boxes in Hampshire it became clear that it was going to be a tough night for the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.
Labour gained three seats - but it was UKIP's supporters who had the biggest smiles. They started the night with no seats on the county council - but they ended up with 10.
Across Hampshire, there were losses for the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives - but the Tories retain control of the county council.
One senior Conservative MP says the UKIP surge should prompt the prime minister to deliver stronger policies on immigration and Europe.
Conservative Alexis McEvoy criticised her own party's national leadership after losing her South Waterside seat to Mr Fawkes.
She said Tory leaders ""choose not to listen to what the public are saying"", which boosted the UKIP vote.
""I hope the government will listen because they never do,"" she added.
""They're arrogant, out of touch and because of them good councillors have now been lost.""
Andy Moore, 53, who won Eastleigh East for UKIP, said: ""We have told the truth. We have listened to the public who have put us in these positions as councillors.""
Martin Lyon, 47, who took nearby Bishopstoke and Fair Oak for UKIP, added: ""I'm just shell shocked.
""It's all about the people on the ground. There have been a lot of people who have put the work in over five to 10 years in Eastleigh.""
Lib Dem Sandra Gidley, who lost to Conservative Roy Perry in Romsey Extra, said she was disappointed but her stronger feeling was one of concern about the gains made by UKIP.
""It's a protest vote, it's a dangerous one; nobody knows what that party stands for,"" she said.
""It's now down to all politicians to try and reconnect with the public because what was clear to me is that the public have lost faith in all of us from all parties; that's why UKIP did well, not because they have anything to offer.""

"It will cost Crystal Palace £10million for them to convert Wilfried Zaha's loan switch from Manchester United into a permanent one. The 22-year-old left Selhurst Park in January 2013 but has returned to his former club on loan after failing to make an impression under both David Moyes and Louis van Gaal at United. The Eagles are reportedly working on a transfer window deal  that would see them pay a flat £3million fee, plus £3m in add-ons to United if the triggers are met - and the loss of £4m in add-ons written off in the original deal which saw Zaha leave for Old Trafford.

"Windsor's Theatre Royal was celebrating the opening night of One Man, Two Guvnors on Tuesday evening.
But theatre-goers were swiftly removed after flash-flooding caused water to halt the performance.
The theatre director Robert Miles said the auditorium had since been dried out and Wednesday night's show would continue as planned.
Sue Salmon, who was in the auditorium when the theatre was evacuated, said: ""Water was just pouring under the doors down towards the stage.""
The play, performed by the Windsor Repertory Company, is part of a six-week festival celebrating 201 years of theatre in the Berkshire town.
The flood happened after heavy rainfall on Tuesday, which also caused havoc in London where some people were trapped in cars by flash flooding.
Mr Miles said: ""Nothing like this has happened to us before, we've had the occasional flood as we've been here 100 years.
""All of a sudden water started coming through from the back of the building and it didn't take long for it to get into the auditorium.""
Wendy Sammes went to see the play with her daughter. She said: ""It was a horrific storm, you could hear the thunder and lightning in the theatre.
""We suddenly saw people standing up [in the front stalls] and were evacuated.""",Hundreds of people had to be evacuated from a theatre mid-performance after water came gushing into the auditorium.
"By . Suzannah Hills . PUBLISHED: . 02:50 EST, 19 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:25 EST, 19 September 2013 . Former IRA commander Martin McGuinness has described the death of two boys killed by one of the terror group's bombs as 'shameful' during a peace lecture in the town where it happened. Three-year-old Johnathan Ball and 12-year-old Tim Parry were both killed by bombs planted by the IRA in Warrington on March 20, 1993. Mr McGuinness yesterday visited the town after being invited by Tim Parry's father to speak at a peace foundation named in his son's memory. Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness described the deaths of IRA bomb victims Tim Parry and Johnathan Ball as 'shamful' during a talk at the Peace Centre in Warrington . Victims: Tim Parry, 12, (left) and three-year-old Johnathan Ball (right) were both killed by the Warrington bombs . A small band of around 12 demonstrators . stood outside the venue last night protesting at Mr McGuinness' speech . at the Tim Parry - Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace. Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine, . 18, was killed in the Birmingham pub bombings, compared Mr McGuinness' giving a talk on peace to 'asking Myra Hindley to give a talk on child . protection'. Before the speech, Mr McGuinness said that he 'understood' the objections and described the path to peace as a 'journey'. 'My heart goes out to them because they . too are people that have suffered as a result of the conflict in the . north of Ireland,' he said. 'I fully appreciate that there are other people who don't feel able to make that journey. I would be the last to criticise them. 'My heart goes out to all the victims of the conflict. I feel very compassionate to all of them. 'We need to be sorry for everything that happened with the people involved in the conflict.' Mr McGuinness was invited to speak at the centre by Tim Parry's father, Colin, pictured left with the minister . Meeting: Colin Parry, pictured left with his wife Wendy and Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, said that history is littered with terrorists who went on to become peace-makers . Martin McGuinness has gone from former IRA second in command to mainstream politician who shook hands with the Queen. Born in 1950, he joined the Provisional IRA as a teenager and quickly rose up the ranks. By 1971, aged 21, he was second in command of the IRA in Derry. He held that position at the time of Bloody Sunday, when 14 civil rights protesters were killed by British paratroopers in the city. During the Saville Inquiry into the events of that day, Paddy Ward claimed McGuinness had personally handed him bomb parts, an allegation McGuinness claimed was 'fantasy'. In 1973, he was convicted by Ireland's Special Criminal Court, after being caught with a car  loaded with explosives and ammunition. He refused to recognise the court, and was sentenced to six months imprisonment. He has also been accused of attending the interrogation of British government informer Frank Hegarty, whom he allegedly encouraged to return to Derry where he was murdered. He has always denied those allegations. However, he has never denied his role in the IRA, and has said: ‘I didn’t say I never fired a gun – I was in the IRA. There were battles on the streets of Derry.' However, when asked if he had killed anyone, he answered no. He claims he left the Provisionals in 1974 to pursue a career in politics. As a member of Sinn Fein, he was elected to Parliament at Westminster in 1997 - although he never took up his seat. He was the political party's chief negotiator when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998 and was later Education Minister after the Northern Ireland Assembly was set-up. Since 2007 he has been the deputy first minister. In 2012, he shook hands with the Queen almost 33 years after her cousin, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, was murdered by an IRA bomb. The gesture of mutual acceptance and acknowledgement was an astonishing act of forgiveness by the 86-year-old monarch who adored her ‘Uncle Dickie’. During his speech, McGuinness told of his own and Ulster's journey to peace and his hopes for the future, adding: 'I was once in the IRA. I am now a peace builder. It has been a journey which has involved much hurt and pain. 'I have followed many coffins and stood beside many grieving families in the years since. 'But there can be no greater tragedy in life than parents having to bury their child.' He added: 'Regrettably the past cannot be changed or undone. Neither can the suffering, the hurt or the violence of the conflict be disowned by Republicans or any other party to the conflict.' Mr Parry said while he has not forgiven . the IRA for the bombing, history was 'littered' with terrorists who had . now become peace-makers. He added that the foundation had an 'open door' policy and their founding principle was that all opinions from opposing sides of conflicts were welcome in the pursuit of peace. 'I would hope that the people outside, rather than criticise us for that, would recognise that's a different path but an honourable path,' he said. Tim and Johnathan were killed when bombs planted in litter bins in the town's main shopping area were detonated shortly after midday on a sunny Saturday afternoon. No warning was given and no one has been prosecuted for the attack on March 20 1993, that left 56 people injured. Johnathan, three, was in the town with his babysitter to buy a card for Mother's Day, the next day, when he was killed. Tim, . an Everton fan, had been shopping for football shorts when he caught . the full force of the explosion. He died in his father's arms five days . later in Liverpool's Walton Hospital. The death of the two boys sparked a public outcry in the UK and on both sides of the border in Ireland. Mr . Parry and Tim's mother, Wendy Parry, have set up the Tim Parry . Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace, which has since become an . internationally recognised centre for conflict resolution and victim . support. One of the protesters outside the . venue was Brian Hambleton, 58, who dropped off his sister Maxine at the . Birmingham pub blasted by IRA bombs on the evening of November 21, 1974. Mr Hambleton, from Birmingham, said: 'It makes me feel ill being within 100 yards of him. I'm here for a reason and that reason is that man's murky, violent past. 'He has to be answerable for his past before he goes forward with peace. He shouldn't be speaking in there, he should be on his knees begging people's forgiveness. 'This . town lost two beautiful young boys like I lost my sister. How Mr Parry . can greet him and invite him here is beyond me. It is immoral.'

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 11:49 PM on 30th November 2011 . The Dow Jones today closed up almost 500 points in an astonishing rally after the world’s major central banks announced a desperate move to kick-start the global financial system. The operation, led by the U.S. Federal Reserve, came amid fears that at least one major European bank . may be teetering on the brink of collapse. The dramatic move to shore up the world's creaking economy was undermined after the credit ratings agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded its . ratings on 15 global banks by one notch. All smiles: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange before the closing bell this afternoon . Cheered by traders: A view of a board on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, as the Dow shot up . The central banks of Europe, the U.S. and others agreed to give banks cheaper access to loans in U.S. dollars, which aims to avert a credit crisis like the one after Lehman . Brothers collapsed in 2008. The . Dow jumped 490 points in its biggest gain since March 2009 - rising 4.2 . per cent to close at 12,045. The S&P was up 52 points to 1,245; and . the Nasdaq jumped 105 points to 2,620. This move, akin to interest rate cuts, gives credit markets extra liquidity by effectively providing banks with unlimited U.S. dollars to fund themselves. 'Cutting swap costs is the equivalent of interest rate cuts. The banks will be hoping this is a turning point in the crisis,' economist Jeremy Cook said. But last night John Higgins, . of the Capital Economics research consultancy, . said the central banks’ intervention would provide temporary relief for . Europe, but warned that it was ‘not a game changer’. He added: ‘Welcome . as the news was, we do not think it signals a turning point in the . crisis.’ In a bleak assessment of the crisis engulfing Europe, a UK government spokesman said: ‘We are experiencing a credit crunch.’ The surprise plan was aimed at preventing global financial markets from coming under pressure that could potentially lead to a seizing up of credit. For November, the Dow edged up 0.76 per . cent, but the S&P fell 0.50 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite . dropped 2.39 per cent overall. Gesture: Specialist Michael McDonnell, right, works with traders on the floor of the stock exchange today . Huge increase: The Dow jumped 490 points in its biggest gain since March 2009 - rising 4.2 per cent . The Federal Reserve has joined with other central banks to kick-start the global economy. They want to make it easier for banks to get dollars when needed and avert a credit crunch. Non-U.S. banks need dollars to fund American operations and make dollar loans to firms. But banks are afraid to lend because nobody is sure who holds bad government debt. If a European government defaults then it will probably put the U.S. back into recession, so it is in everyone's interests to avoid this. The central banks will reduce the cost of temporary dollar loans offered to banks - called liquidity swaps - to a half percentage point. The Fed noted banks were not having difficulty now getting funds in short-term markets - but it still has a ‘range of tools’ for use as a backstop. Britain’s FTSE closed up 3.2 per cent to 5,505, the DAX in Germany was up 5 per cent to 6,089 and France’s CAC was up 4.2 per cent to 3,155. Traders said the move recalled the co-ordinated action to steady global markets that was taken during the 2008 financial crisis. Economist Mark Cliffe said policymakers are ‘beginning to address the problem’. He stated there was a ‘very dark mood’ developing last week. Mr Cliffe added that policymakers must step in with ‘aggressive measures’ and begin to ‘confront the financing problems of the sovereigns’. Other economists welcomed the move but warned that a lot of work remains to deal with the underlying sovereign debt crisis. Variations: This is a colour-coded table of credit ratings of euro zone nations, as well as the U.S. and Japan .

Silvio Perruzzo said 'the ECB has more scope to go' and it is expected to announce more measures in its next policy meeting on December 8. 'Cutting swap costs is the equivalent of interest rate cuts. The banks will be hoping this is a turning point in the crisis'Jeremy Cook . 'Doing more on the collateral side is probably the second step. The ECB is helping the banking system while sovereigns do their homework,' he said. The shock agreement came as European Union finance ministers met in Brussels to discuss radical plans to address the debt crisis. It could see member states handing over control of their finances. Leaders have been warned they have 10 days to complete a crisis response. Euro zone ministers agreed detailed . plans to leverage the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSF), but . warned they may have to turn to the IMF for more help to avert . financial disaster.

Olli Rehn, Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner, said: 'We are now entering the critical period of 10 days to complete and conclude the crisis response of the European Union.' Italian and Spanish bond yields resumed . their inexorable climb towards unsustainable levels on today, as markets . assessed the rescue fund boost as inadequate. 'We are now entering the critical period of 10 days to complete and conclude the crisis response of the European Union' Olli Rehn . It comes as stock markets rose after buoyant consumer confidence figures renewed optimism in the strength of the U.S. economy. Europe's ongoing battle to contain its debt crisis will remain a key driver in markets for a while to come, especially if countries continue having to pay elevated interest rates to get investors to lend to them. Italy was yesterday forced to pay a high interest rate on an auction of three-year debt. The 7.89 per cent rate was nearly three percentage points higher than last month. If Italy was to default on its debt of 1.9 trillion euros, the fallout would damage the euro and send shock waves throughout the global economy.","Dow Jones surges as Wall Street markets jump more than four per cent .

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 08:16 EST, 13 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:20 EST, 13 February 2013 . The discovery of a vital ingredient for fertiliser under the North York Moors has prompted a 'gold rush' as people race to invest in a company that plans to mine it. A massive deposit of polyhalite – a mineral which contains potash, essential for fertiliser - has sparked thousands of people snapping up shares in the Sirius Minerals, which plans to mine the reserve. In January the firm applied for planning permission to construct the pithead in the North York Moors National Park, a conservation area. The potash mine has promised new jobs, but some locals fear the development will destroy the tranquility of the park . The firm maintains it is the only place it could be done, and would not be intrusive as barely any of the machinery will be seen, according to the Financial Times. They say the shaft will be underground, and have chosen an area ion high ground with a forest plantation to shield it and not ruin the view. The £1.1bn project is expected to create 1,000 jobs and there are 4,225 shareholders in Yorkshire and Teesside - which together own nine per cent of Sirius, according to the newspaper. Since December thousands of shares have been bought by people eager to cash in on the mucky mine of th emineral. The North York Moors, near Whitby, has a rich reserve of potash - an essential mineral for fertiliser . The park's local HSBC bank has had customers regularly coming in to purchase shares in the Aim-listed company, such is the eagerness to profit from the discovery. The project includes a 27-mile (43km) underground pipeline to transport the potash ore from North Yorkshire to Teesside. The company said the pipeline was the most environmentally acceptable solution for moving the ore, as it will significantly cut the amount of traffic transporting the deposit. The name stems from 'pot ash', the process used before the industrial revolution of soaking plant ashes in a pot to draw out potassium carbonate, that was left in a white ash. Potash is the common term for fertiliser forms of the element potassium (K). The mineral is the 7th most common element in the earth's crust and is an essential ingredient for fertiliser. Chris Fraser, managing director and chief executive of Sirius Minerals, said the project would create 'significant new jobs' and improve local skills 'for generations to come'. But some neighbours are dismayed at the plans, saying the mine will destroy the tranquility of the beautiful area, the BBC reported. The moors are renowned for their stunning, peaceful character, and tourism jobs are vital for the area's economy. The National Park Authority plans to hold public meetings as part of a consultation process, and a decision on the proposal is expected in May. The authority said it would assess the potential economic benefits and the environmental impacts of the mine before reaching any decision.","Investors race to snap up shares in company that wants to mine reserve .

"Since independence from Britain in 1970, rivalry between the indigenous Fijian and the ethnic Indian communities has been at the root of much of the political upheaval in the country.

President: Jioji Konousi Konrote
Jioji Konousi Konrote was elected as president in October 2015. He is the first non-indigenous president and the first to be elected by parliament. Previous presidents were selected by the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC).
He has had a long career in the military, government and diplomatic service.
Prime Minister: Josaia Voreqe ""Frank"" Bainimarama
Former military leader Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama was sworn in as prime minister in September 2014, eight years after overthrowing the government of Laisenia Qarase in a bloodless coup, accusing it of corruption and a bias towards ethnic Fijians.
An indigenous Fijian born in 1954, Mr Bainimarama has long championed equal rights for the country's minority ethnic Indian community. More commonly known as Frank, he is sometimes referred to with the title Ratu to denote his heritage as a chief.
Since the introduction of the government's Media Decree in 2012, the Fiji Media Industry Development Authority controls what is published by the media industry. Media organizations and journalists face harsh penalties for publishing material not in the public interest. This has led to a degree of self censorship.
Some key dates in Fiji's history:
1643 - Dutch explorer Abel Tasman is the first European to visit the islands.
1970 - Independence after a century of British rule.
1987 - The first of two coups overthrows the Indian majority government of Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra.
1999 - Mahendra Chaudhry is elected Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister but is overthown a year later.
2014 - Former military leader Frank Bainimarama is elected prime minister, eight years after seizing power in a coup.","Fiji is one of the most developed economies in the Pacific, relying heavily on its tourism and sugar industries."
"The decision was taken after one of the students, 17-year-old Ruby Rai, told a local media channel that political science was about cooking.
Video of the interview with her and other students went viral in India.
Last year, parents of students in the state were photographed climbing school walls to pass on answers.
The embarrassed state government had announced tough measures like fines and jail terms intended to curb cheating this year.
The markedly lower pass rate seen in the results announced last week was taken as an indication that the steps had worked.
That is, of course, until the footage of arts student Ruby Rai's interview was aired.
The government said that her result, as well as that of Saurabh Shrestha who came first in science and was unable to answer a simple chemistry question, had been suspended with immediate effect.
The two students, along with 12 others who excelled in the examinations, will now have to appear for a written test and interview before a panel of subject experts on 3 June, Bihar examinations chairman Lalkeshwar Prasad Singh told Indian media.
Their handwriting will also be checked to verify if they answered their own questions, he said.","Fourteen students who topped school leaving exams in India's Bihar state will be retested amid concerns they cheated, the state government has said."
"But the chancellor said there must be ""business as usual, life as normal"" for Britons as the UK left the EU.
""Many things would look similar"" the day after Brexit - on 29 March 2019 - as the UK moved gradually towards a new relationship with the EU, he said.
The EU has said it is too soon to discuss a transitional deal.
A European Commission spokesman said: ""We are about to discuss the specifics of separation and once this is done to the satisfaction of everyone, we may move to the second step.""
The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019 but there has been increasing talk of a ""transitional"" or ""implementation"" stage to smooth the process, before a new long-term relationship with the EU comes into force.
This could mean a period during which some EU rules would continue to apply to the UK after it has technically left the bloc. Newspaper reports have suggested these could include the free movement of people, something that was seen as a key issue in the vote to leave the EU.
Mr Hammond also appeared to acknowledge that it could mean new trade deals with non-EU countries could not be signed during that period.
The chancellor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the length of any transitional deal would ""be driven by technical considerations"".
Beneath the surface, Chancellor Philip Hammond had been arguing for a transitional arrangement to avoid choppy waters in 2019. There is no longer any dissent in the ranks - that concept has been agreed by the Cabinet.
In return, the chancellor has acceded to demands by ministers who voted to leave the EU that any transitional phase must be completed by the scheduled date of the next general election - June 2022.
But have other disagreements so far escaped the political sonar?

On Thursday, immigration minister Brandon Lewis said it was a ""simple matter of fact"" that EU free movement rules would not apply after 2019.
Mr Hammond said this was correct because freedom of movement was an EU concept and the UK would leave the customs union and single market on 29 March 2019.
But he said the question that needed answering was what happened next, so that British people and businesses could ""get on with their lives"" without ""massive disruption"".
He said he hoped that, in the immediate aftermath, goods would ""continue to flow across the border between the UK and the EU in much the same way as they do now"".
On whether EU citizens would continue to be free to enter the UK, he said it would be ""some time before we are able to introduce full migration controls between the UK and the European Union"".
""That's not a matter of political choice, it's a matter of fact. We have to put in place quite a lot of new infrastructure, we will need a lot of new people, we will need new IT systems... This is going to take a while to deliver.""
He said Britons wanted to know they would still be able to ""go about their business"" after March 2019, from buying European goods to going off on holiday, adding: ""The government's job is to make sure that our economy can go on functioning normally, that people can go about their businesses as usual... that is our focus.""
Some of Mr Hammond's colleagues who campaigned for a Leave vote have accepted that an ""implementation period"" after Brexit is likely.
The Conservative MP and Leave campaigner Nigel Evans said any transition period should end as soon as the UK had arrangements in place, saying: ""This is not going to be seen as a ruse whereby some people who might have liked us to remain in the European Union can see this as an opportunity to keep us half in.
""That's not going to happen. We are, in all but one or two transitional arrangements, going to have left the European Union by March 2019.""
Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Labour had been calling for ""appropriate transitional arrangements"" which the chancellor ""now appears to accept"".
""However, in light of the clear divisions this week within the Cabinet, I hope the chancellor was not merely speaking in a personal capacity,"" he said.
""I also hope that this is the final burial of the flawed proposition that 'no deal' is a viable option.""
Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said a transition period was only ""kicking the can down the road"".
""All the problems associated with a hard Brexit, leaving the single market, leaving the customs union, they will simply be confronted two years later.""
Meanwhile, Malta's PM Joseph Muscat has said he is ""starting to believe that Brexit will not happen"", according to the Guardian.","Any ""transitional deal"" in the period after Brexit must end by June 2022, the time of the next general election, Philip Hammond has said."

"About 30 people had been living in tents on St Peter's Square, outside the Central Library, since 15 April.
Manchester City Council had been issued a warrant to close the camp, with campaigners losing an appeal.
The demonstrators have now set up another settlement about half a mile away, in St Anne's Square.
Police and bailiffs arrived at about 08:00 BST to break up the St Peter's Square camp.
Some protesters packed up their tents and equipment and left the area peacefully, but others resisted.
Campaigners said they wanted to highlight a crisis in temporary housing and the plight of homeless people.
The council said some demonstrators had been behaving ""entirely inappropriately"" in a public area.
Deputy Leader of Manchester City Council Bernard Priest said: ""While it is entirely legitimate to raise concerns about homelessness, there have been issues with offensive graffiti and other forms of vandalism, fighting, public urination, street drinking, litter and loud music being played.
""The camp has now cost the council and Greater Manchester Police more than Â£88,000 in additional policing, security and legal costs. In the current climate, this is not an extra cost any public body can shoulder lightly.
""Over the last month, our homelessness service has provided support and advice to more than 20 members of the camp - as they work regularly with other homeless people across the city - and officers were present prior to and during the eviction to provide accommodation to anyone willing to accept it.""",Homeless protesters who have camped out in Manchester city centre for more than a month have been moved on by police and bailiffs.

Mrs May had accused PCs of treating the public with 'contempt' and threatened to overhaul the way they ran themselves if they did not sort themselves out. Her controversial speech to the Police Federation conference in Bournemouth yesterday sparked a furious response from rank and file officers. But Mr Herbert slammed the police's reaction and accused one senior former policeman of using the foul term to describe Mrs May. Nick Herbert sparked controversy after swearing on the BBC's Daily Politics TV show. Presenter Jo Coburn was forced to apologise for his behaviour and warn him not to repeat the slur. Mr Herbert MP was defending Theresa May's  speech to the Police Federation conference in Bournemouth when he quoted a vile attack on the Home Secretary by a senior former detective . After using the word  on the BBC's live Daily Politics programme, hosted by Andrew Neil, Mr Herbert was inundated with complaints and the BBC was forced to apologised for the remark. The Conservative MP was criticising some police officers’ 'infantile' response to the Home Secretary's speech yesterday.. He said: 'I am afraid there have been a minority who have been outspoken and they are very active on twitter and I saw Peter [Kirkham – former detective chief inspector] himself yesterday described the Home Secretary as a ‘f*ckwit’ in his own twitter line. 'Indeed we should not have any more of it from either police officers or former police officers - this kind of infantile discussion that goes on. What we need is a serious discussion about how policing has got to adapt to today’s age and the things that need to be done to sort out the problems that we have seen.' He later defended his actions and pointed out that he used the term 'disapprovingly'. But presenter Jo Coburn interrupted Mr Herbert, telling him 'we won't have any more of that' and cautioning him to speak 'without repeating any of those expletives'. Mr Herbert responded: 'Indeed we should not have any more of it, from either police officers or former police officers, this kind of infantile discussion that goes on.' The Home Secretary launched a furious assault on the police yesterday - accusing them of treating the public with 'contempt' At the end of the programme Ms Coburn offered a full apology for the outburst, saying it was unacceptable and would not be repeated. Explaining his actions on Twitter following the broadcast, Mr Herbert said: 'Shame on the former police officer on the prog who used the word to describe the Home Sec and who I was quoting disapprovingly.' A BBC spokeswoman said: 'Daily Politics is a live programme and, as with any live broadcast, occasionally slip-ups may happen. We apologised to viewers immediately for any offence caused.' A number of people expressed their disapproval on Twitter that such language was used on a daytime political discussion. Mr Kirkham later appeared to dispute having used the term, posting a message which said: 'Genuinely don't recall doing so 'a couple of days ago'!' Labour MP Liz Kendall was among those to condemn the bad language, saying on Twitter: 'My dad is constituent of Nick Herbert. Very unhappy at reports of his comments on Daily Politics. Completely inappropriate, especially for an MP.' Greater Manchester Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy pleader for a truce in the war of words between Theresa May and the police . Mr Herbert was attacking the Police Federation's response to Mrs May's brutal assault on their record. He said the organisation, which represents rank and file officers, had been a 'terrible advert' for British policing and welcomed, what he described as, their reluctant acceptance of the changes proposed at conference. 'I think there is this continuing problem that there is an element within the Police Federation that hasn’t understood the importance of policing needing to change and the Federation itself needing to change. 'The Federation has been a terrible advert for policing; the behaviour of its members during the conferences, which has been often boorish even drunken; the way in which they refuse to embrace any kind of discussion about the police service, has to do with a lot of the problems that it has confronted. 'There have been string of problems and they have got to be addressed. The Home Secretary listed all of those. It’s not representative, it’s not diverse, there are very few women there, there are certainly almost no black and minority ethnic police officers there. It’s a really bad advert for British policing and it has to change and it’s not just me saying that. 'There has been this report, led by David Normington commissioned by the federation itself that listed all the ways in which the Federation was not fit for purpose and needed to change and pointed out that it does not enjoy the confidence of the overwhelming majority of its own members. 'I am very pleased that finally the Federation did, yesterday, vote for change. It was opposed by the Metropolitan Police Federation, which was a quarter of all policing. So I am afraid there are elements which don’t understand, that live in this Jurassic Park world of policing in a different age and I’m afraid it’s got to change.'","Former minister attacks police reaction to Home Secretary's speech .

"The two pieces of debris were found separately by members of the public and were flown to Australia for analysis.
Darren Chester said the finds were ""consistent with drift modelling"" of how debris from the missing plane may have been carried by ocean currents.
MH370 vanished in March 2014 with 239 people on board.
It was flying from the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and is widely believed to have gone down in the Indian Ocean after veering off course.
The fate of the plane, its passengers and crew remains one of aviation's biggest unsolved mysteries.
The only confirmed piece of debris found so far has been a section of wing called a flaperon, which was found on the Indian Ocean island of Reunion.
One of the parts retrieved in Mozambique was found on a sandbank by an amateur US investigator in late February and the other in December by a South African tourist.
Mr Chester said the investigation team had finished examining the debris and found both were ""consistent with panels from a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft"".
""The analysis has concluded the debris is almost certainly from MH370,"" he said in a statement.
He said it showed that the vast deep-sea search for the plane in the southern Indian Ocean, being led by Australia, was focusing on the right place.
The search, also involving experts from China and Malaysia, is scanning the sea floor, much of it previously unmapped, in the hope of locating the wreckage.
Mr Chester said it would continue for now, with 25,000 sq km (10,000 sq miles) of ocean still be to searched.
""We are focused on completing this task and remain hopeful the aircraft will be found.""
But the three countries have said that barring significant new evidence, they will end the operation once the area has been fully searched. The search is expected to be completed in the coming months.","Australia's transport minister says two plane parts found in Mozambique ""almost certainly"" came from missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370."
"By . Helen Pow . PUBLISHED: . 12:23 EST, 22 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:47 EST, 22 July 2013 . Children born in Atlanta, Detroit, Cleveland and Cincinnati are far less likely to pull themselves out of poverty than those whose parents earn the same amount of money in San Jose, San Francisco, Seattle and New York, a fascinating new study has shown. Top economists at Harvard and University of California, Berkeley analyzed millions of anonymous earnings records to compare income mobility across metropolitan areas - and the results are surprising. Living in an area with higher average incomes, larger tax credits for the poor or more local colleges does not necessarily improve the chances of someone rising beyond the station of their birth. But four broad factors did appear to have an affect, researchers pointed out, and they included the size and dispersion of the local middle class. The city where you live: The interesting study found the odds of rising to another income level are notably lower in certain cities, like Atlanta, and much higher in places like New York . If all else was equal, Americans living in cities with poor families more dispersed among mixed-income neighborhoods are more likely to climb the income ladder. Children growing up in areas with more two-parent households, better elementary schools and high schools, and more civic engagement, including membership in religious and community groups, were also more able to pull themselves out of poverty and up the income scale. 'Where you grow up matters,' Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist and one of the study’s authors, told The New York Times. 'There is tremendous variation across the U.S. in the extent to which kids can rise out of poverty.' Atlanta: Children born in Atlanta, pictured, are far less likely to pull themselves out of poverty than those whose parents earn the same amount of money in other cities . Where you lived matters less for well-off children than for middle-class and poor children, the researchers found. The chances that wealthy children grow up to be wealthy are broadly similar across all cities it appears. Metropolitan areas with larger black . populations had lower upward-mobility rates, but the researchers . believed this was not primarily because of their race. For example, both . white and black residents of Atlanta have low upward mobility, The . Times reported. Interestingly . Atlanta and Seatle have a similar average income, yet the difference . between upward mobility rates in the two cities are stark. On . average, fairly poor children in Seattle — those who grew up in the . 25th percentile of the national income distribution — do as well . financially when they grow up as middle-class children — those who grew . up at the 50th percentile — from Atlanta, according to The Times. Moving up the ladder: The study found children living in parts of California and the Northeast were far more likely to climb the income ladder than areas with the same average income in other parts of the country . Yet, children who moved from a city with poor rates of income mobility to a city with higher mobility rates at a young age were found to do almost as well at climbing the income ladder as kids who lived their whole lives in the latter region. If they moved as teenagers, however, they did less well, suggesting the characteristics of different regions rather than something inherent and unchangeable in the residents is responsible. The researchers pointed out that their data allowed them to identify only correlations not the causes for the intriguing patterns they discovered.","Harvard and University of California, Berkeley researchers analyzed millions of earnings records to compare income mobility across US cities .

Obama's biggest task tonight in the second presidential debate will be to woo back ‘waitress moms’ so crucial to his re-election, after a poll showed Mitt Romney has stole their votes in the first showdown and they are now neck and neck among women voters. According to a Gallup/USA Today poll of 12 swing states, Romney leads Obama by 12 points among men. But it is his surge among women voters to within one point of Obama that has given him a four-point overall lead that sets him on course to win the White House on November 6th. The poll, released on the eve of the second presidential debate in Hempstead, New York, marks an apparent end to months of double-digit Obama leads over Romney among women and has plunged Democrats into panic mode. Debate prep: President Obama spent the weekend in Williamsburg, Virginia preparing for the debate while Romney based his debate preparations at a Marriott in Boston, Massachusetts . New format: Unlike the first debate, the second meeting will be in a 'town hall' format in which undecided voters will pose questions to the candidates . Unlike the first debate, the second meeting will be in a ‘town hall’ format in which undecided ordinary voters – probably about a dozen – will pose questions. At least half of them are likely to be women. In addition, the debate will be moderated by a woman - CNN’s Candy Crowley. Democrats traditionally enjoy a marked advantage among women. Bill Clinton’s 1996 re-election was said to have been based on winning over middle class, aspirational so-called 'soccer moms'. But Obama’s popularity among females has plummeted after Romney’s commanding debate performance in Denver nearly two weeks ago. Vice-President Joe Biden's bullying display over Romney's running mate Paul Ryan also left many women voters feeling alienated. Tied: Mitt Romney is now neck and neck with President Obama among women voters, according to a new Gallup survey . Within an hour of the Gallup survey being released, the Obama campaign – which recently mocked Republicans for questioning poll methodology, went on the offensive against the 75-year-old polling firm. Reporters were sent a memo from Obama pollster Joel Benenson. In it, he said: ‘'The latest Gallup/USA Today Battleground survey showing President Obama and Governor Romney tied with women in battleground states (48-48) is an extreme outlier, defying the trends seen in every other battleground and national poll,' said Benenson. Overall, Romney has 50 per cent of support among likely voters in the 12 battleground states, while Obama is trailing with 46 per cent support, according to the survey. Without winning women, Obama's path to victory in November is complicated, if not impossible. The memo includes a chart of selected surveys from a handful of battleground states that give Obama a 10-point lead over Romney among women nationally.  'This implausible result among women appears to not even provide an accurate reflection on the electorate today, making its value questionable,' Benenson insisted. Women tend to start paying close attention to election campaigns later and are more open to persuasion than men. This makes female voters, particularly the blue-collar ‘waitress moms’ whose families have been hard-hit by the recession and unemployment, the most-prized group of swing voters in 2012. Fighting for women: Female voters, particularly the blue-collar . ‘waitress moms’ whose families have been hard-hit by the recession and . unemployment, are the most-prized group of swing voters in 2012 . Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic . pollster, told ‘USA Today’: ‘In every poll, we've seen a major surge . among women in favourability for Romney’ since the Denver debate. ‘Women . went into the debate actively disliking Romney, and they came out . thinking he might understand their lives and might be able to get . something done for them.’ Unlike the first presidential debate, tonight's debate will be in a 'town hall' format, meaning candidates will answer questions from members of an audience, rather than a moderator. There are 80 audience members total, which were selected by Gallup from a sample of undecided voters who live near the debate's location in Hempstead on Long Island. The participants had to submit their questions ahead of time. The debate moderator, CNN's Candy Crowley, will decide who to call on during the debate based on her reviews of their submitted questions. The candidates will have two minutes to respond to each question, after which the moderator can ask a follow-up question of her choosing. The candidates will have one minute to respond to the moderator's question. The 'town hall' format is designed to be more relaxed and conversational, with the candidates free to walk around the forum instead of remaining confined behind a podium or a desk. But the format also lends itself to more opportunities for unplanned or candid events, such as the 1992 debate where President Bush was caught on camera checking his watch. She . added that while Obama currently maintains an edge among women voters, . the changed views of Romney could be ‘a precursor to movement’ in . greater numbers towards the Republican nominee. ‘It opens them up to . take a second look, and that's the danger for Obama.' Democrats were scrambling Monday to maintain their historical edge among female voters. Party officials held a conference call in an effort to raise alarm over how a Republican administration would impact women's lives negatively and the . progressive group MoveOn.org released an ad starring three Hollywood . actresses who claimed Republicans would try to end abortion rights for . women. The . Romney campaign, on the other hand, touted the survey's findings as . proof that women are increasingly concerned about the economy instead of . issues like birth control. Republicans said the survey shows women feel . Romney is better equipped than Obama to spur economic growth. Romney's path to winning a greater share of the female voting bloc has been long and arduous. He . trailed the president by 18 percentage points among female voters in a . Gallup survey from April, around the time that Democrats were attacking . Republicans for 'waging a war on women' by supporting legislation that . would limit insurance coverage for contraceptives. That's when Romney's advisers decided to . step up the visibility of his wife, Ann, on the campaign trail to try . and make Romney more relatable as a husband and a father. Wooing women: First Lady Michelle Obama and Romney's wife, Ann, have been helping their husbands appeal to women on the campaign trail . The campaign also organized 'Women for . Romney' grassroots groups in battleground states across the country and . began cutting dozens of television ads that featured clips of Ann . talking about Mr Romney's 'softer' side. The strategy has helped Romney slowly . chip away at Obama's lead among female voters and after the president's . decidedly lackluster debate performance earlier this month, Romney . appears to be finally closing the gender gap. As Romney looks to maintain the progress . he's made among female voters, he's likely to tread lightly on topics . such as abortion and birth control during tonight's debate -- and to . pivot back to the economy whenever possible. Introducing Ann: Romney's advisers decided to step up the . visibility of his wife, Ann, on the campaign trail to try and make . Romney more relatable as a husband and a father . In the lead: Overall, Romney has 50 per cent of support among likely voters in 12 battleground states, while Obama is trailing with 46 per cent support, according to the Gallup survey . High stakes: President Obama's supporters are hoping for a stronger performance from their candidate in Tuesday's debate after his lackluster first performance . President Obama, on the other hand, will be looking for every opportunity to remind female voters of the measures he has enacted while in office that target women, such as the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. He will also be looking for every chance to remind women that that he was raised by a single mom and that he is the father of two daughters.","Mitt Romney is heading into the second presidential debate with a four-point lead over President Obama, according to the latest Gallup survey .

"(EW.com) -- This week's episode of ""How I Met Your Mother"" featured a pretty unforgettable smile-inducing kicker. After Ted found himself bemoaning his romantic setbacks and lack of personal progress, a look into the not-so-distant future revealed he had a daughter. Tear up? Join the club. But would you have guessed that the moment wasn't even part of the greater plan for the season? ""We had a week of treading water, to be honest,"" says co-creator/executive producer Carter Bays. ""We have the arc of the season going, but this was one week where there wasn't one, specific big event happening. We always get nervous about those kinds of episodes because you want to know that the story is moving forward."" So, he says, they took a ""step back,"" and decided to put a little perspective on the overall story of the series. ""We were really telling the story that a father probably should tell his kids because it was only 22 minutes as opposed to seven seasons,"" he jokes. Indeed the flashbacks and talk about the past was a nice reminder of where we've been with the gang. But as Bays sees it, it's also a great reminder of where we're going -- without giving everything away. Yes, he admits, they made sure Neil Patrick Harris hid his left hand so we wouldn't know whether or not Barney would be married three years from now. ""He's so good at making that look natural,"" he says, laughing. ""He's a magician; he's good with his hands. He knows what he's doing"" But does Barney? This episode saw the once notorious womanizer seemingly settling into life as a one-woman man. To be fair, Becki Newton previously warned EW that Barney and Quinn would be on the fast track. But after just a few episodes of courting, they're living together...and liking it! Is it all too fast? Bays doesn't think so. ""I think Barney is in love. At a certain age, you stop worrying about the pacing so much and you sort of realize you're only on this planet a short time so you might as well be with the person you care about the most,"" he says. ""And I think that's Quinn right now for Barney."" The best way to show that, he says, was to break barriers -- by breaking wind. ""We put off having a fart sound effect on our show for seven years, and we did pretty well without it. And it was one of those things as a showrunner that you know two things right away: You're going to be embarrassed that you're doing it at the table read, and you know that in the final cut, it's going to be the funniest moment and get a laugh,"" he says. ""And it's not 'Blazing Saddles' -- cowboys sitting around eating beans â€” it's actually a very real threshold to cross in a relationship. It's a big relationship moment."" So where do they go from here? For one, Quinn and Barney will continue moving pretty quickly, he says, and next week, we'll see more from Robin (Colbie Smulders) than we did in this episode. ""Robin, there is some excitement in her life coming up, especially next week's episode,"" he says. When we pick up, Robin and Ted still aren't talking and viewers are going to see how that affects their lives and friendship. ""We went for the reality of those situations,"" he says. ""I feel like on this show we've gone as far as we can go where it's just the gang hanging out at the bar week in and week out, with these big thing happen to them that don't really change things. Ted and Robin have now reached the point where it's not as simple as hanging out at the bar and forgetting the fact that Ted's in love with her, and she's not in love with him. It's complicated.""

"Otsuchi, Japan (CNN) -- Kyoko Ogawa wore the brave face the world associated with Japan's tsunami survivors. The March 11 catastrophe washed away all her earthly possessions. She watched as her hotel burned to the ground in a gas explosion triggered by the tsunami; a hotel that had been in her family for generations. She was determined not to let the disaster break her. But after the elation of finding her son alive, the reality of losing her livelihood started to erode the calm facade. She was in turmoil. She was afraid to talk to other people about it because she knew everyone was suffering as much as her, if not more. They were ""ganbaru,"" she recalls -- enduring, holding on, withstanding, and living with the pain. She couldn't be the only one to lose control. ""I was in shock because I realized that all that was precious to me was gone,"" she says, six months on from that terrible day. ""I didn't know what to do from then on. I became tormented."" That was the start of a slippery slope down a dark trail of despair. It's a familiar story in Otsuchi, northeastern Japan, where the devastating earthquake and tsunami turned much of the town in Iwate Prefecture into rubble. Today, much of that physical debris has been cleared away. But the emotional wreckage of the survivors is proving much more difficult to remove, as the mental scars from that day linger months later. In Ogawa's case, depression could have had tragic consequences for her had she not met Suimei Morikawa, a volunteer psychiatrist who listened patiently to her troubles one day at an evacuation center. Morikawa became the difference between life and death. She says she probably would have ended her life if the doctor hadn't been there for her. ""I was so moved by her approach to life,"" recalls Morikawa. ""She may have been suffering and wanting to end her life because she had lost so much, but she also desperately wanted to get over that. I was moved by her willingness to get out of her own situation. I just helped her a little."" Concerns about suicide and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are growing among mental health specialists working in the region. PTSD in particular, a condition which can push people over the edge if not addressed, can show up months after the initial shock. Suicide is also a major concern in Japan. According to the World Health Organization, Japan has the fifth highest suicide rate in the world. More than 30,000 suicides are reported each year, according to the country's national police agency, with Iwate Prefecture -- one of the regions hit hardest by the tsunami -- having one of the biggest problems. Mariko Ukiyo, a psychologist and volunteer counselor, is part of a therapy group called ""Team Japan 300."" She and a number of other team members visit temporary villages in the devastated region hoping to treat symptoms of PTSD and ultimately prevent suicides. According to Ukiyo, loneliness and despair take hold when the survivors move from their evacuation center to temporary housing. ""It is only then that people see how their life has changed from their pre-disaster life,"" she says. ""The sense of loss and deep grief can overcome you quickly and if you are alone when that happens, you lose all hope for the future. I think this period is when they need help the most."" But getting help to the victims is proving to be a challenge in Japan, a country with limited experience in mental health care historically. Ukiyo says the amount of psychological support received by tsunami victims now is a tenth of what the victims of 9/11 in the United States experienced. According to Ukiyo, the devastating 1995 earthquake in the city of Kobe started to raise awareness about the effects of post-traumatic stress -- particularly among the younger generation -- but many Japanese continue to find it difficult to talk about sorrow and loss because of the shame of appearing weak. Ukiyo's strategy is to gather the residents in temporary housing for a regular get-together in a relaxed atmosphere. This gives her the opportunity to keep an eye on each of the participants, observing anyone that shows signs of severe distress. The hope is that what starts out as small talk will gradually evolve into people talking about themselves and their problems. But despite her efforts Ukiyo is not optimistic about the region's future with trauma. ""We are only now starting to hear about sick or depressed people six months after the tsunami,"" she says. She believes suicide rates will only increase. Meanwhile, Kyoko Ogawa vows not to be another victim. She says Dr. Morikawa pulled her back from the brink and she is now making plans for the future. She wants to rebuild her hotel and give back to those who helped her. While Ogawa is a success story for Morikawa, he worries about those he will never reach in this devastated region. ""Now that I have met these people, I have grown attached to them,"" he says. ""It saddens me that there are still so many people suffering here. I can't stand the thought that there may be people who died because they had no-one to talk to.""","Kyoko Ogawa became depressed after losing her hotel in March tsunami .

Its mission isn't only to stop people from being smuggled onto the continent's southern shores -- it's to save lives. The plane patrols the Mediterranean Sea south of Sicily, including the area around Lampedusa, an Italian island near the African coast that migrants have been trying to reach in often unseaworthy boats. In October more than 300 migrants died when their boat capsized near these shores, and Frontex is hoping to prevent that from happening again. INFOGRAPHIC: How illegal immigrants enter the EU . The Frontex crew took CNN along on a surveillance flight. Human trafficking in the region is big business, and we were not allowed to identify any of the mission's crew member for fear they could be targeted by gangs of smugglers. ""On the missions, every week we find three or four targets of interest,"" the aircraft's captain told CNN. ""The main goal is to detect targets of interest that Frontex [give us the coordinates for] ... we go there and we check it out and then we transmit everything to Frontex."" Fishing boats are often targets of interest because they are sometimes used to smuggle people from Africa to Europe. Often those vessels will be old, rusty and overloaded with migrants as the traffickers try to maximize their profit per journey. In some cases, sailing ships have been used for people smuggling as well. On our flight the crew also spotted an abandoned rubber boat, which might have been left there by people who made it to shore in Europe. OPINION: Europe's immigration nightmare just beginning . The plane is outfitted with infrared sensors and a belly camera that can identify and track targets at great distances. The crew will look for vessels that have an unusually high number of people on board, but they're also checking to see whether a ship move strangely in the water -- a possible sign that it is overloaded with migrants under deck. Several high profile incidents involving migrant boats from northern Africa have thrust the issue of illegal immigration to the forefront of European politics -- and now the EU is looking for ways to better regulate immigration while protecting the lives of those who try to make it to the continent. An increasing number of ill-equipped migrant ships are getting into trouble during their voyages towards Europe, and the Italian Navy and Coast Guard often need to speed to the rescue to save those on board. Most of them end up in migrant camps in Italy, Greece or Malta. The Pozallo camp in southern Sicily is one of the bigger ones, with over 400 people living on site. OPINION: EU must solve crisis to deserve Nobel Prize . One of those recently saved from the seas is Henry Linus from Nigeria. He says the ship he was on got into a storm and was adrift at sea before they were rescued. ""There was no food, [there was] excrement inside the boat. People were vomiting inside the boat, we were vomiting everywhere. It was horrible,"" he told CNN. Linus added that if given the chance to do it all over again, he would not try to make the treacherous journey to Europe. Andrea Tassara is the Commander of the Italian Coast guard in Pozallo, one of the busiest Coast Guards in Europe. He always has two high-speed boats on standby that can go about 30 knots and take on as many as 130 people from other boats or from the sea. Tassara says he and his men are appalled at some of the boats they come upon while patrolling the Mediterranean. ""The most dangerous thing is when you see a boat that is made of really old wood. God knows how it is held together and it can fall apart just by our ships coming close,"" he said. But many people are so desperate that they are willing to take their chances. That cost more than 300 people their lives on October 3rd, when a boat originating from Libya was so overloaded and unstable that it capsized when a fire on board the vessel caused its passengers to panic. OPINION: What's the place of outsiders in Europe? Most of those who drowned were Eritreans. At the Pozallo camp we met an Eritrean man who said that he was supposed to be on the boat that sank, but that it was so full he was rejected and had to wait for a later ship. He says many people who had spent the last couple of years fighting their way through African deserts to the coast had died in the shipwreck. ""Some of us had parents or wives or children on there, we were part of that group. But fortunately the boat was full and we were obliged to stay,"" he told CNN. Italian Coast Guard Commander Tassara says the increase in migrant boats trying to get to Europe is huge, even though he cannot put numbers on it. He says the waves of ships usually stop in the fall and winter months, but this year there has been no let-up. He attributes that in part to good weather conditions on the sea, but also to the growing despair in places like Syria, Eritrea, and Nigeria, where many are now trying to flee the violent extremist group Boko Haram. It does not look like those waves will stop. Even if Europe further beefs up its patrols on its borders, they might be able to contain migration for a while, but they will never be able to stop it.","CNN goes on patrol with EU border agency searching Mediterranean for migrant boats .

"Poppi Worthington was found with serious injuries at her home in Barrow, Cumbria, in December 2012.
In January, a judge ruled she had been sexually assaulted by her father, Paul Worthington, who denies any wrongdoing.
He was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault in August 2013.
Reaction to the CPS announcement
Key dates in Poppi Worthington case
A CPS spokesman said: ""The CPS has looked at the original decision in this case that there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction - as we often do in other cases.
""We have reached the same conclusion.""
In a statement released following the announcement, Poppi's mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she was ""desperate"" to understand more about the police investigation and the events leading up to her daughter's death.
Speaking on her behalf, solicitor Fiona McGhie, said: ""She is angry and disappointed with the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service and wishes to be given time and space at this difficult time as we approach the inquest.""
Cumbria Police, which is being investigated by the police watchdog, has been criticised over its investigation into the death, after it emerged officers failed to preserve vital items for forensic analysis.
Chief Constable Jerry Graham said the force ""deeply regrets"" the way the case was handled.
In January, Mr Justice Peter Jackson's ruling was made as part of care proceedings in the family court involving Poppi's siblings.
He concluded the force carried out no ""real"" investigation into the death of the toddler for nine months, and highlighted a list of basic errors in evidence-gathering.
Speaking after the CPS announced its decision, Mr Graham said the investigation had fallen ""below standard"".
He said: ""I would like to make a full and heartfelt apology to Poppi's family and all those who loved her.""
He said the main failings were not preserving potentially relevant evidence from Poppi's home and the length of time it took to interview family and key witnesses.
He also said forensic analysis was not carried out quickly enough and accurate records were not kept.
Prosecutors originally decided there was insufficient evidence ""to provide a realistic prospect of conviction"", but in January the CPS said it was reviewing the case.
Cumbria police and crime commissioner Peter McCall said: ""I am disappointed that despite a re-investigation no criminal charges will be brought.
""The constabulary has let Poppi down as no-one has been brought to justice for her tragic death.""
Barrow Labour MP John Woodcock said he was ""bitterly disappointed"" at the CPS decision and that Cumbria Police's mistakes had ""thwarted the chance of ever getting justice for Poppi's death"".
A second inquest into the toddler's death is due to take place in the autumn.","There is insufficient evidence to charge a man over the death of his 13-month-old daughter, the CPS has said, months after a judge ruled he had sexually assaulted her."
"The RMT union is planning two further days of strike action in an ongoing dispute with ScotRail over driver-only trains.
Labour urged Humza Yousaf to meet the parties in a bid to end the stalemate.
Transport Scotland said the minister had already engaged with both sides to find a solution.
The RMT plans to hold two further 24-hour strikes, on Sunday 24 and 31 July, after the failure of talks through the conciliation service Acas.
Labour's transport spokesman Neil Bibby said: ""Rail passengers have already faced significant disruption this summer due to infrastructure work on the Queen Street tunnel and Glasgow Subway causing delays and cancellations.
""The new UK transport secretary said resolving the dispute on Southern Railways was his 'top priority'. The SNP government should start to take seriously the real concerns of ScotRail staff and get a grip of this situation.""
The RMT opposes any extension of driver-only trains and wants guards to be in control of operating doors, which it claims is a safer system.
But ScotRail has said 59% of customers already travel on a train where the doors are safely opened and closed by the driver, and that a second person would always be scheduled to be on board trains to help customers.
A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: ""Everyone wants to see an end to these strikes, Scotland's rail passengers most of all.
""The minister for transport and Transport Scotland officials have engaged with both sides throughout to find a solution, which we still believe lies in meaningful discussion.
""To this end we would call on both parties to get around the table and find a way to end these strikes once and for all.
""The Scottish government's resilience committee has met regularly since this period of disruption began to ensure that proper planning and contingency measures have been in effect to minimise disruption for passengers.""
Transport Scotland said it had been assured by ScotRail that over 80% of services would run as normal this weekend.
Passengers are advised to check the ScotRail strike information web page before they travel.",Scottish Labour has urged the transport minister to broker a deal between unions and ScotRail to head off planned industrial action.
"Bernard Gavrin, from Brooklyn, New York, who will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia this month, 70 years after he went missing during the Second World War . An American soldier will finally be buried with full military honours, 70 years after he went missing in action during the Second World War. The Department of Defense has confirmed that Army Private Bernard Gavrin from Brooklyn, New York, will be buried in Arlington National Cemetery after his remains were discovered only last year. According to the Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office, Private Gavrin was just 29 when he was reported missing on July 7, 1944. His regiment has been in Saipan, Japan, in the Northern Mariana Islands of the western Pacific Ocean and came under heavy attack, suffering many casualties. Mr Gavrin was declared dead in July 1945 and by 1948, his remains were deemed non-recoverable. However, in recent years, excavations in Saipan by a Japanese non-profit group have turned up the remains of several American and Japanese soldiers from the Second World War. Last year the remains and personal items from American soldiers were uncovered and were handed over to the American government for testing. It then emerged that the remains of Mr Gavrin were among them after they were tested using a family member's DNA. Mr Gavrin's 82-year-old nephew David Rogers, of Delray Beach, Florida, said he was planning to be at the burial in the cemetery on September 12. He said it was 'absolutely incredible and unbelievable to all of us' that Gavrin would be laid to rest in 'the most honorable place you could be buried in this country.' Mr Rogers, whose mother was Gavrin's sister, said the private was the youngest of three children and had enlisted in 1940. He said the last time he saw his uncle was when he was eight-years-old and his uncle came to visit. Mr Rogers had injured himself, requiring stitches, and Mr Gavrin went to his bedroom. Mr Gavrin will be buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia on September 12 . 'He awakened me and kissed me on the forehead,' Rogers said. He also recalled how the loss of his uncle was shattering and said that when the telegram came to inform the family he was missing, that his grandmother, Mr Gavrin's mother, opened it. He added: 'She let out a scream that lives with me to this day.'","Private Bernard Gavrin went missing in action in Saipan during WWII .

"Their faces are etched with deep lines that reveal lives lived in hardship. Their expressions captured by UK-based artist and photographer Lee Jeffries, who strives to reveal the human face of addiction, the reality of homelessness and the real face of poverty through his work. Travelling the globe Mr Jeffries, who is a full-time accountant, has sought to capture the faces of those people shunned by society. His latest project took him to Miami in Florida. There he met Margo Stevens, a former porn star resigned to living on the streets of the Overtown district. Photographer Lee Jeffries has made it his mission in life to give a human face to poverty, addiction and homelessness. For his latest project he spent two weeks in Miami, where he met former porn star Margo Stevens (pictured) Ms Stevens (right) was a successful adult film star in the 1990s, living a comfortable life from the money she made, supplement by working as an escort. Today she lives on the streets of the Overtown district of Miami, in an abandoned garage with five other girls, who sell their bodies for sex to feed their drug addictions . In two weeks, Jeffries delved beyond the labels that are so readily used to define Ms Stevens and others. He looked past the 'prostitute', the 'homeless down and out' and instead reveals Ms Stevens to be a mother-figure who reaches out to the younger women around her, offering advice, shelter and a friend to turn to. Pictured is a woman called Trish, who works on the streets using the name 'Snow' 'Her story is stark,' Jeffries told MailOnline. 'She is a beautiful person, whose story is both fascinating and tragic. 'She's been exploited her whole life, but still she remains incredibly human. 'Margo was a well-known porn star in the 1990s, she lived the life back then. But her fall to life now hit me hard.' Jeffries said he found Ms Stevens sleeping in an abandoned garage, meausring 12ft by 6ft, with five other girls. Most are addicted to heroin, and all live off the money they make as sex workers. He spent two weeks with Ms Stevens learning about the fate which befell her. After stripping in clubs in Cleveland for a living as a young woman, she fell into working in the adult film industry becoming an escort. For years she lived comfortably from the earnings she made. But eventually life dealt her a cruel hand. Far from being able to distance himself from his art, Jeffries is immersed in it. He admits, the project touched him, leaving him angry at the way the adult film industry exploits women like Ms Stevens. Sex worker Trish is pictured without the wig she wears, when she assumes her alter ego Snow (picture above) Through his pictures, Jeffries uncovers stories of survival, women driven to selling their bodies as a means of feeding their addiction struggling through life with nowhere else to turn. Pictured is Brittany . The girls in Overtown survive. Labelled ""crack whores"" some will use their bodies to get the next $10 fix and are often treated worse than stray dogs by the men there. Jeffries said: 'I don't judge Margo,' he said. 'She is in a spiral for whatever reason, it is not important. She chooses not to help herself and maybe the grip of her addiction is such that she can't. She understands what she is doing, the life she is living. She understands the choices she makes, she just cannot see a way out.' A devastating spiral of homelessness, drug addiction and prostitution ensued.

She is so much more than the drugs and the prostitution, the labels. She cares for the younger girls she stays with, often to the detriment of herself.'

Pictured is Latoria . Ms Stevens is not alone in her hardship. Though each has a distinct and unique voice, there are millions of people across the world like Ms Stevens, real people with nowhere to call home. Pictured is Latoria . Of his work, Jeffries said: 'This is a small ripple but it is significant in terms of what one person can do' Far from being able to distance himself from his art, Jeffries is immersed in it. He admits, the project touched him, leaving him angry at the way the adult film industry exploits women like Ms Stevens. In an interview filmed by Jeffries, Ms Stevens reveals her starting rate in the industry was $500 and the contracts she signed were such that she made no money off the continued reproduction of her performances. 'A lot of people in the industry are quite slimy,' she said. 'They do a lot of exploiting. There are a lot of things about the adult industry that need to change.' Addressing the financial exploitation, she adds: 'It makes me feel a fool. I'm responsible for that. I let that happen.' But when asked by Jeffries if she regrets her path in life, Ms Stevens tells the camera, 'no'. 'Not at all,' she said. It is a brave and honest answer, one which garners Jeffries' respect and admiration.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When it comes to Sharia-compliant banking, few Western countries can compete with Britain. One of the world's prime financial centers, the City of London is also the key Western hub for Islamic banking. The IBB opened its doors in 2004 and became the UK's first and only standalone Islamic high street bank. With 23 banks, nine fund managers and a number of international law firms offering Islamic finance in the City, by 2006 British Sharia-compliant assets were thought to be in the region of $22 billion. The global industry has trebled in the past decade and is now worth around $531 billion. Britain is also in the vanguard when it comes to Sharia-compliant retail banking, catering for its population of approximately three million Muslims. In 2004, the Islamic Bank of Britain (IBB) opened its doors for the first time, becoming the UK's first and only standalone Islamic high street bank. A number of Britain's ""big five"" high street banks are getting in on the act. Lloyds TSB and HSBC offer Islamic banking, including mortgages, current accounts and trust funds for children. In the retail market, Britain is the only European country that offers government-authorized Islamic banking products. In the United States, only regional banks like University Bank, Michigan offer Sharia-compliant products. Authorities and regulators in France -- despite having a Muslim population twice the size of Britain's at six million -- have been slow to realize the potential of this sector. ""In France, Islamic finance is at an embryonic stage. They are where we were three or four years ago,"" Sultan Choudhury, the IBB's director of sales told the Financial Times. British mosques dating back 150 years attest to the long connection between the United Kingdom and Muslims, but it is the British government's staunch support of the sector -- backing words with legislative changes -- that has responded to the needs of Muslims in the financial world. Junaid Bhatti, who was involved with the setup of the IBB, told CNN: ""Government is a firm supporter of the industry down to amending legislation to create a level playing field for Islamic banking."" The British sector is currently experiencing phenomenal growth of around 20 percent per year compared with global growth of around 15 percent. Industry insiders feel there is still scope for continued growth. Aktar Ahmed of Lloyds TSB Islamic finance told CNN: ""Islamic finance is still in its infancy at the moment. We're seeing a fantastic rate of growth both globally and here in the UK."" Lloyds TSB now offers Sharia-compliant banking at all of its 2,000 UK branches. Services include an Islamic current account, mortgage and child trust fund. Islamic mortgages have proved particularly successful in Britain, with the market growing from barely a trickle in 2003 to a value of $1.7 billion in 2007. But Islamic banking in the United States is suffering from an image problem. Many Americans are felt to be hostile to the concept after the 9/11 attacks, equating it with ""terrorist finance."" ""There seems to be this misperception out there that the U.S. is perhaps Islamophobic,"" said Abdi Shayesteh, an attorney at law firm King and Spalding, which has had a practice dedicated to Islamic banking and finance since the 1980s. ""The U.S. regulators have been supportive and they've accommodated Islamic banking and finance since the mid 80s,"" Shayesteh told CNN. With a best-guess figure of six million Muslims in the United States of whom around 60 percent are devout (and therefore likely to use Islamic banking services), Shayesteh considers domestic Sharia-compliant banking an untapped market. ""We have at least 3.6 million [potential customers] at the very base level market opportunity for banks from abroad and here to tap into,"" he explained. Even so, with constitutional limits on promoting any one religion over another, which keeps legislators quiet about the opportunities, and no sign that any major American banks will be rolling out Islamic products, the market remains unexploited for now.

This sort of in-depth profiling raises alarm bells with privacy activists. 'Consumers have increasingly digital lives and they are developing an unfathomably large data trail every day,' says Rainey Reitman, activism director for privacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation. 'There has never been another time in history where privacy was under the kind of assault it is today.' You can opt out of the tracking, or manually edit your details.

"In 2004, Sen. John Kerry entered the campaign against incumbent President George W. Bush with a seemingly unassailable advantage on a sensitive issue -- the liberal Kerry served in the Vietnam War, and the conservative Bush didn't. Rather than avoid the topic, Bush supporters came up with the notorious ""Swift Boat"" campaign that raised enough questions about Kerry's war record to negate a major strength. Such ""attack the strength"" tactics have been a staple of this year's presidential race, with both sides trying to undermine perceived advantages of the other. The latest example is a new Web video that accuses President Barack Obama of engineering classified leaks and claiming undue credit on his signature foreign policy achievement: the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The premise is simple: In a political environment where perception often trumps policy, mount early challenges to your opponent's strongest attributes to raise questions and create an alternative image in the minds of voters. For example, the Obama campaign has attacked certain Republican nominee Mitt Romney's successful business career, portraying the venture capitalist company he founded as a pioneer in outsourcing American jobs. The purpose was to blunt Romney's persistent claim that his business background made him better qualified than Obama to manage the slow-recovering economy, the most important issue to voters. Meanwhile, Romney's team is challenging Obama on the volatile issue of reforming Medicare, the popular health care program for senior citizens. By naming House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan as his running mate last week, Romney and his team knew the Obama campaign would attack Ryan's proposal to partially privatize Medicare, so they have tried to turn the tables by accusing the president this week of cutting more than $700 billion out of the government-run system. Both of the attacks are misleading or untrue, according to independent assessments. Websites such as PolitiFact.com and Fact.Check.org ruled that outsourcing by Romney's company, Bain Capital, occurred after he gave up daily management responsibilities in 1999. On Medicare, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that reforms to the program under Obama's 2010 health care law resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in savings, rather than spending cuts that reduced benefits, as alleged by the Romney campaign. PolitiFact rated the Romney campaign's claim as ""mostly false."" To Republican strategist Ron Bonjean , the Romney camp's maneuver on Medicare was ""a brilliant move."" ""They are going to be attacked on it anyway. They have 'jujitsued' this,"" Bonjean told CNN on Friday, adding: ""It's a good idea to try to neutralize this issue right now, which I think they are being very effective at."" Outside groups supporting the candidates also are taking part. A video spot by Priorities USA Action, a super-PAC backing Obama, sought to link Romney to the death of the wife of a steel worker who lost his job at a plant closed down by Bain Capital. The ad, which has yet to be scheduled for broadcast, was rated ""false"" by PolitiFact. Now, a little-known group of former special forces members called the Special Operations OPSEC Education Fund has released the 22-minute Web video that criticizes Obama on the bin Laden takedown. A spokeswoman says the group has raised about $1 million toward an advertising campaign in some key swing states, but refused to discuss donors. Over a picture of Obama, the video's narrator says that the group's mission is to stop politicians from using sensitive intelligence about the bin Laden raid and other clandestine programs for political benefit. The organization, which describes itself as nonpartisan, shares an office with two Republican political consulting firms in Alexandria, Virginia. Its spokesman, Chad Kolton, worked for the Bush administration as a spokesman for the Director of National Intelligence, and its president ran for Congress as a Republican. To Darrell West of the Brookings Institution, the video evokes memories of the Swift Boat campaign that mounted a barrage of negative attacks against Kerry's war record. ""Obama's strong suit actually is on national security,"" said West, the vice president and director of governance studies at Brookings. ""He's the guy who got bin Laden, and that's been a central claim of his campaign. So there's always a risk of the opposition coming in with this type of ad to try to undermine the president's credibility and take away what is really his strong suit."" The president has regularly cited the killing of bin Laden as a campaign promise he fulfilled, and the head of special operations, Adm. William  McRaven, recently told CNN that Obama deserved credit. ""Make no mistake about it: It was the president of the United States that shouldered the burden for this operation, that made the hard decisions,"" McRaven said. Like other top officials, including Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, McRaven also has been highly critical of recent leaks about clandestine operations. The White House has denied leaking classified information, and two federal prosecutors have been assigned to investigate recent leaks about the Stuxnet virus and drone strike operations. Republicans blame Obama for the leaks that occurred on his watch, and they call for an independent investigation. The ""attack the strength"" tactic is nothing new, but gained prominence last decade when utilized by Republican strategist Karl Rove, who guided Bush's two presidential campaigns . ""Karl Rove did something that many other political operatives don't do, and it's really an element of why he's a unique figure in American political life,"" journalist Wayne Slater said in a PBS Frontline documentary titled ""Karl Rove: The Architect."" ""He understands that while other people look for the weakness in an opponent and exploit that, Rove has long looked at the strength of an opponent."" That was particularly true of the Swift Boat attacks on Kerry, said Slater, co-author of the book ""Bush's Brain: How Karl Rove Made George W. Bush Presidential."" ""The No. 1 thing that John Kerry offered was his heroic service in Vietnam,"" Slater said in the PBS documentary, ""and so what Rove did was attack the strength of Kerry, not his weakness."" Others clearly  took notice. In attacking Romney's background at Bain Capital, the Obama campaign is following the example of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich from the Republican primary campaign. Gingrich's criticism that Romney's business record included shutting down companies and outsourcing jobs got panned by many fellow Republicans. In response, Gingrich said his attacks were only the initial salvos of an all-out assault on the issue that Romney would face from the Obama campaign if he became the nominee.","A GOP strategist says the Romney campaign ""jujitsued"" Obama on Medicare .

"They say it is a result of significant increase in loss of human lives from attacks by wild animals.
The problem is especially acute in buffer zones between human settlements and national parks.
In recent years, Nepal has developed a successful protection programme for many endangered species.
The Chitwan National Park in southern Nepal has more than 500 rhinos, up from half that figure few years ago, and more than 125 tigers.
The Bardiya National Park in the west now has more than 80 elephants, almost 10 times as many as there were in the 1990s.
In the Himalayas, the numbers of endangered species like snow leopards and red pandas have been growing as well.
And the country has nearly 24% of its land area as protected areas, including national parks, conservation areas and wildlife reserves.
With all these achievements in nature conservation, however, Nepal has also witnessed a rising number of human deaths and property losses because of wildlife.
In the last five years, more than 80 people have been killed by wild elephants while 17 of the animals died in retaliatory killings, according to forest ministry officials.
Last month, local people in Chitwan, southern Nepal, staged a strike and demanded that a rogue elephant be killed after it had taken the lives of three people.
A few months ago, a leopard in western Nepal caused terror as it killed more than a dozen people within a matter of weeks.
In eastern Nepal, herds of wild elephants continue to rampage, demolishing human settlements and raiding crops.
Meanwhile, common leopards are increasingly attacking children and livestock in the hilly region.
Further north, in the trans-Himalayan region, locals continue to complain about snow leopards preying on their livestock.
Although forest ministry officials are yet to compile the latest data on these losses, they do admit that such incidents have gone up remarkably.
""Before, we used to record about 30 human deaths because of wildlife attacks annually but in the past few years the figure appears to have risen significantly,"" said Forest Ministry spokesman Krishna Acharya who, until recently, headed Nepal's Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation.
He added: ""The time has now come for us to determine how many such wildlife species we can have in our protected areas.""
WWF's Nepal country director, Anil Manandhar, said the problem had become quite serious.
""This is now something that could become the biggest threat and setback for Nepal's success in wildlife conservation,"" he explained.
Wildlife experts say human settlements known as buffer zones around national parks have become flashpoints for human-wildlife encounters.
""The numbers of rhinos and tigers are increasing in the national park and they are moving out in search of food and space. Meanwhile, the increasing human population needs more of the natural resources available, and that competition creates conflict,"" said Mr Acharya.
Most of Nepal's national parks and protected areas are either in the Himalayan region or in the Tarai area, the southern plain land that border India.
Yet, wildlife-related loss of lives and properties are also increasingly being seen in the mid-hill region, geographically located between the Himalayas and Tarai plain land.
Conservationists point at the growing number of attacks on children and livestock by common leopards because this region has seen huge success in community forestry.
""We have been hearing complaints from farmers that community forests have more wildlife than in some national parks and therefore they are suffering losses of lives and properties,"" said Yam Bahadur Malla, country director for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in Nepal.
He also suggested it was necessary to scientifically demarcate the boundaries of national parks, as some species involved in the attacks were sometimes found outside the existing boundaries.
Forest ministry officials, however, said the chances of expanding existing protected areas were very slim because Nepal had already made huge swathes of land available for nature conservation.
Mr Acharya said the details of plans to limit wildlife growth were yet to be worked out but he added that one of the ideas would be to relocate some of the wildlife species.
""We have listed nine such species that can be trans-located from where there are quite many of them to where there are very few and such species include animals involved in conflicts with humans,"" he said.
Mr Acharya also hinted that Nepal will now not commit to protect more wildlife than the amount its protected areas could sustain.
""For instance, we have said we will double the number of tigers to 250. But as we cannot expand our protected areas, we will not be able to commit more than that,"" he said.
""Nor can we add new conservation areas.""",Officials in Nepal have said they will now have to put a cap on the growth of wildlife including endangered species like tigers and rhinos.
"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Doctors using Skype to check on a patient at home helped save her husband’s life when he collapsed in front of them. Medics were monitoring kidney patient Brenda Griffin via the internet when they saw her husband, Peter, who was sitting next to her, keel over. The hospital staff immediately dialled 999 and told Mrs Griffin how she could unlink herself from her kidney dialysis machine so she could help her 70-year-old husband. Medics who were monitoring Brenda Griffin while she underwent dialysis via the internet saw her husband Peter collapse on camera and were able to guide Mrs Griffin on how to unlink herself and help her husband . Paramedics were alerted and he was was rushed to hospital where it was discovered he had bowel cancer. Mrs Griffin, 65, from Draycott, near Derby, said: 'I don’t know what would have happened if we hadn’t been using Skype that day. 'Skype had already given me my life back because it meant I could have my treatment at home. Now it’s saved my husband as well.' Royal Derby Hospital is one of the first in England to use Skype internet video technology to speak to patients at home.

Royal Derby Hospital is one of the first in England to use Skype internet video technology so that patients do not have to spend so much time in hospital . Mrs Griffin had been attending three days a week to be hooked up to a dialysis machine for four hours at a time. But the treatment was gruelling and left her exhausted, so doctors came up with an alternative solution. Instead of traipsing into hospital, she would be able to stay at home to have her dialysis treatment, speaking face to face with staff at the hospital’s renal unit via Skype on her Kindle tablet. Mrs Griffin, a retired receptionist, said: 'My husband had set up the machine for me but it was one of those days where we were having problems with it, so I decided to Skype the unit. 'While I was talking, Peter suddenly said he didn’t feel well. He sat down and then, all of a sudden, he passed out. 'The hospital was asking what was going on as Peter came around. He went to go and mop his brow but then he passed out again. Mrs Griffin had been attending three days a week to be hooked up to a dialysis machine for four hours at a time . 'At this point, I was tied up to my machine so I couldn’t do anything. Peter normally helps me out with it.

'If it hadn’t been for Skype, I don’t know what would have happened. It’s a wonderful thing.' Mr Griffin, a retired British Rail supervisor, was taken to hospital after his collapse last November. Tests revealed he had collapsed and felt unwell because he was suffering from bowel cancer.

"(CNN) -- When looking at the world's lowest unemployment rates, one of the first things you might notice is that many of the countries are in Southeast Asia. Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam all have unemployment rates at or below 3%, ranking them in the top six overall, according to tradingeconomics.com. ""One reason why the unemployment rates in those countries are low is because they're starting to get a lot of investment that used to go to China and would have gone to China,"" said George T. Haley, a professor of marketing and international business at the University of New Haven and co-author of ""New Asian Emperors: The Business Strategies of the Overseas Chinese."" Haley said high wage inflation in China has prompted companies to start outsourcing to other countries instead. But investing in Southeast Asia is far from a new thing in the corporate world. ""The U.S., in its policies back during the Vietnam War, encouraged and gave actual subsidies to companies that would source from Southeast Asia because they wanted to use the investment to combat the spread of communism,"" Haley said. ""And over time, it just became a good place to invest. You had relatively low cost of labor ... you had investment support from the U.S. government, and you had the growing economy, which just fed on itself."" Speaking of the U.S., its unemployment rate is 9.2%, which ranks it close to the bottom among the countries on our table of 67 countries. While business is definitely booming in Southeast Asia, take its unemployment numbers with a grain of salt. Many countries define unemployment differently, so it's sometimes difficult to accurately compare rates from different regions. It's also important to note that the table above shows only unemployment rates that have been released since December 2010. Many countries are not on this list because they haven't released their rates in years, if at all. So while the table shows that Angola and South Africa are last on the list at 25%, they are likely far from the world's worst. The latest CIA World Factbook has estimated unemployment rates for most of these missing countries, and eight of them are above 50%. Zimbabwe might have a jobless rate as high as 95%. Other notable countries on the table: . *** America's unemployment rate is well behind its nearest neighbors, Mexico (5.2%) and Canada (7.4%). *** One of the roots of the so-called Arab Spring has been the lack of jobs, especially for young people in the Mideast and North Africa. Tunisia, the first government to fall, had an unemployment rate of 13% one month before its revolution. Egypt's rate was just under 12% in March. Morocco, another country in North Africa experiencing unrest, reported a rate of 9.1%.  *** Some of the highest rates on the list come from three countries that have recently received bailouts from the European Union. Ireland and Greece are both above 14%, while Portugal is just a few points behind at 12.4%. But it's Spain, at 21.3%, that has the highest unemployment rate in the EU.","Jobs appear to be plentiful in many Southeast Asian countries .
One of the reasons, an expert says, is that China -- not just the West -- is outsourcing there .
The United States' jobless rate is higher than the rates in Canada and Mexico ."
"Tony Adams wants the current Arsenal squad to stop calling him ‘Mr Adams’. He wants to stop having to tell them how it feels to be a winner because none of them know. He wants them to start writing their own history, starting with lifting the FA Cup at Wembley. It feels fitting that Adams is speaking at Repton Boxing Club in east London, in front of a black and white poster screaming ‘No Guts No Glory’. He is incredulous that Arsenal could be stifled by the tag of favourites and seems equally unimpressed as he explains Arsene Wenger believes he has a squad capable of winning the Champions League. Mr Arsenal: Tony Adams (left) won plenty of trophies as Arsenal skipper including the 1989 league title . Tear it down: Adams has been honoured with a statue, but wants this generation to write a new history . But then Adams, as he puts it, ‘likes winning things’. The former Arsenal captain can look back on four League titles, three FA Cups and two League Cups between 1987 and 2002. If his old club secure fourth place in the Barclays Premier League and the FA Cup this season it would only mean the campaign has ‘not been a failure; not like having to play in the Europa League like Tottenham’. He adds: ‘None of this Arsenal team knows what it’s like to win a trophy for the club. Arsene remembers, but not these players. ‘I did a Q&A with some of the players the other week, and all the questions about winning were coming to me because they didn’t have the answers. ‘I was talking to Carl Jenkinson and Kieran Gibbs and I was telling them: “You need to know how it feels just to get over the line” because it’s a weird feeling. ‘It was normal for us to win games. I’m not so sure this group of players has that. ‘They call me Mr Adams and stuff! I’m not sure I ever called older players “Mister”. Ambition: Wenger badly wants to win the Champions League after coming so close in 2006, says Adams . Learning to win: Adams has had to answer questions about success to both GIbbs (left) and Jenkinson (right) ‘I want them to be pushing me to the side and ripping my statue down and make their own history. ‘They’re lovely guys, but they need leadership. Mikel Arteta’s a good pro without being, for me, a great player, but he will say “come on”. ‘(Per) Mertesacker’s been more verbal this year. I had a go at Per at the beginning of the season and said: “You don’t have to be Mr Nice Guy, you don’t have to be liked.” You don’t just go through your career letting it go by and missing the moment.’ Adams believes Wenger had ‘10 easy years’ in his first decade at Arsenal, having inherited that famous back five and an ‘unbelievable squad’ of players ‘ready to be taught’. The 47-year-old thinks the Frenchman should sign a new contract at the club, regardless of the outcome at Wembley, but disagrees with Wenger’s optimism about the potential of his squad to win Europe’s most glittering prize. Leaders: Both Arteta (left) and Mertesacker (right) have had to learn to be more assertive this season . ‘I think Arsene really wants to win the Champions League,’ says Adams, ‘and I think he still thinks this group of players can do it for him. While he’s still got that belief, he’ll stick around. ‘If he thought that this squad couldn’t win him the Champions League I think he’d move on to Barcelona or a club that would deliver that for him before he goes to Paris Saint-Germain. ‘Do I share that optimism? No, I don’t. I don’t think the full backs are good enough. They’ve really struggled this year. ‘But I think Arsene should stay. I think, financially, he does fantastic for the club and there’s a great structure in place and better the devil you know. ‘He came in to take over an unbelievable squad, with an untapped French market, and he found a captain who had sobered up six weeks ago and was ready to grab life, instead of grabbing a pint, so a lot of his circumstances are to do with timing. ‘When the teacher appeared, that team was ready to run. I think he had 10 easy years, really.’ In conjunction with The European Azerbaijan Society and to mark World Refugee Week, Tony Adams is promoting a gala charity boxing night at York Hall, East London, on Friday 27th June. Tickets are available at www.Repton-Gabala.eventbrite.co.uk and proceeds will go to the Mo Farah Foundation.","Former Arsenal captain had to answer players' questions on winning .

"A woman in China has been slammed online after she prevented firefighters from breaking the window of her luxury car in order to rescue her trapped three-year-old son. 
  
 China's state broadcaster CCTV reported that the incident, which occurred in the city of Yiwu in Zhejiang province last Saturday (July 11), triggered an outpouring of anger on social media. 
  
 Large crowds had gathered after hearing the boy's cries of help coming from within the BMW, but were surprised to find his unperturbed mother standing outside the car. 
  
 With the boy growing visibly weaker as he clawed in vain against the car window, firefighters attempted to break the window but were stopped by the mother. 
  
 An eyewitness said the mother insisted that they wait for a locksmith to unlock the car door as she did not want to damage the car. But the firefighters ignored her and ended up smashing the window to rescue her son. 
  
 ""It is very dangerous to leave kids inside the car, especially in such heat,"" one firefighter was quoted as saying. 
  
 ""The temperature inside the car can soar in a very short time and threaten the child's life."" 
  
 Netizens expressed shock and disgust at the woman's actions. 
  
 One wrote sarcastically: ""Looks like the car window is her real son."" ||||| BMW logos are displayed on a production line in Berlin. Reuters 
  
 This post has been updated since it was first published. See note below. 
  
 China’s Internet has lit up with debate this week after reports of a mother who left her young son alone in her BMW – then refused to smash the luxury car’s windows in order to rescue him from the heat. 
  
 The mother, who has not been named in Chinese news reports, has since denied that she opposed smashing the window and says that she tried to break it herself, to no avail.

 The incident took place last Saturday night, when firefighters in the city of Yiwu in coastal Zhejiang province received a call alerting them that a child was locked inside a BMW, according to the Zhejiang Online provincial news site. 
  
 When the firefighters arrived, they found a young boy sitting in the driver’s seat of the car, crying and prying at the glass, the report said, citing one of the rescuers. The child had already been trapped in the car for about an hour, it said, and two locksmiths were already at work trying to open the door, while a large crowd was gathered around watching. 
  
 According to Zhejiang Online, the firefighters began to negotiate with the child’s mother, who urged them to wait for the locksmiths to open the door. After several minutes they were still unsuccessful, and the crowd began to condemn the mother. Finally, the report said, the firefighters insisted on smashing the glass, saving the frightened child. 
  
 Days after the initial report, the mother told the Qianjiang Evening News that the incident had been misunderstood. In an interview published Wednesday, she said that she had tried to break the window using a stone and hammer, and then called the police after her efforts failed. She maintained that she had hoped the locksmiths could open the door as the breaking glass could frighten or injure her 17-month-old son trapped inside. 
  
 The Hangzhou-based newspaper also quoted a firefighter who defended the mother and said the confusion could have arisen because she “didn’t say anything” when he initially asked for permission to break the window. 
  
 Photos posted online by the website showed large crowds of onlookers blocking a main street as they gathered around a fire engine and the black luxury car. 
  
 On China’s Weibo microblogs – where reports of the incident had received more than 7.6 million views as of Thursday afternoon – users responded with fury to the initial report, with many arguing that the mother’s behavior was an example of values gone awry in modern China. 
  
 “It’s clear that for this mother, a car is more important than her child,” one Weibo user wrote. 
  
 “Leaving a child trapped in a car on such a hot summer day, and then refusing to smash the window? Do you really want your child to suffocate?” wrote another. 
  
 Remarked another: “If you encounter this kind of situation, the answer is simple: First smash up the parents, then smash the glass.” 
  
 After the mother’s defense, however, some users directed their rage at the media, arguing that the tale was only the latest case of a news story being blown out of proportion. 
  
 “Some journalists know that ‘Dog Bites Man’ isn’t really news, so they try to rewrite it as ‘Man Bites Dog,’” one Weibo user wrote Thursday morning. “In the end they just cause a big stir.” 
  
 China has experienced dazzling economic growth in recent years, and with it has come soul-searching over whether public values have now shifted toward the pursuit of material wealth at any cost. 
  
 Owners of glitzy cars have become a particular scourge, with 80% of respondents in a Hurun Research Institute survey last year saying that they had heard negative news reports involving drivers of luxury vehicles. 70% of the bad publicity was related to BMW owners, the survey said.

  ||||| Chinese drivers of BMW cars are seen as newly rich, materialistic showoffs by drivers of other luxury brands. Yet such owners consider themselves relatively discreet entrepreneurs with a positive outlook on life. 
  
 That’s just one of the findings of a survey of luxury car owners in China published Wednesday. 
  
 The survey, conducted by wealth research firm Hurun Research Institute, compared the images of eight foreign luxury brands vying for a spot in the country’s luxury car market, which is widely expected to overtake the U.S. to become the world’s biggest in the next few years. 
  
 But an anticorruption drive by the Chinese government is changing how those living the high life are perceived by a Chinese public that increasingly frowns on ostentatious displays of wealth. 
  
 According to the report, 80% of all respondents had heard negative news about luxury car owners, which in years past have included a famous 2011 incident in which one BMW owner, son of a famous military singer, attacked a couple during a road rage episode. Of the bad publicity, 70% was related to BMW owners. 
  
 The survey didn’t list similar statistics for other brands. 
  
 BMW didn’t respond to requests for comment Wednesday. 
  
 One hundred car owners for each of the eight brands were surveyed in selected cities across China between February and October. Respondents, of which three-quarters were male, had an average age of 33.5 years and average family income of just over 1 million yuan, or around $175,000. 
  
 The survey found that Audi has the most clearly defined image of all brands, with owners seen as mature, experienced government officials. For some prospective luxury car buyers this can translate into, well, kind of boring. Audi says the days of its brand being closely associated with Chinese bureaucrats have passed and that its image has undergone a transformation toward more vitality. 
  
 Of the leading three German brands that dominate China’s market, the self-image of those who drive Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz aligns very closely with how drivers of other luxury cars perceive them—namely, as successful, cultured entrepreneurs. 
  
 For what it’s worth, Mercedes drivers also had the highest income among participants. 
  
 The image of more recent entrants into China’s luxury car market is also becoming more defined. 
  
 Jaguar Land Rover’s sport-utility drivers are seen as young showoffs with new money, the survey found. Land Rover owners had the lowest level of education among survey participants. JLR said Land Rover caters to a broad range of customers in China with diverse backgrounds. 
  
 General Motor’s Cadillac drivers were seen as mature and successful (so much for that young, trendy image GM has been spending heavily to cultivate for the brand—from hiring actor Brad Pitt for advertising campaigns to hosting glamorous launch parties on Shanghai’s iconic Bund and sponsoring funky art installations.) 
  
 Infiniti drivers were seen as glitzy, glamorous movie-star types whom China Real Time reckons probably need to wait tables by day–Infiniti owners had the lowest income among those surveyed. Infiniti said it targets young-minded premium customers. 
  
 As for Volvo? Drivers of the Chinese-owned Swedish brand are seen as—yawn–highly educated, valuable members of society who are family-oriented and morally upright.

 As China Cracks Down on Illegal Videos, Lovers of Foreign TV Mourn |||||","– A mother in China is getting a social-media lashing after her young son became trapped in her BMW and she reportedly wouldn't let rescuers smash the car's windows to save him, the Wall Street Journal reports. Per local media, firefighters responding to a call of a child locked in a car Saturday in the city of Yiwu found the boy—IDed as 17 months old, though the Straits Times says he's 3—""sitting in the driver's seat of the car, crying and prying at the glass,"" the Journal notes. Locksmiths were already trying to open the door to save the boy, who had reportedly been trapped by that point for about an hour. But as the boy's condition appeared to worsen, firefighters mentioned breaking the windows, and a witness tells the Straits Times the boy's mom balked at that idea, pleading with firefighters to let the locksmiths keep trying instead. The firefighters, however, opted to smash the window and retrieve the child. Comments on China's Weibo site were not kind. ""Looks like the car window is her real son,"" one user posted, per the Straits Times, while the Journal cites another commenter saying, ""The answer is simple: First smash up the parents, then smash the glass."" The outrage may also be tied to deep-seated biases against drivers of luxury cars in China: According to a survey last year, ""Chinese drivers of BMW cars are seen as newly rich, materialistic showoffs by drivers of other luxury brands,"" the Journal notes. The mom has since told local media that she tried to break the window herself and that she simply didn't want the breaking glass to scare or hurt her child. And not everyone's blaming her. ""Some journalists know that 'Dog Bites Man' isn't really news, so they try to rewrite it as 'Man Bites Dog,'"" one Weibo user wrote this morning. (A mom reportedly left her kids in a hot car while in court for the same crime.)"

Andrew Barratt, 49, was jailed for 15 months while his wife Michelle (left) was given 120 hours' unpaid work . Barratt, a postman for 14 years, was arrested in his uniform and has now been sacked. He was jailed for 15 months after admitting theft and converting criminal property. His wife was given 120 hours' unpaid work after pleading guilty to converting criminal property. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Judge Leslie Hull said they had run 'a thoroughly dishonest scheme'. Barratt was arrested in his uniform and has now been sacked from his position as a postman at Royal Mail . Most of the items had been sent out by Amazon – which had reported around 2,000 lost packages in the postcodes where Barratt worked. An eBay account under the name 'ShellB76' run by Mrs Barratt was found to have sold 463 items – most of them electrical goods – since June 2010. Their retail value was almost £21,000. Two of the items – a camcorder and a Sony Walkman – had been reported stolen to police. She told detectives she had bought the items at car boot sales, despite the fact many of the sales were computer games which had been released just days earlier. The couple eventually pleaded guilty on the day of their trial. Defending Mr Barratt, Milena Bennett said he had stolen the goods while 'self-medicating' psoriasis with cannabis and amphetamines. A Royal Mail spokesman confirmed Barratt was sacked and said they seek to prosecute any members of staff who tampers with mail. He said: 'Royal Mail has a zero tolerance approach to any dishonesty and that stance is shared by the overwhelming majority of postmen and women. 'We will not allow the actions of any individual to damage the good reputation of our thousands of hard-working postmen and women. 'It is a criminal offence to tamper with or delay the delivery of mail and anyone caught doing so will face serious disciplinary measures. 'Royal Mail will always seek to prosecute the tiny minority of people who abuse their position of trust.'","Postman Andrew Barratt took about 400 items such as satnavs and iPads .

"(CNN) -- Spanish La Liga side Malaga have continued their recruitment drive with the purchases of French midfielder Jeremy Toulalan from Lyon and experienced Dutch central defender Joris Mathijsen from Hamburg. The 27-year-old Toulalan, who represented France at both Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup finals, has agreed a four-year contract and will be presented by the club at the end of June. He joined Lyon from Nantes in 2006 for $10.5 million, and is a regular for his country -- winning 36 international caps. German striking legend Klose completes move to Lazio . Meanwhile, Mathijsen, 31, spent five successful seasons at Hamburg and has won 72 caps for the Netherlands, playing in last year's World Cup final defeat by Spain. Malaga are owned by Qatari billionaire Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani, who has invested a lot of money into the squad, since purchasing the club in June 2010. They flirted with relegation last season before finishing 11th in the table and coach Manuel Pellegrini has brought in the likes of Ruud van Nistelrooy, Julio Baptista, Enzo Maresca and Martin Demichelis over the past year to launch a challenge for a Europa League place this season. Meanwhile, Premier League side Newcastle have made their second summer signing with the capture of Senegalese striker Demba Ba from relegated West Ham. Ba, 26, had a clause in his contract which allowed him to move on if West ham were relegated, and he joins French midfielder Yohan Cabaye in arriving at St James' Park. The signing makes some amends for Newcastle, who this week lost club captain Kevin Nolan, ironically to West Ham. The 28-year-old Nolan, the highest scoring midfielder in the Premier League last season with 12 goals, signed a five-year deal with the London side to be reunited once again with his former manager at Bolton, Sam Allardyce.","Malaga complete double signing of Jeremy Toulalan and Joris Mathijsen .

"Whether it's being used as a swanky party venue, floating showroom or private vessel, the Xhibitionist is certainly a boat designed to turn heads. The 75 metre long vessel is an extravagant, multipurpose yacht which even comes with its own supercar. Designed by Swedish-based car designer Eduard Gray, the slick ship's interior is decked out in Art Nouveau decor, with classic touches like a Steinway piano, a dual staircase, and fine crystal Baccarat lighting. But you'll need Bruce Wayne's bank account if you want to buy one. The lead-in price is 2 million euros (£16million) for a 'basic' model. Keeping with its automotive theme, the Xhibitionist has space for a car showroom and 'engine room', complete with exposed engines displayed behind glass walls. Solar panels fold out from under a sleek car-hood-like deck to power the ship, and the panels double up as a concert space or helipad with space for three helicopters. The fly deck even features a Jacuzzi, and by night, the superyacht glows in the dark thanks to oceanLED lighting. As for the Xhibitionist's price?

"(CNN) -- NASA says its latest Mars-exploring spacecraft is on track to fire up its thrusters and enter orbit this Sunday night, completing a 10-month journey of 442 million miles. NASA's MAVEN craft will live up to its formal name -- the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution craft -- by helping scientists figure out how ancient Mars changed so dramatically into the planet we know today. It will be the first mission devoted to studying the upper Martian atmosphere as a key to understanding the history of Mars' climate, water and habitability. Mars rover reaches key destination; 'new science ahead!' ""The evidence shows that the Mars atmosphere today is a cold, dry environment, one where liquid water really can't exist in a stable state,"" said Bruce Jakosky, MAVEN principal investigator, during a mission preview briefing Wednesday at NASA headquarters in Washington. ""But it also tells us when we look at older surfaces, that the ancient surfaces had liquid water flowing over it."" So where did the planet's water and carbon dioxide go? Jakosky said MAVEN will help unravel that mystery by using its scientific instruments to measure the composition and escape of gases in the Martian atmosphere. MAVEN will study the top of the atmosphere to determine the extent to which losing gas to space might have been the driving mechanism behind climate change, Jakosky said. Before MAVEN can begin its year of exploration, it has to be inserted into orbit around Mars. That is set to happen at about 10 p.m. ET September 21. The craft's six thruster engines will fire and burn for 33 minutes to slow the spacecraft down so it can get pulled into orbit around Mars. MAVEN will have company out near Mars, manmade and otherwise. India's first mission to the Red Planet, the Mars Orbiter Mission, is set to arrive a few days after MAVEN does. The director of NASA's Planetary Science Division, Jim Green, says the United States and India are interested in cooperating as their crafts gather data about the planet. There's a visitor of the cosmic kind, too. Comet Sliding Spring, which was discovered last year, will be closest to Mars about four weeks after MAVEN arrives. The comet is going to miss Mars by about 81,000 miles, said Jakosky. ""I'm told that the odds of having an approach that close to Mars are about one-in-a-million years,"" he said, adding that dust from the comet carries only a ""relatively minimal"" risk to the spacecraft. MAVEN will take advantage of the rare flyby by observing the comet itself, as well as its effect on the Martian atmosphere.

Despite getting pregnant in her last year at college, Karlesha Thurman, 25, stayed in school and completed her accounting degree. At her graduation from Long Beach State University in California last month, she brought along her three-month-old daughter Aaliyah. A photo of Karlesha Thurman, 25, breastfeeding at her graduation from Long Beach State University in California last month has provoked a storm of online debate and once again brought the contentious issue to the fore . After the ceremony, Karlesha was proudly showing off her daughter to friends when Aaliyah became hungry. Still dressed in her cap and gown, Karlesha decided to feed her baby and a friend, who thought it cool, asked if they could take a picture. A couple of days ago she posted the photo on the Facebook page, Black Women Do Breastfeed, to support a woman who wrote of getting dirty looks while nursing in public. ‘I did it to show it’s natural, it’s normal, there’s nothing wrong with it,’ Karlesha told Today. Despite getting pregnant in her last year at college, Karlesha Thurman, 25, remained in school and secured an accounting degree, she graduated from Long Beach State University in California last month .

'It’s not disgusting, it’s not a bad thing, it’s not a negative thing. It’s the best thing for my daughter. More people should do it,' she added. Though Karlesha has since deleted her photo, the Facebook group decided to share the photo as part of their efforts to try and normalize breast-feeding in public. ‘Congratulations, mama!!!! Giving her daughter more gifts than one! Isn't this beautiful?! #normalizebreastfeeding,’ read the caption. As the photo spread, the Facebook page – and Karlesha - received a lot of support. 'Congratulations to the mom for graduating & putting your baby 1st,' Michelle Spruill wrote on the group’s Facebook page. Karlesha brought along her three-month-old daughter Aaliyah to her graduation last month . 'I breast-fed all 3 of my babies. I didn't let my babies starve because of how it would make someone else feel. Good job!' As well as support, the photo also drew some negative comments as well. Some people though it was inappropriate and that she should have covered up. 'Maybe I still have sleep in my eyes but did U just see a pic of a chick really breastfeeding during middle of her graduation?' tweeted Moderate. Karlesha, however, has no regrets. ‘I was proud of the fact that not only did I graduate but that I got to share the moment with the one person who is the most important to me and that is my daughter,’ she told Today.","Despite getting pregnant in her last year at college, Karlesha Thurman, 25, remained in school and secured an accounting degree .

"Former deputy prime minister John Prescott said Mr Paisley sr's phone was bugged in his Sunday Mirror column.
He said he was told of the tap on the former DUP leader's phone by then prime minister Tony Blair in 2005.
Former Labour MP Kim Howells has called on Lord Prescott to clarify when, exactly, the alleged tapping happened.
North Antrim MP Ian Paisley jr said his father would always have been careful when speaking on the phone.
""It would have been something that he would have been aware of, because people would have said to him 'be careful with your phone, it's being listened to',"" he told BBC NI's Sunday News programme.
""Finding out who was listening to it is, of course, a different matter, but the suspicion was always there that it was the security services.
""For MI5 or MI6 to be engaged in doing that at the behest of the British prime minister is frankly wrong and now that it's been confirmed by John Prescott, the number two in the government, I think that his government needs to be held to account.""
He added: ""I certainly intend, by way of a point of order, to raise this in parliament on the 18th of April, when parliament reconvenes - I'm not going to let this rest.""
Mr Paisley sr, who went on to become first minister of Northern Ireland, died in 2014.
Prime Minister Harold Wilson introduced the Wilson Doctrine in 1966, which ruled that MPs' communications must not be intercepted by the police and security Â­services.
If an MP was tapped, the prime minister would have to tell parliament.
Writing in his Sunday Mirror column, Mr Prescott said: ""In 2005, when I was deputy PM, I was told by Tony Blair an MP had been tapped in the past without parliament being told.
""I asked him who it was and he told me the MP was the Rev Ian Paisley.
""Downing Street had been told by the interception of communications commissioner, who wanted to name Paisley.
""Tony asked me to discuss the Wilson Doctrine with the speaker of the House of Commons.
""I never told him (the speaker) that an MP had been tapped or that it was Paisley.""
Mr Prescott declined to be interviewed by the BBC.
Former Labour MP Kim Howells who was chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee at Westminster from Autumn 2008 until his retirement in 2010, told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster that questions needed to be asked and, if necessary, these should be put to whoever was prime minister at the time of the alleged tapping.
""I'm not surprised that Ian Paisley wants to know the truth. The country needs the truth as well,"" Mr Howells said.
""If it is true that phone tapping was going on, then Parliament should have been informed about it.""
Mr Howells said phone tapping is allowed if the person who is being watched or listened to is considered to be a threat to national security. I'm not aware that Rev Ian Paisley - I assume in the 2000s - was regarded as a threat to national security.""
He said Lord Prescott should make things clear.
""If there isn't a clear answer very quickly, then there ought to be questions posed to whom ever was the person responsible for doing this at the time and that would be a prime minister.
""Rev Ian Paisley was a prominent figure in British politics. I think the prime minister would have to say yes his phone was tapped or no his phone wasn't.
""This is about trust in the end between the elected government, the executive and the intelligence services.
""The intelligence services don't want to be branded by these conspiracy theory lunatics as some kind of shady alternative government.
""They operate within the law and they will want to be quite clear to all MPs now and to those who served in the past that they weren't objects of surveillance and they weren't being spied upon throughout their political careers.""",DUP MP Ian Paisley jr has said he intends to raise the bugging of his father's phone when parliament reconvenes later this month.

"It means £1.3m of planned cuts will be avoided but other savings will be made.
These include £500,000 by changing the council's policy on sickness absence and a further £500,000 in schools energy incentives.
A Liberal Democrats proposal to save money by cutting the pay of senior councillors was defeated.
SNP councillors had said they would oppose any cuts in funding to services supporting vulnerable people.
The ruling group, made up of independent councillors had proposed cuts in funding for deprived areas, street cleansing, homeless support, women's aid groups and the Blas Music Festival.
They said the savings had been forced on the authority, in part because of the council tax freeze.

Many did so reluctantly, claiming the continued council tax freeze would lead to severe pressure on budgets.

"Reverend Barry Trayhorn told an employment tribunal he had read the verses at HMP Littlehey in Cambridgeshire in 2014.
He was told complaints were made by gay prisoners and alleges he was unfairly dismissed.
His case against the secretary of state for justice continues.
Mr Trayhorn, 51, an ordained Pentecostal Christian minister from Sandy in Bedfordshire, had been working as a gardening supervisor at the prison at Perry near St Neots.
He had been invited to lead the worship at services once a week from 2012.
He told the tribunal in Bedford, he ""often focused on Christian teachings about sin and repentance"".
He confirmed the Bible passage in question was 1 Corinthians Chapter 6 Verses 9-11 which includes the lines ""neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor coveters, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the Kingdom of God"" and he read it on 31 May 2014.
Mr Trayhorn said he heard later that a gay prisoner had complained or was upset and there was ""some sort of campaign"" to remove him from chapel services.
""But I fear and do not believe it is right to alter the Christian faith so as to tailor it to any modern view of sexual ethics,"" he told the hearing.
He said he was told he could no longer volunteer at chapel services, complaints were then also made about his gardening work and he was told to attend a disciplinary hearing in a letter which said he had made a ""homophobic statement"".
He was signed off work in August 2014 with stress and resigned in November saying he had been harassed because of his Christian faith and it was impossible for him to return to work.","A prison minister felt ""compelled"" to resign after a row about ""homophobic"" Bible verses which he read from during services for inmates."
"Ireland started with purpose but went behind when Antonio Cassano headed in a near post Andrea Pirlo corner.
An equaliser would have knocked Italy out and their keeper Gianluigi Buffon smartly saved a Keith Andrews strike.
""I hope there are no dramatic changes for the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign, because you have to remember what a brilliant achievement it was for us to get here in the first place.
""But my fear is what could happen to Giovanni Trapattoni.
""His team has not had the best of tournaments, and if we do not start out well on the road to the next World Cup in Brazil then I fear that people might turn on him.""
I fear for Trapattoni, says Kevin Kilbane
Andrews was sent off for a second booking before Mario Balotelli volleyed in to settle Italian nerves.
Italy still had to endure a few more anxious moments as a Croatia equaliser against Spain in the other Group C game would have meant they were out of the tournament.
But Spain won and Italy will now play the winner of Group D, which includes England.
Ireland put in a more solid performance than in their two previous defeats, although it might not be enough to stop some of their old guard calling time on their international careers, and Shay Given, Robbie Keane, Damien Duff and Richard Dunne will all be left to mull over their futures.
The Irish had beaten Italy 18 years ago to the day at the 1994 World Cup but despite starting with pace and pressuring their opponents, they suffered from some poor decision making in the final third.
Italy weathered the Republic's early enthusiasm before gradually pinning their opponents back and being rewarded for their perseverance.
The opener came after some costly mistakes by Ireland, which started with Glenn Whelan giving the ball away to Italy midfielder Andrea Pirlo.
Pirlo released Antonio Di Natale and he skipped over keeper Given but saw his effort from an acute angle cleared off the line by Sean St Ledger.
Ireland escaped this time but Given, so unusually uncertain at Euro 2012, quickly spilled a long range Cassano strike and the Azzurri seized on the error.
Cassano got his head to a near post Pirlo corner and although Given got a touch, the ball had already crossed the line before Duff - captain on his 100th Republic appearance - cleared.
The goal knocked the wind out of Ireland's sails and Given had to save a Di Natale shot as Italy threatened to overwhelm Giovanni Trapattoni's deflated side.
To their credit, the Republic regrouped and caused Italy some anxious moments, although only a powerful 25-yard shot from Andrews called Buffon into any serious action.
Andrews, already booked in the first half, was sent off after picking up a second yellow card.
He then furiously kicked out at the ball on his way off as he epitomised the frustrations of so many in the Ireland camp after a tournament in which they were comprehensively outplayed.
And Ireland's misery was compounded when Balotelli, side on to goal and with a defender in close attendance, volleyed in from a late corner.

"Universities are paying agencies millions to recruit overseas students who boost their coffers. Home students suffer as lectures are dumbed down to help those with poor English, academics say. And some institutions enrol lucrative non-EU students ‘regardless of their language skills’, it was claimed. A study by Times Higher Education (THE) found 106 universities spent £86million recruiting abroad in 2013 to 2014, or £1,767 per student – a 16.5 per cent increase on two years before. The Russell Group of top universities were some of the top spenders, with Sheffield, Glasgow and Cardiff each spending more than £6million from 2011 to 2014. Coventry spent the most, paying out £10.2million in commission and VAT to recruit 5,634 students, according to data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. However, a university spokesman said: ‘By error the figures . . . included substantial non-agent related costs, and therefore do not represent the university’s spend.’ The University of Bedfordshire spent £9.5million and Middlesex University spent £8.8million including VAT. Giving money to recruitment agents is worthwhile for institutions because the average fee paid by a student from outside the EU last year was £11,289 – or £13,425 for laboratory-based courses. Fees for UK and EU students are capped at £9,000 a year. Liz Reisberg, formerly of the Centre for International Higher Education, at Boston College in the US, and now an independent consultant, told THE the situation was ‘staggering’. Of 158 universities that gave data, all but 19 used agents to enrol non-EU students. At the 124 institutions that gave a breakdown of admissions, there were 58,257 international students enrolled using agents in 2013-14. This month, a separate THE survey found more than a third of academics thought foreign undergraduates did not speak or write good English. One admitted to The Best University Workplace Survey that tutors ‘lower the level of classes so everyone can keep up – to the disadvantage of native speakers’. A Russell Group lecturer called the issue the sector’s ‘dirty little secret’. The average  fee paid by student from outside the EU last year was £11,289 a year to study in the UK . A respondent at a university in the Midlands said it tried ‘to attract as many international students as possible regardless of their language skills.’ As the survey was anonymous, there is no suggestion the complaints came from institutions that pay agencies fees to recruit internationally. Nicola Dandridge, of Universities UK, which represents the sector, said: ‘International students are subject to numerous tests to ensure they meet high English language requirements.’ The group said official guidance puts an onus on universities to ensure agents act ‘ethically and responsibly’.","106 universities spent £86 million recruiting abroad in 2013 to 2014 .

"The independent inspector of immigration said the Home Office must make significant improvements regarding ""overstayers"" - foreign nationals refused leave to stay in the country.
John Vine said failure to do so could ""undermine public confidence"".
Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said there was room for improvement.
The report suggests that the amount of ""overstayers"" in the UK is not increasing, and instead is remaining largely static.
Mr Vine said the overall size of the ""migration refusal pool"" - the number of foreign nationals refused leave to stay in the UK after 2008 - was 173,562 in the three months to June this year, compared with 174,057 in the same period two years earlier.
The Home Office signed a contract with private outsourcing group Capita to review, and where possible, close the records of migrants who had been refused leave to stay in the UK.
But Mr Vine said there had been ""significant inaccuracies"" in Capita's classification of migration refusal records.
The inspection concluded that of a sample of 57 records 16 had wrongly recorded the foreign national as having left the UK.
A Capita spokeswoman rejected claims that it had used information about passengers to the UK incorrectly and that it had incorrectly classified passport records.
She also rejected ""any inference that we benefited in any way"" from following the processes used to record migrants' entry to and exit of the UK.
In his report, Mr Vine specified that what he describes as Capita's inaccuracies meant the number of ""overstayers"" thought to have departed may have been overestimated by as many as 1,140 in 2013-14.
Mr Vine said: ""I was disappointed to find a high level of inaccuracy in the classification of migration refusal records, with more than a quarter of departures in my sample being incorrectly recorded.
""Considerable improvements in the Home Office's capability to monitor, progress, and prioritise the immigration enforcement caseload will be needed to deliver its strategy for reducing the level of irregular migration.""
He said inspectors had also identified a further 223,000 records of foreign nationals without permission to stay in the UK, whose cases dated to before 2008.
James Brokenshire said the report's recommendations would be taken forward, but changes made by the government had been having a positive impact and needed to be judged over time.
""The public can have confidence on the rigour that we are attaching to this issue,"" he said.","The government failed to deal with a backlog of almost 174,000 foreign nationals who should have been removed from the UK, a report has said."
"Vitali Klitschko has confirmed that he will defend his world heavyweight boxing title against former champion Shannon Briggs on October 16 in his adopted home city of Hamburg. The Ukrainian last put his WBC belt up for grabs in May against Albert Sosnowski in what he has said will be his last year as a professional fighter. The 39-year-old, who has successfully defended the crown four times, will face the American, 38, for the first time as he seeks to extend his 40-2 career record. ""I am really happy that I will have a fight in Hamburg again, the place where I started my professional career. The o2 World is a great arena and the fans in Hamburg are real box experts and will make a perfect atmosphere,"" Klitschko told his website. ""Shannon Briggs is not only big at talking but also big in the ring and a very tough challenger. He is more experienced than me, has more professional fights on his record and is one of the hardest punchers in the division. I will be very well prepared together with my trainer Fritz Sdunek."" Briggs, nicknamed ""The Cannon,"" has a record of 51-5 with 45 victories by knockout -- 27 in the first round. He has previously beaten former world champions George Foreman, Ray Mercer and Sergej Liakhovich. ""For a long time I have been trying hard to fight a Klitschko. Most of their opponents are scared to death when they step into the ring. I will put a lot of pressure on Klitschko and take the fight to him. Klitschko can enjoy his belt for a few more weeks; after October 16 it will be mine!"" Klitschko's younger brother Wladimir, the IBF, WBO and IBO champion, will face former WBC titleholder Samuel Peter of Nigeria in another Germany-based bout in Frankfurt on September 11. Britain's WBA beltholder David Haye, who both Klitschkos have accused of being scared to fight them, may next fight former Olympic champion Audley Harrison, according to promoter Barry Hearn. Hearn, whose son Eddie is involved in the talks with Haye's manager Adam Booth, said the fight would be a boost for British boxing. ""In the heavyweight division, there is nothing else out there as far as British fight fans are concerned, Harrison-Haye is enormous,"" he told Sky Sports News. ""The fantastic thing about David Haye is that he's burst on the scene and done a fantastic job against [Nikolay] Valuev, boxed the ears off [John] Ruiz and put him into retirement. He's hot. ""Audley Harrison, in my opinion, is a bigger draw. People don't know what to expect from Audley Harrison, he's been talking a great fight for years, never delivered it. He's at that last-stage saloon -- every fight fan in England wants to see this fight.""","WBC champion Vitali Klitschko will return to adopted home city of Hamburg for defense .

"A mother who claimed her three-year-old daughter was killed in a hit and run incident outside their Florida home has been charged with murder. Maryann Schwartz told police her child, Yeliani, had been run over in the parking lot outside their apartment, but a medical examiner said the girl had died from blunt trauma. Yeliani was also described as being malnourished and both she and her two-year-old brother, who is now in protective custody, were covered in bruises. Arrested: Maryann Schwartz has been charged with murder over the death of her three-year-old daughter . Claims: Schwartz, pictured left in court, told police her daughter was run over and killed by an unknown vehicle . Schwartz had been arrested on Wednesday over child abuse charges relating to her son, but the first-degree murder charge in connection with Yeliani's death was added late last night. The 22-year-old had told police she didn't see her daughter get run over, but claimed that Yeliani had been hit by a vehicle at about 9.30pm on Friday. She called 911 while on her way to the hospital, and was told to pull over and wait for emergency responders. When her daughter was examined at hospital however, doctors said her body was too cold to have fitted with the mother's time frame of events. Highway patrol officers became suspicious of her story, and detectives brought in to work on the case said Yeliani had died in 'suspicious circumstances', according to an incident report seen by the Orlando Sentinel. A report by a medical examiner found the child had died from blunt-force trauma, but it was unable to confirm if the injuries came from being hit by a car. Charges: Schwartz, center, was originally arrested for child after bruises were seen on her surviving child . Schwartz's son was put into protective custody, and three children belonging to her housemate, Vanessa Morales, were put in the care of a relative after police searched the apartment the women shared. 'There were bruises on the children that concerned us and led us to think there was possible physical abuse that occurred,' Kristin Gray, of the Department for Children and Families, said. Hospital staff had contacted the sheriff's department to say Schwartz's son had 'multiple bruises on his body that were not consistent with normal child activities', Local 6 reported. Morales, who is currently allowed only supervised visits with her children, was arrested on Wednesday for unrelated charges after allegedly driving on a suspended license.","Doctors claim girl's body was too cold to have died when Maryann Schwartz said she did .

"By . Deni Kirkova . The perfect wine as voted for by UK wine-lovers would be red, produced in Australia, and cost just £5.83. The ideal bottle for convenience-led Britons would also feature a screw top and be on offer at a discounted price or as part of a multi-buy promotion. The characteristics of the perfect tipple are unearthed thanks to new research into British beverage-buying habits. Almost 40 per cent prefer a glass of rouge, compared to 35 per cent who would choose white . British vino drinkers would also want their beverage available to buy at the supermarket, and to be made by a popular, known brand. Red wine narrowly beat white as the nation's favourite, with almost 40 per cent preferring a glass of rouge, compared to the 35 per cent who chose white. Rosé ranked in third place after drawing less than a fifth of the vote (19 per cent). While European wine from heavyweight producer countries like France, Spain and Italy remained well liked, New World wine - especially that from Australia - was revealed to be leagues ahead in the popularity stakes, with 1 in 5 declaring a preference for booze from down under. When it comes to splashing the cash (or not), UK shoppers are prepared to pay, on average, £5.83 for a bottle, with 7 in 10 unwilling to spend more than £6.

'While public confidence and spending is on the up, shoppers' purse strings are still tight so it's no surprise that they're looking for an affordable treat in the form of a bargain bottle - most likely one that's on offer. 'What's interesting is that shoppers are now demanding great value wine from far flung producer countries. 'As supply chain technologies advance and overseas producers begin to embrace the cost benefits of bottling in the UK, we'll begin to see even more top notch yet affordable New World wine hit our shelves.'

Water-carved rocks high on a Martian mountain have revealed that Nasa's Curiosity rover could actually be driving through a giant dried up lake bed. The new finding comes from Gale Crater, where NASA's Curiosity rover landed in 2012.

Lower right inset shows detail of boxwork formation (scale bar represents 50¿meters).  Gale crater is 155¿km in diameter for scale. Researchers believe the telltale patterns could only have been made by water - meaning the mountain was once surrounded by a giant lake. 'Detailed mapping of the filled fracture network on Mount Sharp indicates that this sedimentary layer most likely represents large-scale boxwork fabricsm' they say in the journal Journal of Geological Research: Planets. 'These deposits provide evidence for extensive and relatively rapid cement formation, which could be beneficial to the preservation of organic compounds, 1050 m above the current floor of Gale Crater.' By studying images of the surface, the team were even able to estimate how big the giant lake was. 'Volumes of diagenetic cements can be measured from orbital imagery, and based on these measurements and an assumed chemistry, the minimum volume of water required to form the cements measured was calculated to be about 0.4 km3.'

"President Trump is expected to announce that Wall Street financier Anthony Scaramucci will be White House communications director, according to two sources familiar with the planning. 
  
 Trump has left the role open since Mike Dubke resigned in May, and the President has vented frequently to his friends about the performance of his press operation. 
  
 Trump's plans to appoint Scaramucci came as a surprise to Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who found out after the plans had already been made. ||||| We've detected that JavaScript is disabled in your browser. Would you like to proceed to legacy Twitter?

 The Trump administration is expected to name former Trump transition team official Anthony Scaramucci as White House communications director, four sources in and close to the White House told NBC News Thursday. 
  
 The news of the expected appointment was first reported by Axios. A White House official said the move is expected to be announced Friday. Scaramucci did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
  
 A different White House official described Scaramucci to NBC News as a ""total professional"" with the respect of President Donald Trump. Scaramucci was a supporter of Trump's during the campaign, dealing with fundraising and appearing on cable TV as a frequent defender of the president.

 Prior to throwing his support behind Trump, Scaramucci was a Scott Walker and then a Jeb Bush booster. 
  
 Scaramucci met with Trump and his daughter Ivanka in the Oval Office on Thursday where Trump offered him the job, a source with knowledge of the situation said. The source said Trump has known Scaramucci for years and likes him. 
  
 ""Comms is what Anthony does,” the source said. “It's how he built his business. The guy knows media. He's been a good advocate for the president."" 
  
 White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has technically been doing double duty as press secretary and communications director since the departure of communications director Mike Dubke, who resigned in May after just three months on the job. Spicer has not responded to a request for comment.

 The Long Island-born financier and loyalist to President Donald Trump was appointed chief strategy officer of the Export-Import Bank last week — roughly five months after his first promised White House gig failed to materialize. 
  
 “Mr. Scaramucci’s main role is to assess how the Export-Import Bank can better capitalize upon opportunities to support American jobs by financing American exports,” a spokesperson for the bank said Tuesday. 
  
 It is Scaramucci’s third attempt to land a gig with the Trump administration. In January, Scaramucci, known in the hedge-fund crowd as “The Mooch,” was said to have landed a role with the White House Office of Public Engagement, but the role disappeared after he sold his company, SkyBridge Capital, to foreign buyers. 
  
 Earlier this month, it was reported that Scaramucci was up for the role of ambassador to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The job, which needs Senate approval and a move to Paris, may still be in play. 
  
 Scaramucci’s new role with the Ex-Im Bank, which was first reported by Politico, is not without irony. 
  
 While campaigning, Trump called the bank “excess baggage.” 
  
 But the president changed his tune in April, telling the Wall Street Journal that the bank is “a very good thing. And it actually makes money, it could make a lot of money.” 
  
 The bank, which has been called “corporate welfare” by other Republican critics, provides financing for US exports when other, more traditional lenders may be unwilling to assume the risk. |||||","– It's been nearly two months since Mike Dubke left the Trump administration, and his communications director role has remained empty since. That's apparently about to change. Four sources said to be ""in and close to the White House"" confirm to NBC News an earlier report by Axios that Wall Street financier Anthony Scaramucci—""Mooch"" to those close to him—is set to be named as Dubke's replacement. The announcement could come Friday. A source tells NBC Scaramucci was at the White House Thursday, where he met with Trump and Ivanka Trump and was offered the job. That source adds Trump has long known Scaramucci, 53, who stumped for Trump during the campaign and has been ""a good advocate for the president."" He also defended Donald Trump Jr. on Twitter regarding the latter's June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer. Still, NBC notes Scaramucci wasn't initially Team Trump: He first lent his support to Scott Walker, then Jeb Bush in the primaries portion of the presidential campaign. Scaramucci was appointed by Trump last month to a position with the Export-Import Bank, a position he'll vacate if the comm director one becomes official. One White House insider who was apparently thrown by the news of Scaramucci's impending appointment: chief of staff Reince Priebus, who Axios says found out about his potential new colleague only after the decision had been made. Meanwhile, press secretary Sean Spicer, who's been taking care of Dubke's responsibilities since he left, is expected to remain on staff, but it's ""unclear"" exactly what he'll be doing, Axios notes."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:08 PM on 2nd December 2011 . Brooke is 7 years old and weighs just 45 pounds. But over the course of four months, a medical clinic being paid with state dollars prescribed her a cocktail of anti-psychotic drugs that her family doctor says could be dangerous even for an adult. The drugs didn't fix her temper tantrums and bad moods. Instead, they made her problems worse. And when she tried to go off of them, she became almost uncontrollable. Brooke is just one of millions of foster children across the country who have been prescribed unprecedented levels of powerful mind-altering drugs in an often misguided attempt to control the emotional problems these kids experience after watching their families break apart. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . No solution: The heavy doses of dangerous drugs didn't make Brooke's problems better... they made them worse . ABC News reports that foster kids are 13 times more likely to receive 'mind-altering' psychotropic drugs than other children. Taxpayer-funded clinics have even prescribed the drugs, which are often approved only for adult use, to infants. Brooke was already facing an uphill battle to having a healthy childhood. Her mother was a drug dealer and a prostitute. Brooke was placed in a foster home at an early age, removed from her broken family and given to the care of strangers. The freckle-faced redhead counted 10 drugs that she was prescribed to control her temper tantrums and bad moods. But they didn't help, so doctors at the clinic in Florida continued increasing her doses. When foster mom Lisa Ward objected to the heavy medication, she was told that if she didn't follow the instructions of the state-sponsored doctors, Brooke could be taken away from her and placed with another foster family. Happy endings: After Brooke got off the medications, things turned better for her. Her foster mother adopted her and she's learning to deal with her problems . Finally Ms Ward paid to send Brooke to a private doctor. What he saw horrified him: 'The first thing we've got to think about, ""Is the medicine causing this?""' asked psychiatrist Dr Luis Quinones. But now, after a painful process of weening herself off the drugs, Brooke is better. Ms Ward and her husband adopted the 7-year-old and she has a new solution her her problems. 'What's another choice over a tantrum? What's a good choice?' Ms Ward recently asked her adopted daughter. 'To hug you,' Brooke replied. The problem has reached the ears of legislators in Washington, who heard testimony from some of foster children affected by this trend. Ke'onte, 12, tells Congress that he was wrongly diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD and given four different medications that left him in a 'stupor' A 12-year-old boy bravely told how he was medicated into a near-stupor as he was passed between foster care homes. The seventh grader, known only as Ke'onte, told Congress that being given the mind-altering drugs was 'the worst thing anyone could do to foster kids'. He revealed that he could barely eat while on the medication and was so exhausted 'it felt like I would collapse wherever I was in the house'. 'I think putting me on all these stupid meds was the stupidest thing I’ve ever experienced in foster care,' he said. Medicated: The Government study found children in foster care were 13 times more likely to be on anti-pyschotics and anti-depressants than other children . Ke'onte's plight came to light as a Government Accountability Office report was released that found the federal government had not done enough to oversee the treatment of foster children with powerful drugs. The study found cared-for children were up to 13 times more likely to be prescribed anti-psychotics and anti-depressants than other children. Ke'onte, who was adopted in 2009, said he had tantrums as a foster child and was inaccurately diagnosed as bipolar and having ADHD. 'I’ve been in the mental hospital three times during foster care, and every time I had to get on more meds or new meds to add to the ones I was already taking,' he said. He was on four different types of medication during his four years in six foster care and the drugs made him feel irritable, gave him stomach aches and affected his appetite, reports ABC. 'I remember having a bowl of spaghetti and had three bites and then I was done,' he said. He has since been taken off the medication and given therapy, and is thriving. He plays clarinet in the school band, competes in cross-country and has had roles in the school play. He said: 'In therapy, you talk about the deepest thing and it hurts, but you can deal with it better the next time. 'I’m not only more focused in school… I’m not going to the office anymore for bad behavior and I’m happy.' video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player .","Government report finds foster children are 13 times more likely to be heavily medicated .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Every year, I take at least one vacation out of the country to get my international travel fix. And this time, I'm taking you with me. The travel bug is a forever-itch that leaves you longing to wake up in a foreign country, Jarrett Bellini says. No, not literally. Sit down. This year, YOU can weigh in on where I go and what I do once I get there. We're calling it: Let's Ruin Jarrett's Vacation! By adding your comments below or sharing your ideas on CNN.com Live's Facebook page, you can send me to either Argentina, Greece, South Africa or Turkey. The destination that gets the most positive response is where I'll go. And to make it more fun, I won't even find out where I'm heading until I actually get to the airport this Sunday, August 30. There, I will tear open an envelope, read the results for the first time, and then head to my departure gate -- hopefully with at least a few articles of appropriate clothing. Once I get to wherever it is you send me, I'll be blogging on CNN.com and and checking in from time to time on CNN.com Live. By sharing your ideas on Facebook, you'll be able to guide many aspects of this vacation. You call the shots. And I'll cry myself to sleep at night wondering why I agreed to work on vacation and let other people plan it. I suppose, now, you might want a little background on why I'd actually want to do this. I mean, besides the fact that clearly, I'm a glutton for punishment. Really, though, I think I just like a challenge. In the fall of 2003, after an entire month of fruitlessly waiting by my phone to hear back about an entry-level position with CNN, I finally gave up hope and took my apparent job snub as some sort of cosmic sign from the Slacker Gods. I decided, then, that the only reasonable course of action was to buy a plane ticket to Europe to spend the next three months running around with my backpack, trying -- again, quite fruitlessly -- to meet foreign chicks. Though not quite a rucksack Casanova, I did come back from these magical three months with a far greater ability to entertain myself in a completely new place among absolute strangers. (Granted, for me, this can be accomplished by the presence of shiny objects.) Amazingly, the day after I returned from Europe, CNN called and offered me the position. It took four long months, but the timing was remarkable and I couldn't have been happier. But, as I started my new professional life, I was sick. I had the travel bug. Now, this is not to be confused with bed bugs, which, FYI, I painfully fell victim to in Copenhagen at a horrible, bomb-shelter-of-a-hostel they call Sleep in Heaven. Apparently, Heaven smells like mildew and leaves you with a rash. No, this was the travel bug -- the forever-itch that leaves you longing to wake up in a foreign bed in a foreign country, rising to face new ideas and new people beneath an unfamiliar sky. Of course, that's just my poorly poetic way of saying: The world is huge and amazing. It's so good! Once it hits your lips, it's so good!","Jarrett Bellini offers readers opportunity to decide where he's going on vacation .

"The My Dentist practice in Dolgellau will close on 31 March and the town's other practice is private.
A spokesman for the NHS practice said it had been unable to recruit a permanent dentist in the last two years
The deputy mayor of Dolgellau, Delwyn Evans, told BBC Radio Cymru's Post Cyntaf programme more needed to be done to get dentists into rural areas.
My Dentist clinical director Steve Williams said: ""There is a shortage of dentists in parts of rural Wales where long-term unfilled vacancies persist over a significant period of time.
""We have tried unsuccessfully to recruit a dentist for the last two years and, regretfully, can no longer provide services at the Mervinian House Family Dental Practice.""
A spokesman for Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board said it intended to re-commission dental services in the area as soon as possible.
""However, there is likely to be a gap between the date of termination of the existing services and the completion of the tender exercise and the re-establishment of new services,"" he said.
""We are therefore making arrangements for the provision of dental services on a cover basis until a permanent solution can be put in place.
""This will include exploring options for short-term support from the other nearest practices, as well as a dental out-of-hours clinic to operate from Dolgellau Community Hospital for patients requiring urgent unscheduled care.""
A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""When a dentist decides to reduce or end their NHS commitment, the associated funding remains with the health board to re-commission the service.
""Betsi Cadwaladr UHB has invited applications from dental contractors to help ensure there are NHS services available in the area.
""We expect the health board to continue to review and improve access to NHS primary care dental services through the targets set within its 2016-17 Operational Plan.""","Nearly 4,500 patients will lose their only NHS dentist in a Gwynedd town from the end of the month."

"By . Chris Greenwood . When they first met, he was brandishing a large knife and his victim was bravely trying to defend his family business with a stool. But after being caught red-handed career criminal Oluwatobi Ogunbanwo adopted a somewhat different approach. In an extraordinary hand-written letter from prison, he begged for forgiveness from shopkeeper Eamon McCluskey and offered his ‘humblest apologies’. Forgiven: In this image taken from the CCTV footage of the robbery, Mr McCluskey can be seen defending himself against armed robber Oluwatobi Ogunbanwo . The armed robber went on to say that a ‘hardworking taxpayer’ deserves to be able to make a ‘decent living’ without the crook ‘taking what is yours’. The letter was passed to Mr McCluskey by police after Ogunbanwo was jailed for eight years for a robbery spree. He struck at his newsagent in Wimbledon Park, South West London, as Mr McCluskey was about to shut up shop for the night in February. Wearing a mask over the lower half of his face and armed with a knife, he leapt on the counter screaming at the business owner to hand over his takings. His terrified 51-year-old victim grabbed a stool which he used to fend off the attacker as he tried to escape and shouted for help. 'I'm sorry I robbed you with a butcher's knife': Oluwatobi Ogunbanwo, 22, wrote this letter of apology to Mr McCluskey for robbing his newsagent in Wimbledon Park, South West London . Attack: During the robbery, Mr McCluskey defended himself with a stool and threw beer bottles at the young criminal as he jumped over the counter bearing a knife . Ogunbanwo climbed over the counter and removed the till from the shop, making off with £60 which police found on his person when they arrested hm a short time later . But Ogunbanwo blocked him in behind the counter and Mr McCluskey threw bottles of beer at him in a desperate last attempt at self-defence. At that point robber wrenched the entire till off its base and fled down the street, where he had stashed his coat under a parked car. Mr McCluskey’s 78-year-old mother was in the back of the shop and ‘had the shock of her life’ when she came to see what all the commotion was about. Luckily, police were alerted by vigilant neighbours within seconds of the start of the robbery and intercepted the robber less than a mile away. He stole just £60 which was found in his pockets. The horrifying ordeal was caught on . CCTV camera and was the latest in three similar raids in three years at . the cornershop, which Mr McCluskey’s parents opened in 1962. The businessman was so upset by the robbery that he attended Kingston Crown Court to see the young criminal jailed. Afterwards, a detective approached him and passed him the neatly written letter from the defendant. In it, Ogunbanwo said: ‘A hardworking . tax-payer like yourself deserves to be able to make a decent living . without myself taking what is yours and has not business to do with me. ‘I . apologise for any distress I caused your mother or yourself and for any . further damaged caused. I genuinely had no intention to harm you in any . way, but that is still no excuse for my action or for any fear I may . have caused. ‘My mother works in Tesco and I could only imagine how angry I would be if somebody did that to her.’ Big heart: Eamon McCluskey, pictured at his shop in Wimbledon, has said he forgives the robber for what he did after his letter . Speaking last night, Mr McCluskey, 51, said it took him two days to open the letter but he believes the apology is genuine. ‘When I came out of court a police . officer said he had written me a letter. It was early and I was very . upset. I didn’t read it for a few days. Dear Mr Eamon McCluskey, . Before I go any further please let me express my humblest apologies in regards to the robbery that took place at your store. A hardworking tax-payer like yourself deserves to be able to make a decent living without myself taking what is yours and has not business to do with me. I apologise for any distress I caused your mother or yourself and for any further damaged caused. I genuinely had no intention to harm you in any way, but that is still no excuse for my action or for any fear I may have caused. My mother works in Tesco and I could only imagine how angry I would be if somebody did that to her. Both my actions and behaviour towards you were cruel and I sincerely apologise for that. Yours sincerely. Tobi Ogunbanwo . ‘Maybe he was remorseful about the robbery. He wanted to apologise for what he had done. I’m sure he meant it.’ Mr McCluskey said the 22-year-old robber had only been out of prison for 10 days after serving a shorter sentence for similar crimes. He described him as a ‘serial offender’ and said the court was told he had been committing serious crimes since the age of 18. Describing the robbery, the shopkeeper said he had recently installed panic buttons and a remote door lock but had become ‘blasé’. He said: ‘I saw the knife as soon as he came in the door. 'He had a mask on his nose like a motorbike mask and he had a butcher’s knife raised in his right hand. ‘He came to the counter and I went to the security door to get out but he got there before I did. 'I thought ""I have to get out of here or he will kill me or do me harm.’’ He said: ‘I am glad it’s over now - time is a healer and everything is back to normal now.’ Ogunbanwo, known as Tobi, of Battersea, admitted four robberies and three attempted robberies across Merton and Wandsworth.","Eamon McCluskey, 51, has forgiven criminal for robbing his newsagent .

"McGuinness must devise a strategy to combat the all-attacking style of the defending champions in their All-Ireland semi-final in Croke Park.
In what is expected to be the most tactical game of the year, McGuinness says the game is ""one hundred per cent about football players"".
""We trust (players) to out and do a job,"" said McGuinness.
""I have been asked about our ability to hold the Dublin half forward line and how that would impact on our half back line. but we trust our half back line to go out and do a job.
""Whenever we have passed the information on that we think is really important for the game, it's up to the players to make the decisions then.
""You give that information, they'll clarify it with you, and try to execute it to the best of their ability.""
McGuinness, who led Donegal to a third Ulster title in four years last month, is unconcerned about being rated as rank 8/1 outsiders on Sunday, despite his team having been All-Ireland champions two years ago.
""We were underdogs in every single game in 2012, so that doesn't make a difference.
""Our approach is the same. It doesn't matter if (bookmakers) sit at a computer and say 'that's the number'.
""No one knows what goes on in our dressing room. You just have to get things right and put faith in the players.

"Former federal MP Craig Thomson has been fined $25,000 for stealing union funds to pay for prostitutes but has avoided going to jail. Thomson, 50, was convicted of 13 counts of theft following cash withdrawals he made from a bank account belonging to the Health Services Union between 2003 and 2007 when he was the union's national secretary. He spent around $5000 of HSU members' fees on escorts and sex workers and lavish meals. In sentencing Thomson on Wednesday, Victorian County Court Judge Carolyn Douglas said his spending had been indulgent and constituted a significant breach of trust. Former federal MP Craig Thomson has been fined $25,000 for stealing union funds to pay for prostitutes but has avoided going to jail . She rejected a submission by Thomson's defence barrister Greg James that the offending was the result of 'the frailties of a man away from home'. One of the charges arose from spending on sexual services while he was at home, and one related to a $400 lunch with his wife that included a $200 bottle of wine. 'The gravity of the offending is the gross breach of trust involved,' Judge Douglas said. 'The seriousness is reflected in the continued confidence, or arrogance, of Mr Thomson in having no regard for the trust placed in him.' She said it was not the concern of the court that he engaged sex workers, but it was the court's concern he was using union members' money to do so. Thomson had appealed against both his 12-month jail sentence and conviction imposed by a Melbourne Magistrate earlier this year . Thomson had appealed against both his 12-month jail sentence and conviction imposed by a Melbourne Magistrate earlier this year. On Monday, he was acquitted of 49 charges of obtaining financial advantage by deception.

She said the amount stolen was relatively small but Thomson's behaviour was nonetheless appalling. 'He is greedy,' Judge Douglas said. Judge Carolyn Douglas said it was regrettable the fraud charges had not been framed correctly and reiterated she would be sentencing on the theft charges only . During submissions on Wednesday morning Judge Douglas indicated she was considering a fine instead of jail time, but prosecutor Lesley Taylor QC called for a prison sentence, saying anything less would be manifestly inadequate. 'The moral culpability of Mr Thomson is extremely high,' Ms Taylor said. 'There is not one skerrick of remorse that Mr Thomson has demonstrated.' Mr James said Thomson's theft of $5000 did not warrant jail time and he had been penalised already. Mr James said media coverage of Thomson's legal battle had been 'extensive and intensive' and so intrusive Thomson and his wife had been unable to leave their home. Thomson has had to take out a $300,000 mortgage and sell superannuation assets to fund his defence against the charges, Mr James said. Thomson has three months to pay the $25,000 fine and must also pay compensation of $5650.","Former federal MP Craig Thomson has been fined $25,000 for misuse of union funds .

"(Mental Floss) -- There's a good chance you'll either drink too much eggnog this holiday season or spend time around someone who has. Here's a look at the background of this December staple. Eggnog can trace its roots back as far as the 14th century, when medieval Englishmen enjoyed a hot cocktail known as posset. Posset didn't contain eggs -- the Oxford English Dictionary describes it as ""a drink made of hot milk curdled with ale, wine, or the like, often sweeten ed and spiced' -- but over the years eggs joined in on the festive fun. While the egg-laden version of posset was popular with the English, it became less common as time went by. Milk and eggs were both scarce and expensive, and the sherry and Madeira used to spike the mixture was pricey, too. Over time, the concoction became a drink that only aristocrats could really afford. All of that changed in the American colonies, though. What we lacked in parliamentary representation we made up for in easy access to dairy products and liquor. Since many Americans had their own chickens and dairy cattle, tossing together a glass of eggnog was no problem, and the drink's popularity soared among the colonists even as it sagged back home. This disparity in the drink's popularity on either side of the pond endures to this day; eggnog's popularity in the United Kingdom. still lags far behind its holiday ubiquity here in the States. In fact, here's how the Guardian's Andrew Shanahan memorably described the drink in 2006: ""People rarely get it right, but even if you do it still tastes horrible. The smell is like an omelette and the consistency defies belief. It lurches around the glass like partially-sentient sludge."" Appetizing! Using your noggin . The word ""eggnog"" itself has fairly murky origins, but many etymologists think the name stems from the word ""noggin,"" which referred to small wooden mugs that were often used to serve this type of drink. Others propose a similar story but explain that the ""nog"" comes the Norfolk slang nog to refer to the strong ales that were often served in these cups. Still others think the name is a contraction of colonial Americans' request to bartenders for an ""egg-and-grog"" when they wanted a glass. Furthermore, while the drink itself may date back to medieval times, the word ""eggnog"" is a relatively recent invention. The first recorded instances of the use of ""eggnog"" only date back to the late 18th century, and by that time, bartenders in the young United States had already tweaked the recipe to give it a more American twist. The Madeira and sherry that English aristocrats had used for their version of eggnog were scarce on this side of the pond, but we had plenty of rum and whiskey. In 1800, author Isaac Weld, Jr. described the American recipe for eggnog as consisting of ""new milk, eggs, rum, and sugar, beat up together."" Mental Floss: The pooping log and other colorful holiday characters . Have one for George Washington . Yes, early Americans loved their eggnog, and you can use this fact to your advantage if you down a few too many glasses this year. Simply point out that you're in good company with the likes of George Washington. Kitchen records from Mount Vernon indicate that Washington served an eggnog-like drink to visitors, and since the general wasn't strapped for cash, he didn't skimp on the sauce. Washington's potent recipe included three different types of booze: rye whiskey, rum, and sherry. Nobody could tell a lie after having a few cups of that. Not everyone had Washington's funds, though. A thorough look at historical recipes reveals that for most tipplers, the type of booze they snuck into their nog didn't really matter as long as there was something to give it a little kick. In addition to rum, ale, whiskey, and wines, an 1879 collection of recipes from Virginia housewives features a recipe that calls for 12 eggs, eight wine-glassfuls of brandy, and four wine-glassfuls of wine. Another calls for three dozen eggs, half a gallon of domestic brandy, and another half-pint of French brandy. Something's telling us these shindigs got a little wild. You might not want to read the label . If you pick up a carton of commercial eggnog at the supermarket, you're probably getting much more nog than egg. FDA regulations only require that 1.0 percent of a product's final weight be made up of egg yolk solids for it to bear the eggnog name. For ""eggnog flavored milk,"" the bar is even lower; in addition to requiring less butterfat in the recipe, this label only requires 0.5 percent egg yolk solids in the carton. Of course, there are other good reasons why we don't tip back eggnog year-round. Sure, nobody's reaching for a nice cup of something custardy on a hot day, but it's not very good for you at all. A relatively small four-ounce cup of store-bought eggnog boasts a whopping 170 calories (half of them from fat), nearly 10 grams of fat, and over 70 mg of cholesterol. (If you're keeping score at home, that's around a quarter of your recommended daily intake of cholesterol.) If you choose to eschew these commercial brands in favor of mixing up your own eggnog, you'll probably want to use pasteurized eggs to suppress the risk of a nasty case of salmonella; not even a playlist featuring ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"" ruins a holiday party quite as quickly as making everyone in attendance violently ill. Don't use unpasteurized eggs under the old argument of ""the booze will kill the germs,"" either. The FDA advises that this strategy isn't likely to work. Mental Floss: The history of Christmas tree lights . An unhealthy obsession . Nutritional info aside, eggnog still has a strong following among holiday drinkers. It's hard to top the devotion shared by a Virginia father and son in the late 19th century, though. In 1900, Good Housekeeping ran a story about the Christmas-morning eggnog traditions of Virginia, and it included this anecdote: . ""So religiously is this custom of the eggnog drinking observed that Judge Garnett of Mathews County tells a story of rushing in on Christmas morning to warn his father that the house was on fire. The old gentleman first led his son to the breakfast table and ladled out his glass of eggnog, drank one with him, then went to care for the burning building."" True or not, the story certainly underscores the downright magical powers of eggnog. Nobody's braving a burning building to have a cup of fruit punch or spiced cider.

The vehicle was shipped from Shanghai to the Jack Barclay showroom in Mayfair, west London, after being showcased at events around the world. To give it a 'shake down' ahead of sale, they brought in Topaz Detailing to give its carbon fibre and polished aluminium body new finish. Experts spent more than eight hours forensically examining the car with a microscope to pinpoint even the tiniest imperfection. Using an ultrasonic depth measurement gauge, they assessed the depth of each layer of the vehicle’s paint, which is made up of primer, paint and lacquer. After studying the scans on a laptop, they then remove the scratches and impurities in a process known as paint correction, using electronic buffing tools. Using the finest grades of polish, they scanned and polished until all of the scratches and impurities in that section were removed before moving on to the next part.

 KILLEEN, Tex. — The Army specialist at Fort Hood who killed three and wounded 16 of his fellow soldiers on Wednesday had an angry dispute over a leave request shortly before the shooting rampage, a law enforcement official said Friday. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 After a meeting where he had sought a leave to attend to family matters, he was clearly agitated and disrespectful when his request was denied, said the official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the investigation. 
  
 Fort Hood officials and a spokesman for Army investigators declined to comment on Friday about the meeting and its role in the shooting, but they confirmed in an afternoon news conference that the specialist, Ivan Lopez, became angry with soldiers from his unit before the attack. Two of those he killed were in his unit, a transportation battalion of the 13th Sustainment Command. Officials stressed that they had still not established a clear motive. 
  
 But in an interview with a local Mississippi television station, Theodis Westbrook, of Smithdale, Miss., the father of Sgt. Jonathan Westbrook, who was wounded in the attack, said he was told that a soldier came to Fort Hood’s personnel office, where Sergeant Westbrook worked, to get a leave form. When one of the soldiers told the man to come back the next day to pick that form up, the man left, then returned with a gun and opened fire.

 “The first guy he shot right in front of my son was killed, and then he turned the gun towards Jonathan, aimed it, and fired,” Mr. Westbrook said. “I don’t know how many times he fired, but he hit my son four times.” 
  
 The Army has said that Specialist Lopez, who ended his rampage by fatally shooting himself, had been undergoing evaluation for post-traumatic stress disorder and treatment for depression and anxiety. But the post commander, Lt. Gen. Mark A. Milley, said on Friday that his “underlying medical conditions” were not a direct factor in the shootings. 
  
 “We believe that the immediate precipitating factor was more likely an escalating argument in his unit area,” General Milley said.

 On his Facebook page, Specialist Lopez expressed a variety of concerns — including outrage at Adam Lanza’s shooting rampage in Newtown, Conn., the fear he felt in a convoy in Iraq and, more recently, anger with Army bureaucracy. He arrived on base in February after being transferred from Fort Bliss in El Paso. It was unclear how his writing might help explain his increasingly troubled state of mind. 
  
 “Given that the alleged shooter is deceased, the possibility does exist that we may never know exactly why the alleged shooter did what he did,” said Chris Grey, a spokesman for the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command in Quantico, Va., the lead agency investigating the shooting. 
  
 Specialist Lopez’s father released a written statement, in Spanish, on Friday in which he suggested that mental illness must have played a role in his son’s actions. “My son could not have been in his right mind,” said Ivan Lopez, the father. “This is not who he was.”

 The statement, released in Guayanilla, P.R., where Specialist Lopez grew up and where his family still lives, said that the deaths of his mother and grandfather, along with “the recent changes he experienced in his transfer to the base affected his condition as a result of his experiences as a soldier.” He was divorced from his first wife, who also lives in Puerto Rico with their two children. His second wife and a child lived with him in Texas. 
  
 The troubled Facebook posts and comments Specialist Lopez made in the last two years — which are only visible to his friends on the site — appeared as posts from “Ivan Slipknot,” his Facebook identity and a reference to a favorite heavy metal band, friends said. 
  
 On March 1, the same day he purchased the .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol he used in the attack, Specialist Lopez wrote an especially angry and vaguely threatening post. “My spiritual peace has all gone away, I am full of hate, I believe now the devil is taking me. I was robbed last night and I’m sure it was two flacos. Green light and thumbs down. It’s just that easy ...”

 The post was unclear about whether he was referring to an actual robbery, or a figurative robbery in which he was, perhaps, denied something that he felt was owed to him. The term “flacos” literally means thin people, but it is often used in a derogatory fashion to describe those who are too thin, implying that they are drug addicts. However, it is sometimes used to address another man, much as an English-speaking American might call a friend “dude.” 
  
 On Feb. 27, he posted a photo of what appeared to be a handgun with the comment “Plaka, plaka, plaka, plaka...,” Puerto Rican slang that means “Bang, bang, bang, bang...” 
  
 His posts in November showed him struggling with the death of his mother, Carmen Lopez, a nurse in Guayanilla who died that month, and grappling with problems with the Army at the time of his mother’s death.

 “In shock. Mom died today,” he wrote on Nov. 15. “Thanks for your condolences. I couldn’t answer your calls,” he wrote, blaming Army bureaucracy, which he described with a vulgarity. 
  
 One law enforcement official said Specialist Lopez had told others that he should have received more time off after his mother’s death. It was apparently a source of anger for him, the official said. “He felt like he wasn’t being treated fairly,” the official said. “He wasn’t getting what he felt he should have been entitled to.” 
  
 On Facebook, he made other posts that appeared noteworthy in light of the shooting. On Oct. 3, he wrote in English, without further explanation: “Looking for a target.” 
  
 On Dec. 9, he wrote of his tour of duty in Iraq: “Exact 1 year and 2 days ago, I went out of Iraq having seen, in Falluja, the most brutal explosion at about 1,200 meters.” He described what happened, writing that moments after he turned on the ignition of his vehicle, he saw the mushroom cloud of a large blast not far away. “I was only trying to concentrate on breathing deeply and keeping the focus I needed to finish the mission. There were hours of agony waiting for an attack by insurgents, but we were able to come out of Falluja alive. I was in vehicle #6. The worst part was that vehicle #5 was a diesel truck, the perfect target. And I only thought of seeing my family again.”

 General Milley stressed that Specialist Lopez appeared not to have experienced direct combat while in Iraq and that he was being evaluated for, but had not received a diagnosis of, post-traumatic stress disorder. “So far, we have not discovered any specific traumatic event, wounds received in action, contact with the enemy, or anything else specific that he may have been exposed to while deployed,” the general said. 
  
 Of the 16 people wounded on Wednesday, 10 have been treated and released. Three remained at Scott & White Memorial Hospital in Temple, and three others were recovering at the Fort Hood medical center. Army officials identified the three soldiers killed in the attack, for whom they planned on holding a memorial service next week: Sgt. First Class Daniel Michael Ferguson, 39, of Mulberry, Fla.; Staff Sgt. Carlos A. Lazaney-Rodriguez, 38, of Aguadilla, P.R.; and Sgt. Timothy Wayne Owens, 37, of Effingham, Ill. 
  
 The first report of the shooting came in at 4:16 p.m. Wednesday, when two soldiers who were wounded made the first call to 911. Officials said the shooting spanned a matter of only minutes over an area encompassing two city blocks, unfolding both inside buildings and outdoors in and near the First Medical Brigade area. Specialist Lopez was mobile at one point, shooting at soldiers as he drove in his vehicle from one location to another. 
  
 He then approached a military police sergeant who responded to the 911 call. There was a verbal exchange between them, and then the sergeant drew her weapon and fired a round when Specialist Lopez brandished his weapon. He then placed his gun to his head and fired, killing himself, officials said. ||||| FORT HOOD, Texas (AP) — The Fort Hood soldier who gunned down three other military men before killing himself had an argument with soldiers in his unit before opening fire, and investigators believe his mental condition was not the ""direct precipitating factor"" in the shooting, authorities said Friday.

 The base's commander, Lt. Gen. Mark Milley, made the remarks about Spc. Ivan Lopez's health a day after officials said his mental condition appeared to be an underlying factor in the attack. 
  
 On Friday, Milley said that an ""escalating argument"" precipitated the assault. 
  
 Also Friday, Lopez's father said his son had struggled with the recent deaths of his mother and grandfather and the stress of being transferred to a new base. 
  
 Lopez's father, who shares the same name, said his son was receiving medical treatment but was a peaceful family man and a hard worker. 
  
 ""This is very painful for me,"" the elder Lopez said in the statement from his native Puerto Rico, calling for prayers for the dead and the 16 people who were wounded in the shooting rampage. ""My son could not have been in his right mind. He was not like that."" 
  
 Wednesday's attack was the second at the base since 2009, when 13 people were killed by Army psychiatrist Nidal Hasan, who had said he was angry about being deployed to Afghanistan. 
  
 Lopez, an Army truck driver, did a short stint in Iraq in 2011 and told medical personnel he had suffered a traumatic brain injury. The 34-year-old was undergoing treatment for depression and anxiety while being evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder, base officials said. 
  
 But officials said Lopez did not see any combat in Iraq, and had not previously demonstrated a risk of violence. 
  
 He seemed to have a clean record that showed no ties to potential terrorists, though military officials said the investigation was ongoing. 
  
 A family spokesman said Thursday that Lopez was upset he was granted only a 24-hour leave to attend his mother's funeral in November. That leave was then extended to two days. 
  
 Three people who were critically injured in the attack improved to fair condition Friday at Scott & White Memorial Hospital in Temple. A fourth victim was expected to be released later in the day. At the military's request, the hospital said, it would not make the wounded or their families available for media interviews. 
  
 Also Friday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Ted Cruz visited wounded at a military hospital. Cruz said he was inspired by a soldier who had suffered a bullet wound to his abdomen, but still shielded other soldiers and called 911. 
  
 Investigators searched Lopez's home on Thursday and questioned his wife, who declined to comment in Spanish when reached by phone by The Associated Press. 
  
 Lopez walked into a base building around 4 p.m. Wednesday and began firing a .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol. He then got into a vehicle and continued shooting before entering another building on the Army post. He eventually was confronted by military police in a parking lot, Milley said. 
  
 As he came within 20 feet of a police officer, the gunman put his hands up but then reached under his jacket and pulled out his gun. The officer drew her own weapon, and the suspect put his gun to his head and pulled the trigger a final time, Milley said.

 Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico. ||||| FORT HOOD, Texas (AP) — The three soldiers killed in a shooting rampage at Fort Hood by another military man had served in the military for years and been deployed to Iraq as well as other places. 
  
 Lt. Gen. Mark Milley on Friday identified those killed as 39-year-old Daniel Ferguson, of Mulberry, Fla.; 38-year-old Carlos Lazaney Rodriguez, of Puerto Rico; and 37-year-old Timothy Owens, of Effingham, Ill. 
  
 Milley says Spc. Ivan Lopez killed the three Wednesday at the military base after a verbal altercation that escalated. He then killed himself. 
  
 Ferguson was a transportation supervisor who had been deployed to Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan. 
  
 Lazaney Rodriguez was a unit supply sergeant who had served in Kuwait and Iraq. 
  
 Owens was a heavy vehicle driver who had also been deployed in Iraq and Kuwait. ||||| Story highlights An ""escalating argument"" may have led to shooting, officials say 
  
 Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Ted Cruz visit some shooting victims 
  
 Gunman Ivan Lopez killed three people, wounded 16 others at the Army post 
  
 A memorial for three soldiers killed will be held at Fort Hood next Wednesday 
  
 Authorities investigating this week's deadly shooting spree at Fort Hood said Friday that an altercation between Spc. Ivan Lopez and his fellow soldiers, rather than a medical condition, may have led to Lopez opening fire. 
  
 ""The immediate precipitating factor was more likely an escalating argument in his unit area,"" Lt. Gen. Mark Milley, the post's commanding general, told reporters. 
  
 Some of the soldiers involved in the altercation were victims in the shooting, according to Chris Grey, spokesman for the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, who appeared with Milley at a news conference on the sprawling post. 
  
 Officials would not release further details about the argument, saying the investigation was still ongoing into what caused the 34-year-old to set out on a shooting spree that left three soldiers dead and 16 wounded before he killed himself. 
  
 But the sister of one of the soldiers injured in the attack said that prior to the shooting Lopez stopped by the base's personnel office to pick up a form requesting leave -- or military permission to be away for a time. 
  
 Armetra Otis, sister of Sgt. Jonathan Westbrook, said on CNN's ""The Lead"" that her brother ""was at work and a guy came in and asked for a leave form."" 
  
 The soldier was told he would have to come back later, Otis said, 
  
 ""And apparently I guess he didn't want to hear that, so he came back and just opened fire, "" Otis said. 
  
 ""He shot the first guy he saw and killed him and then turned the gun on my brother and he was shot four times,"" she said. Sgt. Westbrook was released from a hospital Friday, his sister said.

 Both Milley and Grey said they did not know if the leave issue in itself led to the altercation. 
  
 ""At this time, we have not established a concrete motive,"" Grey said. 
  
 Investigators have not uncovered any history of criminal convictions or previous criminal activity by Lopez, nor have they found any links to terrorism. 
  
 On Thursday Milley said investigators believed a medical history that indicates an unstable psychiatric or psychological condition may be a ""fundamental causal factor,"" in the shooting. 
  
 But on Friday he said investigators ""do not believe"" that his ""underlying medical conditions ... are the direct precipitating factor"" 
  
 The shooting blindsided victims, said Dr. Matthew Davis, medical director of trauma services at Scott & White Memorial Hospital in Temple. 
  
 ""It was a shocking episode. It felt very surreal,"" he said after speaking to victims. ""It was a very unexpected thing in the middle of a working day."" 
  
 Governor, senator visit 
  
 Texas Gov. Rick Perry and the state's junior U.S. senator visited with some of the wounded Friday. 
  
 Speaking to reporters at Fort Hood afterward, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz hailed the bravery of wounded survivors. He recalled the story of one soldier, shot in the abdomen, who called 911 and ""stepped forward"" to save others. 
  
 Acknowledging the post has seen two mass shootings since 2009, Perry said there were no easy answers to what happened Wednesday, but that soldiers there will ""recover from this latest tragedy."" 
  
 ""We'll learn lessons about what occurred here and minimize the chances of this ever happening again,"" Perry said. 
  
 Perry and Cruz declined to answer questions about whether soldiers should be able to carry concealed weapons on base. Right now, Perry said, the focus should be on those who were wounded or killed Wednesday. 
  
 The conditions of three victims, who were previously listed as critical, have been upgraded to fair, Scott & White Memorial Hospital posted on Twitter on Friday morning. 
  
 Five have been discharged from the hospital. Of the four remaining Friday morning, one was expected to go home later in the day, the hospital said. 
  
 Milley announced Friday afternoon that the three soldiers killed will be remembered in a memorial service at the post next Wednesday, exactly one week after the attack. 
  
 The rampage 
  
 The shooting started about 4 p.m. Wednesday when Lopez walked into an administration building at the base and opened fire with his .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol.

 He then got into a car, fired from the vehicle, got out of the car, walked into another nearby administration building and fired again. 
  
 One of the locations was the medical brigade, the other the transportation battalion. Lopez was assigned to the 13th Sustainment Command, which deals with logistics. In his work, he had regular dealings with the transportation battalion. 
  
 But authorities have ""no indication at this time"" that Lopez was targeting specific soldiers when he opened fire on the Army post, Milley said. 
  
 The base, which has more than 45,000 soldiers and nearly 9,000 civilian employees, went on lockdown after the shooting began. 
  
 A short time later, a military police officer came face to face with Lopez. Both he and she drew their weapons, Milley said. 
  
 Lopez put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger, ending his life. 
  
 At Lopez's apartment, his wife was watching news reports about the spree, worrying about her husband, from whom she had not heard all afternoon, said neighbor Xanderia Morris, who tried to console her. 
  
 But Lopez's wife had no idea that he was the shooter until a local TV station identified the dead gunman. His widow became ""hysterical"" when she heard the news, Morris said. 
  
 Officers picked up Lopez's widow at their apartment near the base in Killeen, and she was cooperating with law enforcement, an FBI official told CNN. 
  
 Depression, anxiety 
  
 Lopez hailed from Puerto Rico, where he served in the National Guard from 1999 until 2010 before moving to the U.S. Army. 
  
 He had two deployments as an infantryman, including a four-month stint in Iraq in 2011 as a truck driver, Milley said. 
  
 Before coming to Fort Hood in February, Lopez served at Fort Bliss in Texas. 
  
 He, his wife and their daughter moved into an apartment a little more than a week before the shooting. 
  
 They appeared to be a normal couple, smiling ""whenever they'd see someone,"" Morris said. 
  
 But behind Lopez's smile lay a history of depression, anxiety and other psychiatric disorders, Milley told reporters. The soldier was receiving treatment and taking antidepressants, he said. 
  
 Army records don't show him as having been wounded in Iraq, but Lopez reported that he had suffered a traumatic brain injury, Milley said. 
  
 The shooter ""had a clean record"" behaviorally, Army Secretary John McHugh said. And he gave no sign during a psychiatric exam last month that he was likely to become violent. 
  
 Lopez had also been prescribed the sedative Ambien, McHugh said. 
  
 Investigators who searched his home have found no significant physical evidence, such as a suicide note, to indicate motive, a law enforcement official told CNN on Friday on the condition of anonymity. 
  
 The official also said that Lopez purchased a ""large amount"" of ammunition when he bought a .45-caliber gun on March 1, and continued to buy more ammunition throughout March. 
  
 U.S. law enforcement officials previously said Lopez bought his gun at Guns Galore, a store in Killeen. 
  
 The casualties 
  
 All those killed in the shooting were military personnel, Milley said. 
  
 Sgt. Timothy Owens was one them, his family said in a prepared statement. 
  
 ""He was a very outgoing person and enjoyed Taekwondo,"" the statement said. ""He loved his job in the Army and was going to make it a career."" 
  
 Owens, 37, was a counselor in the Army and had served in Iraq. 
  
 His mother, Mary Muntean, told CNN affiliate WICS-TV in Springfield, Illinois: ""He was a good person. Why would they shoot a good person that was helping them?"" Owens loved the military and planned to make it his career, his mother told the station. 
  
 ""He didn't answer the phone so I left a message on his phone: 'Son, call me so I know if you're OK or not.' Well, never got no call from him. I thought: 'Oh God, please don't let it be,'"" his mother said. 
  
 Also killed was Staff Sgt. Carlos A. Lazaney-Rodriguez of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, according to his aunt, Benny Rodriguez. 
  
 Lazaney-Rodriguez, 38, planned to retire from the military soon after serving 20 years, Aguadilla Mayor Carlos Mendez told CNN en Español's Mayra Cuevas. 
  
 ""It was a very close-knit family,"" Mendez said ""Excellent, decent, very good people. I know his family and his parents. They are good people."" 
  
 Sgt. 1st Class Danny Ferguson also was killed, his fiancée, Kristen Haley, told CNN affiliate WTSP-TV in Tampa, Florida. 
  
 Ferguson died trying to hold a door shut to stop the shooter, Haley, also a soldier, told CNN affiliate WTSP-TV in Tampa, Florida. 
  
 ""He held that door shut because it wouldn't lock. It seems the doors would be bullet proof, but apparently they're not,"" Haley told the station. ""If he wasn't the one standing there holding those doors closed, that shooter would have been able to get through and shoot everyone else."" 
  
 Haley said Ferguson was a native of Mulberry, Florida, and an outstanding athlete at Mulberry High, where he graduated in 1993. The small town is about 30 miles east of Tampa. 
  
 One or two wounded victims may face long-term disabilities, but doctors are working to prevent this, said Davis, the Scott & White Memorial Hospital medical director of trauma services. 
  
 Not again 
  
 When he first heard about the shooting, Davis says one thought ran through his mind: ""How can this possibly happen again?"" 
  
 Less than five years ago, the hospital where Davis works treated casualties after Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan killed 13 people and wounded 32 more in a November 2009 shooting at Fort Hood. 
  
 Hasan was convicted of 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder, and a military jury recommended in August that he be put to death. 
  
 The former military psychiatrist told a court he was on a terrorist mission to protect leading members of the Taliban.

Investigators are backing up early reports that Lopez had an argument with one or more soldiers immediately prior to the assault, reports AP. And while Lopez's mental health issues may have played a role, it was the argument that set him off, said Lt. Gen. Mark Milley, reports the Washington Post. “His underlying medical conditions are not a direct precipitating factor,” said Milley. “We believe that the immediate precipitating factor was more likely an escalating argument in his unit area.” A CNN report adds further credence to the belief that the argument was about Lopez's request for a leave of absence. The father of wounded soldier Jonathan Westbrook says his son was working in the office that distributes leave forms when Lopez came in and was told by an officer to return the following day. Instead, he returned a short time later and opened fire, says Theodis Westbrook. ""The first guy he shot right in front of my son was killed, and then he turned the gun towards Jonathan, aimed it, and fired,"" the elder Westbrook tells WLBT of Mississippi. ""I don't know how many times he fired, but he hit my son four times."" (Earlier, the New York Times had a similar report, though it said that Lopez's leave had been denied, and that he became angry while discussing it with Fort Hood officials.) The Pentagon, meanwhile, has confirmed that the three soldiers killed were Daniel Ferguson, 39, of Mulberry, Fla.; Carlos Lazaney Rodriguez, 38, of Puerto Rico; and Timothy Owens, 37, of Effingham, Ill. Ferguson was a transportation supervisor, Lazaney Rodriguez a unit supply sergeant, and Owens a heavy vehicle driver. All had served time overseas."

"The report by the High Fliers market research company found that about 1,000 graduates turned down job offers at the last minute, leaving employers searching for replacements in 2015.
Around 20,000 students were recruited, mostly at the start of their last year.
This means students have time to change their plans if better options emerge.
Martin Birchall, High Fliers managing director, said: ""At the very top end of the market, employers are fighting it out over the same few candidates - those who are expected to do well, with the best CVs and who have developed their skills at university.
""It's not unusual for the top employers to tell us that more and more of these graduates are receiving five or six offers.""
He added: ""It's very welcome news that Britain's top employers are recruiting their biggest-ever intake of new graduates in 2016.
""But as the job market goes from strength to strength, it's clear that our brightest graduates are becoming increasingly choosy about the employers they join.""
The number of graduates hired rose 3.3% in 2015 with their starting salary at the UK's leading employers remaining at about Â£30,000 for the second year running.
However, graduate pay at the top law firms, investment banks and accounting firms increased further.
Other findings included:","The UK's leading employers are ""fighting it out"" for a handful of top candidates, as the graduate jobs market continues to improve, a report says."
"GOODLETTSVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) – Goodlettsville police say a woman shot her ex-boyfriend after he was allegedly found hiding under a bed at her home Tuesday afternoon. 
  
 It happened just before 3 p.m. in the 200 block of Shevel Drive. 
  
 According to police, the man entered the home, which was having an alarm system installed, while she went to a neighbor’s home for a few minutes. 
  
 “She was warning me about her ex-boyfriend and not to let him around me or my home,” a neighbor told News 2. 
  
 Police told News 2 the homeowner shot the man in self-defense and will likely not face charges. 
  
 Police said the woman had a restraining order against him and that he had three outstanding violations against that order. He will be charged on those outstanding warrants and more charges are pending. 
  
 “Good for her!” neighbor Mary Alice Lovell said. She told News 2 she has seen police cars over the victim’s residence before. 
  
 “In this case, if he was trying to abuse her and she had a gun and she had a restraining order against him, then she has to protect herself,” Lovell said. 
  
 The man, whose identity has not been released, suffered non-life threatening injuries. 
  
 News 2 spoke with the victim briefly over the phone. 
  
 She said she said when she saw her ex-boyfriend under the bed; she knew it was either her or him. ||||| A Nashville woman having a security system installed to protect against a man who threatened her life and was stalking her actually found the man hiding under her bed as the security system was being installed.

 GOODLETTSVILLE, Tenn.--A woman having a security system installed to protect against a man who threatened her life and was stalking her actually found the man hiding under her bed as the security system was being installed. 
  
 First reported on FOX 17 Tuesday, Metro Police affidavits now paint a clearer picture of the events leading up to the self-defense shooting. According to the report, 52-year-old Tony Joe Gunter and the woman had dated for two years when earlier this month she found out about his ""extensive criminal history."" The woman broke up with Gunter and instructed him not to return when he allegedly stated ""I will kill you, you stupid c***."" 
  
 Since that day, the woman says she has changed her locks twice and had three different occasions where she came home and found signs Gunter had broken in and was there. She also filed an order of protection against Gunter.

 The woman called ADT security to have a system installed on Tuesday and says she was on her cell phone and computer as the ADT rep was installing the system. She says after the installer completed the job, she went to her room to check the connection to her cell phone but her phone was missing. That is when she noticed Gunter's feet under her bed. 
  
 The woman told the ADT installer to call 911 and pulled a gun, shooting Gunter in the left foot as he was under her bed. She says she instructed Gunter to give back the phone and he threw it out from under the bed. She held Gunter at gunpoint until police arrived. 
  
 Gunter admitted to police he entered the home and hid under the bed, taking the phone to keep the woman from calling police. 
  
 The 52-year-old is facing charges of Aggravated Burglary, Stalking, Violating and Order of Protection and Theft. ||||| A Tennessee woman who found her stalker ex-boyfriend hiding under her bed shot him in the foot and held him until his arrest Tuesday, police said. 
  
 Tony Joe Gunter, 52, violated the woman’s order of protection against him by sneaking into her Nashville-area home while she was having a security system installed around 3 p.m., according to a Goodlettsville police affidavit cited by WZTV. 
  
 The woman had ended her relationship of two years with Gunter earlier this month after finding out about his criminal history, according to investigators. He vowed, “I will kill you, you stupid c--t,�? when she told him to go and never come back, the affidavit showed. 
  
 The woman filed for the order of protection after she said Gunter broke into her Shevel Drive home three different times, according to police. She had changed her locks twice, and she hired ADT to install a home security system Tuesday.

 Investigators said she was looking for her phone in her room when she noticed Gunter’s feet under her bed. She shot him in the left foot and asked the ADT staff member who worked on her system to dial 911, according to police. 
  
 The woman then held Gunter at gunpoint until police arrived to the home, the affidavit showed. He later told investigators he had grabbed the woman’s phone so that she wouldn’t be able to call the police. 
  
 Gunter faces two felony charges of aggravated burglary and property theft, four misdemeanor charges of order of protection violations and a misdemeanor stalking charge, Davidson County inmate records showed.

 Authorities revoked Gunter's driver's license in 2014 after prior convictions of driving with a suspended license and a fourth-time offense of driving under the influence. He was incarcerated on a $165,000 bond after receiving treatment at a hospital Tuesday.

 The woman, who was not identified, told WKRN she knew it was her or him when she saw Gunter’s feet in his hiding place. Her neighbor Mary Alice Lovell said she is happy the stalking victim had managed to catch and shoot Gunter. 
  
 “Good for her,�? Lovell told the TV station while standing in her doorway in the city 13 miles northeast of downtown Nashville. 
  
 “They’ve had violence over there before. I can’t blame her for that,�? Lovell said. “In this case, if he was trying to abuse her and she had a gun and she had a restraining order against him, then she has to protect herself.�? |||||","– A Tennessee woman had a restraining order against her ex-boyfriend and had changed her locks twice. She says neither kept Tony Joe Gunter away and so she opted to have a security system installed. Authorities say the woman left her home in Goodlettsville briefly on Tuesday to visit a neighbor as an ADT worker was installing the alarm and returned to find her phone inexplicably missing from her bedroom. Then she noticed a pair of feet sticking out from under her bed—Gunter's. Fearing for her life, the woman shot him in his left foot then kept him there as the installer called police, authorities tell WZTV. After a hospital visit, Gunter, 52, was arrested and charged with aggravated burglary, stalking, and other charges, reports the New York Daily News. Police say the woman won't be charged because she acted in self defense. ""If he was trying to abuse her and she had a gun and she had a restraining order against him, then she has to protect herself,"" a neighbor tells WKRN. The pair reportedly dated for two years before the woman discovered Gunter's ""extensive criminal history"" and broke off the relationship this month, per WZTV. Gunter then threatened to kill his ex, according to police. She filed a restraining order but police say the woman discovered signs that Gunter had broken into her home three times before the encounter Tuesday. Gunter—who police say admitted to taking the woman's phone so she couldn't call police—is being held on $165,000 bond. (Police say a man hid under his ex's bed for days.)"
"(CNN) -- A jihadist website is urging its American followers to kill comedian David Letterman, saying his tongue deserves to be cut over his remarks about a terror leader, an online intelligence group said. The writer posted the death threat after he got upset by a Letterman joke about an al Qaeda leader killed in Pakistan, according to SITE intelligence group, which monitors and translates online terror activity. Ilyas Kashmiri, described as al Qaeda's ""military brain,"" died in a drone strike in June, his jihadist group said at the time. Letterman cracked jokes about the killing, and dragged his finger across his neck to show ""the way of the slaughter,""  the message on the jihadist site said. He then said Kashmiri joins terror leader Osama bin Laden, who was killed in Pakistan in May, according to the message posted Wednesday. ""This despicable person mocked the leaders of the mujahideen,"" the post says. The death threat urges jihadist followers to cut off Letterman's tongue and ""shut it forever."" CNN could not independently confirm the message. A spokesman for the FBI said the agency is looking into the death threats. ""In the post 9/11 world, we take all of these threats seriously,"" spokesman Peter Donald said. A federal law enforcement official said such threats are common. ""We see these kinds of threats frequently against people in business and media. Usually nothing comes of them, but we check them all out,"" the official said. CBS's publicity department for ""Late Show With David Letterman"" declined to comment Thursday on the issue. But on the show's official Facebook page, the comedian's fans rallied to his defense. ""Keep doing what you do Dave,"" wrote Ronnie W., one of Letterman's supporters. ""Dont let Al Quaeda influence your comedy, but Inspire it .... we got your back."" Steve Grand, director of the Brookings Institution's U.S. Relations with the Islamic World project, said that jihadists closely track U.S. culture -- as seen in seized videos showing the late Osama bin Laden watching western news programs. He said there's a sense U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, a prominent member in al Qaeda, may be looking to ""find ways of entering the American discourse."" ""There's an obsession with the United States and the West, more generally,"" said Grand. ""And there is a desire to defend their cause through violence."" The internet serves as a motivational resource for jihadists used ""to inspire offshoots and to encourage like-minded people,"" the Brookings' fellow added. As such, a specific threat -- like the one targeting Letterman -- could be viewed as encouraging others to act. Yet Grand, like the federal law enforcement official, notes that dozens of such threats are made monthly. What may be more significant is how the American public reacts. ""(U.S. citizens) have gotten use to this kind of talk, and there's sort of a resilience,"" he said. ""What is most invaluable in the United States is that the best tool against terrorism is resilience, ... to not be cowed by threats and get back to your lives."" CNN's Carol Cratty, Karen Bonsignore and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: Letterman's fans support him online, with one saying, ""Keep doing what you do Dave""

A woman charged with defacing the Washington National Cathedral has been ordered to a halfway house. Jiamei Tian, 58, appeared at a preliminary hearing in D.C. Superior Court today, where a judge ordered that she wear an ankle monitoring bracelet and barred her from leaving the halfway house or having visitors.

Clean-up: A worker cleans green paint from the organ in the Bethlehem Chapel at the National Cathedral on Monday. The Chinese woman was arrested at the scene with a soda can containing green paint . Vandal: The woman appeared in D.C. Superior Court on alongside a Mandarin translator . Police and prosecutors also believe . she's connected to several acts of similar vandalism, including at the . Lincoln Memorial, a church and at a Smithsonian statue. Authorities . haven't revealed a motive. They say Tian has a Chinese passport and . that she was traveling in Washington on an expired visa. In another church near Thomas Circle, Tian allegedly splashed the organ with a mixture of white paint, feces and urine. D.C. police Chief Cathy L. Lanier told NewsChannel8 on Tuesday that the paint incidents are likely to be connected and that the woman may have 'mental health issues.' Authorities also said that Tian appears to speak very little English and her motives remain unclear. Green paint was discovered splattered onto the Lincoln Memorial early last Friday morning, and it was found later on a statue outside the Smithsonian headquarters on the National Mall, as reported by Wusa9.com. Target: The highly-popular Lincoln Memorial was splashed with paint . Gentle work: The green paint is carefully removed from the organ in the Washington National Cathedral's historic Bethlehem Chapel on Tuesday . Police said she had no fixed address but that she told officers she lived in Los Angeles. Following her arrest, a witness contacted police and reported that the woman had been seen attending a service at a church less than a block from Thomas Circle, according to court documents. The witness reported that the woman was carrying three bags with her. After she left, the witness found that a pipe organ in the church had been splattered with white paint, urine and feces, documents show.

D.C. police said paint from the cathedral would likely be sent to the FBI for testing. Bethlehem Chapel was opened in 1912 and is the oldest section of the cathedral. It was the site of President Woodrow Wilson's burial rites, and his remains were entombed there for more than three decades. Wilson's remains were later interred in a memorial bay on the cathedral's main level.","Jia M.

"At a prep school in Kent, during High Tea, a master asks his pupils if anyone would like to do ballet. In a sea of waving girls’ paws, only one little boy’s hand shoots up. Mine. And then, with howl of the other children’s laughter echoing in my ears, I realised: boys don’t do ballet. So I bottled out, and I have always regretted it. Called to the Barre: Richard Dennen is put through his paces in his BarreCorre class by owner Niki Rein . Today, male ballet dancers are the new rock stars. The Adonis-like Brazilian Carlos Acosta is a household name and Sergei Polunin, a 23-year-old tattooed Russian wild child, made headlines when he sensationally quit as principal of the Royal Ballet last year. Now, apparently, rock stars are doing ballet. Mick Jagger, a sprightly 69 and preparing to headline the Glastonbury Festival with The Rolling Stones next weekend, has revealed how he credited his remarkable fitness to ballet. Then I heard about the ballet-based workout class at Barrecore studio on Kings Road, Chelsea, run by fitness guru Niki Rein. She is rumoured to be behind Princess Beatrice’s new figure and I was intrigued to find out what you have to go through to get a ballet body... NOT JUST FOR GIRLS . The . class is actually a hybrid of Pilates and ballet, incorporating cardio, . light weights and various stretching and balancing poses, all to music. Moves like me: Mick Jagger, 69, takes regular ballet classes to keep physically fit . It’s most certainly not just for girls. ‘Half of the guys who come can’t finish their first class,’ says Niki. ‘We work on legs and the lower half of the body, which men aren’t used to. 'Men are stronger in the upper body so they power through press-ups. But then they stand at the barre and after the first set of thighs their legs are all over the place, the eyes glaze over .  .  . they start to get dizzy.’ I thought I was going to die after my first class, but I could quickly see why it’s becoming a cult hit. A number of gyms have started offering ballet-style workouts, and Britain’s biggest, Virgin Active, is looking at rolling it out nationwide. There is genuine sports science behind it. Gillian Reeves, national group exercise manager for Virgin Active, explains: ‘Ballet improves posture, balance and co-ordination. 'The exercises all promote muscular strength and endurance but won’t bulk the body, helping to give that lean, dancer physique. For the greatest benefits, a healthy diet is needed also.’ A PERKIER BOTTOM . Niki promises longer, leaner limbs and the pert bottom of a dancer. ‘Ballet makes you leaner, and stand taller. 'There is a focus on the back of the body and if the back is strong, then it makes the shoulders look broader, you carry yourself taller, and the waist looks smaller.’ Niki arrived in London in 2009 after working with dance-cardio celebrity trainer Tracey Anderson and celebrities including Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow. She started a private barre class in a client’s mews house and, when 25 ladies turned up, quickly realised that London needed her. THIGHS FEEL THE BURN . The class, for normally no more than ten to 15 people, lasts an hour and takes place in a dance studio with a mirrored wall and a long rail – the barre – that runs the length of the room, just above my waist height. Ideal Adonis: Ballet rockstar Carlos Acosta is an fitness inspiration for men across the globe . After a warm-up, there are press-ups and planks (where you hold the extended press-up position until your middle is shaking with the strain) .  .  . and then the real workout starts. There are various ballet-inspired positions: holding a ball between your thighs, you stand on tiptoe and pulse up and down. In another you lean forward with your head on the bar, wiggling your leg while it’s extended behind you. My thighs burn, my legs tremble. Later, I am so stiff and sore I think I might have done permanent damage. IT WORKS... BUT IT HURTS . After a month of going once a week, I am gradually getting more flexible. Like most men, I have very tight hamstrings. But now my standing splits – where you bend forward, hands flat on the floor, while you try to extend one leg back and point to the ceiling – are getting a bit better. We’re told that 15 minutes of ballet can burn up to 100 calories, and my body has changed. I am slimmer: if anything, I look at bit too skinny. But the gender divide remains: in a month I only saw one other man in the class. I think that boys are scared of ballet. You have to swallow your pride, as I did, collapsing on the mat while the woman next to me did 15 push-ups with her leg in the air. To anyone who is man enough to try it, I can confirm it works. But God, it hurts. Hour-long classes start from £24 at the Barrecore  studio, Kings Road, London SW3. barrecore.co.uk.","Mick Jagger credits his fitness to regular ballet classes .

"Lulzsec has claimed a new scalp - releasing confidential material taken from the Arizona police department.
The anonymous hacking group says they've not been knocked off course, or successfully exposed, by rival hackers who claim to have named them online - apparently because they object to their agenda.
This agenda seems to have evolved. When they started out, two months ago, they said they were mainly hacking ""for laughs"".
In an online Q&A, Whirlpool, the spokesman for Lulzsec, who describes himself as ""captain of the Lulz Boat"", agreed that their goals now go beyond that: ""Politically motivated ethical hacking is more fulfilling"".
We weren't able to talk to Whirlpool in person, but met in cyberspace in a private online chat room. In those circumstances it's almost impossible to verify with absolute certainty who you are speaking to, but Newsnight was able to verify that this person had access to the @Lulzsec Twitter feed.
Here are some other edited highlights from the online chat, which began with a question about the Antisec movement  to which Lulzsec seem recently to have aligned themselves.
What is Operation Antisec in your own words?
Operation Antisec - our energy has manifested from single-drop personal operations to a global hacker movement against the common people who deem themselves oppressors, namely the world governments... Our Lulz Boat has gathered allied ships in Anonymous and several rogue hacker groups, including prominent Brazilian, Iranian, and Spanish groups.
We saw the Arizona material should we expect more today?
We're hoping to load payload bay #1 with delicious booty and release more material early next week, preferably Monday.
What do you mean by ""who deem themselves oppressors""?
Those who materialise rules to govern the oceans aren't corrupt in nature, but they soon realize that nobody will question rules that they put out,  so they use this system to abuse the public. People fear new rules, people fear the ""higher-ups"", and we're here to bring them down a few notches.
Is it the wrong rules? Or the wrong people making the rules? Would you be ok with rules, but more transparency also?
Rules are rules and we, as a people, are OK with dedicated individuals to moderate them (politicians, officials, etc) - and that's fine. However,  when our boat wants to sail into a book store, we're not going to pay Apple for a mobile reading device and subsequently purchase an application allowing us to read books, and then purchase the rights to read the book in text format. Copyright laws - a no-no. Copywrong is a constant enemy of the seas.
So copyright is one of your issues, but that's not why you attacked Arizona police. Can you explain?
Our hit on the Arizona police was to expose the corruption and racial profiling of their battle fleet. In one of the e-mails leaked, they refer to Mexicans as ""illegal aliens"" and that they need to build a bigger and bigger wall to keep them out. We have hundreds more documents ready to drop on similar corrupt states.
So immigration- quite a leap from copyright - your agenda seems quite broad? It's not just about how they handle information then?
Our targets are global. Corrupt rules and laws covers our attack vector pretty well. Cannonballs will fire at banks, police, and entire governments until we (the internet) are satisfied.
Let me ask you about your name - Lulz - making people think at first glance that you're doing all this ""for laughs""... Are you getting more serious? Or was the lulz a misconception/misunderstanding?
We've been plundering treasure chests for laughs since 1 Twitter follower - we released 73,000+ X-Factor contestants when nobody realised we existed, and we've kept up the pace. This latest operation (just before we hit 250,000 followers) invites the rest of the internet to join us, so in a sense  this sole mission is serious. But we still plan on having good laughs outside of it.
That's quite a balance to maintain. Some attracted by the Antisec agenda might be put off by the Lulz.
That's a fair point, and we're hoping Antisec extends far beyond our humble boat and into a revolution that maintains itself...
So why are they (other hackers) attacking you and claiming to expose you? Is it because of your actions or your agenda? Or just for attention?
An interesting question. It's my personal belief that they're attacking us out of raw loneliness - they've been stalking people like me for 6 months straight. They feel that we (the Lulz Boat) are their enemies. They keep trying to bring us down, we mock them, they get flustered and make snide comments, we laugh. This has been the cycle for six months. It's quite sad...
I suppose what is interesting to many now is that you have a serious agenda but you're also in it for Lulz. Will there come a time when you have to chose between them? They don't seem to sit well together if you care what the outside world thinks of you.
Another fair point. At some point our operations will have to veer onto the more serious end of things, that's true. Our pirate flag is whitehat, grayhat, and blackhat, so we often entertain many flavours of public. But yes, enjoying the breeze of politically-motivated ethical hacking is more fulfilling.","The Lulz Security hacking group that has claimed attacks on high-profile targets including the CIA and Sony in recent weeks has exclusively told the BBC's Newsnight programme that it wants to target the ""higher ups"" who write the rules and ""bring them down a few notches""."
"By . Ryan Lipman . A NSW father allegedly arranged an illegal marriage between his 12-year-old daughter and a 26-year-old man and gave her sexual advice including that she should have unprotected sex. The 61-year-old father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, allegedly organised his daughter's marriage to the Lebanese immigrant because he wanted to stop her from 'committing a life of sin'. He appeared at Burwood Local Court via video link on Wednesday and has been charged with procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activities, and being an accessory before the fact to sexual intercourse with a person under 14. Scroll down for video . Escorted to court: A 26-year-old, pictured, faced Burwood Local Court on Wednesday after illegally marrying a girl who was 12 years old at the time of marriage in January . Cannot be identified: Since the illegal marriage, the 26-year-old man and the girl have engaged in sexual activities daily, as stated in court documents . The 26-year-old Lebanese man has since had his student visa cancelled and is in immigration detention after being charged with 25 counts of sexual intercourse with a child aged between 10 and 14 years. Escorted by guards contracted by the immigration department, the man also appeared at Burwood Local Court on Wednesday. Court documents say the Hunter Valley girl met the 26-year-old University of Newcastle student at a mosque in November last year after he approached her father and asked to meet her. Police allege the young girl's father enabled his daughter's sexual assault by organising the unlawful marriage - including allowing them to swap phone numbers and meet three times in the family home before the ceremony. The father gave the girl sexual advice about contraception on the day of the wedding, according to court papers filed by police in support of an AVO application against the girl's father, The Daily Telegraph reported. 'The advice was that she should not use the contraceptive pill nor should (her husband) wear a condom when they have sexual intercourse,' the papers said. It is alleged they were married in an Islamic ceremony in the living room in January this year. The couple spent their wedding night at a motel in the Hunter region where they had sex several times, police allege. Cases adjourned: After appearing in court on Wednesday, both men had their cases adjourned until June, when they are expected to make a plea . A week after the wedding, he asked the girl's older siblings to put two single mattresses next to each other to make a queen size bed so the couple had a bed in the family home. He also asked the girl, now aged 13, if she needed to shower before morning prayer on one occasion, court documents show. 'The (girl) indicated that this is how the defendant would have known that (they) were engaged in sexual intercourse,' the papers claim. Islam requires people to shower after sex before they commence prayer, the girl allegedly told police. The imam who performed the ceremony, Muhammad Riaz Tasawar, plead guilty to solemnising the marriage and was fined $500 after. Court documents state that since the marriage the pair have engaged in sexual activities on a daily basis. 'The girl has expressed a strong desire to start a family with the 26-year-old,' the police report states. Both men had their cases adjourned until June 18, where they are expected to make a plea.

When we can’t put a name to a familiar face, or we lose our keys, most of us will see it as nothing more than a minor irritation. But for Ruth Langsford, seemingly trivial moments of forgetfulness bear a sinister warning of the illness that killed her beloved father. After watching Dennis Langsford battle Alzheimer’s for 17 years before his death aged 85 in February last year, she is terrified of following in his footsteps. The ITV1 This Morning host has described how the pain of watching her father ‘lose his identity’ to dementia was too much to bear – and she would be devastated if the same thing happened to her or her husband, Sky News reader Eamonn Holmes. The 53-year-old has spoken of her fears for the first time to help raise awareness of the Alzheimer’s Society’s helpline, which will be under pressure from increased demand during the festive season. She said: ‘I saw the detrition of my father and it is something which worries me. I worry that I have dementia in the family and one day I may get it. ‘I mean, every time you mislay your car keys or struggle to remember somebody’s name, you think, “Oh my God, here we go”. Me, my mum and my sister joke about it but obviously it is in the back of our minds and it is a worry. Deep down there is always that fear. ‘I think the thing I fear most about dementia is losing my dignity and people not understanding you. ‘I hope it never happens to me and . Eamonn. When I saw my parents, they had been married many years, and mum . started to believe he didn’t recognise her. Love: Ruth and her husband Eamonn Holmes have an 11-year-old son called Jack . ‘It absolutely broke my heart to see that and I would hope it never happens to us for that reason alone.’ However, Miss Langsford said she still doesn’t believe in using technology to find out if she’s at risk of developing the disease. ‘I believe there are blood tests that you can undergo to find out if you are going to get it but I don’t think I would want to know,’ said Miss Langsford, who has an 11-year-old son called Jack with Holmes, 54. ‘Because I know the illness can’t be cured, I know there is no happy ending and why would you want to know when there is no preventative? It isn’t like there is someone to say if you drink this syrup every day then you won’t get Alzheimer’s, so I don’t see the point in being told now. Fear: Ruth, who hosts This Morning with her husband, says she doesn't want to know what lies ahead . ‘I know what my life would be, and it is enough to have seen someone go through it than to be burdened with the knowledge it is going to happen to you too.’ The Alzheimer’s Society’s national dementia helpline receives 38,000 calls annually, with a higher volume during Christmas when families are reunited. Miss Langsford is also helping the Dementia Friends campaign, which provides support to carers and the families of sufferers. The scheme helps to teach patients’ loved-ones how to communicate with them and explains the effects of the illness. For confidential advice, information and support, call Alzheimer's Society's National Dementia Helpline on 0300 222 11 22.

"By . Neil Sears . PUBLISHED: . 19:29 EST, 29 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:25 EST, 29 October 2012 . 'Off-payroll': Paula Higson, head of IPSA . The head of the watchdog monitoring MPs’ expenses is being paid up to £169,000 a year in an ‘off-payroll’ deal allowing her to reap huge tax benefits, it can be revealed. Paula Higson, acting chief executive of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), earns the equivalent of up to £169,000 a year not through a normal salary, but through her private limited company. Ipsa, set up in 2009 in the wake of the MPs’ parliamentary expenses scandal, states that its main duty is ‘to serve the interests of the public’. However, it pays Mrs Higson in a deal allowing her to save thousands of pounds in national insurance and income tax – while Ipsa cuts its own national insurance payouts. Earlier this year Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander condemned similar ‘off-payroll’ arrangements saying they aided ‘tax avoidance’. Mrs Higson, who runs a private consultancy business, declined an opportunity to outline her tax payments. Ipsa also refused to give more details – even though its own website details staff expenses as small as a a ‘fruit basket’ worth £20. Mrs Higson is already familiar with ‘off-payroll’ deals. After leaving her last salaried job, earning £110,000 a year as chief operating officer at NHS Direct, she switched to working on contract at the same employer for £132,000 a year. The arrangement would have slashed her own national insurance and income tax liability. Miss Higson, who lives in a £1million house in Twickenham, west London, also appears to be continuing to be available for other work  while being paid to monitor MPs’ expenses, with her website fully operational. 'Contractor': Mrs Higson joined Ipsa in July this year as acting Chief Executive . Condemning: Earlier this year Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander spoke out about similar 'off-payroll' arrangements saying they aided 'tax avoidance' Last night angry MPs spoke out over the arrangement. Tory MP Rob Wilson, who campaigns against off-payroll deals in the public sector, said: ‘It is scandalous if an organisation charged with upholding the integrity of the MPs’ expenses system is itself paying people involved in tax avoidance.’ Former Labour minister Tom Harris said: ‘It is shocking if Ipsa is paying anyone a penny towards any form of tax avoidance.’ Mrs Higson joined Ipsa in July this year after Andrew McDonald, its chief executive – who is paid  £110,000 a year through a normal salary arrangement – required cancer treatment. She is paid £650 a day through her private limited company for 50 days’ work over four months – the equivalent of up to £169,000 a year. Mrs Higson said in a statement: ‘In the two years I’ve been running a small business, I have paid the taxes I should. 'I have not carried out any proactive marketing while I’ve been doing work for Ipsa. For a 50-day contract, I am not going to close my website.’ An Ipsa spokesman said: ‘Mrs Higson is being paid as a contractor, not an employee, to provide 50 days of cover. 'The appointment complies with the Treasury’s guidelines for interim staff.’","Ipsa was set up in 2009 in the wake of the .

"It's a Saturday night in Sisaket, a small town in Thailand's Isan province, and huge crowds have gathered around a makeshift boxing ring ahead of the big fight. But the two promising fighters about to take to the ring aren't your average boxers: Instead, they're an 11-year-old boy named Nat Thanarak and his opposition - a 12-year-old called Nong Em. Muay Thai is one of the toughest martial arts in the world and children as young as seven are paid to compete in vicious bouts that attract bets which run into thousands of baht. Scroll down for video . Painful: A little boy grimaces during a bout. Thai boxing allows strikes with the feet and elbows as well as fists . Professional: Despite his lack of years, Nat Thanarak, 11, is a professional Thai boxer . Thailand has an estimated 30,000 child boxers but the impact of beginning a fighting career so young can be severe, with brain damage comparable to that seen in car accident victims and early onset dementia among the risks. Despite the risks, it is not illegal for children to fight provided they have their parents permission. But although young fighters are supposed to wear padded clothing, in practice, they rarely do. Even if it means the chance of serious injury to their children, in poverty-stricken regions such as Isan, the lure of prize money can prove too much to resist - with or without pads. One such fighter is Nat Thanarak, a boy from a poor family whose main source of income is the pittance his mother, a nanny working in Bangkok, sends them each month. The money he makes is the difference between eating and starving and so, the little boy lives a life that involves four hours of training each day, a strict diet and little time for play. 'I do it because I get money,' he explains in his childish treble. Asked what he'd do should he manage to win one of the more lucrative fights staged in Bangkok, he replies: 'Buy a motorbike!' Tiny: Despite risking brain damage, dementia and serious injury, children as young as seven compete . Fighter: Nat Thanarak and his father Watchara who says he worries about what might happen to his son . His . upcoming fight with Nong Em is an important one and has attracted huge . bets, including a 50,000 baht (£1,000) flutter raised by his village - a . vast amount in Thailand, where £1,000 is more than the average person . earns in a year. But . to win it, he needs to weigh 25kg and is currently 3kg overweight. As a . result, his father Watchara has cranked up his regime, which already involves . push-ups, lifting oil cans and building up his neck muscles courtesy of a . chunk of concrete attached to his hat. 'This is the most important fight of his career,' explains Mr Thanarak. 'But he needs to lose three kilos before he can fight.' His solution is drastic. Daily 8km runs in 30 degree heat, all while sporting a sweat suit in a bid to get rid of excess water and help him lose weight. The competition: Nat will face 12-year-old Nong Em who won his first fight with a knock out aged seven . Working out: In a bid to lose weight, Nat does 8km runs in 30 degree heat while wearing a sweat suit . Despite the dangers, unemployed Mr Thanarak says he has no choice. 'Sometimes we can't make ends meet,' he explains. 'We are broke and have to borrow money. 'If he didn't fight, I would go to work in Bangkok with my wife and send . money back to my kids,' he continues. 'Sometimes Nat realises how much is riding on his boxing but sometimes he doesn't . because he's too young. He wants to play - he misses his friends.' But not being able to play is the least of Nat's concerns. As researchers at Bangkok's Ramathibodi Hospital have revealed, the child risks far more than limited playtime. 'Their brains are still growing,' explains Professor Jiraporn Laothamatas. 'When you do damage to a child, it's much more severe than in an adult. Education: Children who show promise in Muay Thai are sent to boxing camps with fees paid from winnings . Brutal: Children taking part in Muay Thai bouts can kick and elbow their way to victory as well as punch . Known as 'the art of eight limbs' Muay Thai involves using the arms, shins, fists and feet to overcome opponents. Invented in Thailand, the sport became widely popular after being incorporated into military training by King Naresuan in 1560. Until recently, bonds made from knotted rope were used to protect the knuckles and damage the opposing fighter but after several deaths, they were exchanged for padded gloves in the 1990s. 'There . might be some lower intelligence level compared to normal standard . kids. Some dementia might happen. Some don't think well, don't feel well . but they don't know how to tell what's different to them.' Mr Thanarak is not unaware of the risks and says he does worry about the risk of brain injury. 'I am worried about damage to his brain . but my son loves boxing,' he says. 'He wants to fight. I told him to stop after the . last fight. He refused. If he doesn't fight, our money will go . down and that's a problem because the money is supporting our family. 'The fact is, I don't want him to fight. He's still so young.' For his own part, Nat says he wants to carry on. 'I will continue training,' he insists. 'It makes me strong and it will make my village famous.' It might also leave him with brain damage but for now, little Nat and thousands like him will continue to risk life and limb in the boxing ring. See the whole story in Unreported World, tonight at 7.30pm on Channel 4 .

Ivory Coast stallholders turn to digital marketplace
South African education goes digital
Kenya's mobile money revolution
Africa mobile boom powers innovation
Is tech saving the music industry?
It kills more mothers and babies than anywhere else in the world, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).
Some progress is being made. In Ghana, for example, the Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) declined by 49% between 1990 and 2013 to 380 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013 - but this still leaves some way to go to reach the United Nations Millennium Development Goal of 185.
On the veranda of the small, squat bungalow that is the Ahentia Community Based Planning and Service (CHPs) clinic sits a group of women.  Some are pregnant, some nursing babies, they are waiting patiently to see the community health officer.
What makes this situation a little different is that each of them has been reminded about their appointment by messages sent to a mobile phone, through a system called Mobile Midwife.
They also receive regular messages with individually-tailored information on everything from eating properly to when to give up manual labour to important treatment and vaccination advice.
Cynthia Larbie is pregnant with her second child.
""When I was pregnant for the first time I would have enemas, which are supposed to be good for you and the baby. But listening to messages from Mobile Midwife, I learnt they can cause your baby to be aborted,"" she says.
""The reminders really help, too. Because I wasn't sure when my first baby would arrive, I gave birth at home, but this time being told that I'm close to delivery means that I'm prepared and ready to give birth at the clinic.""
Getting women in rural areas to attend antenatal appointments regularly isn't easy, says community health officer Alice Grant-Yamoah.
""Most of the mothers are illiterate, so when we wrote the date [down], they forgot about it,"" she says.
""[Mobile midwife] saves mothers' lives. Because in this community we believe â€¦ superstitions. For example you go and meet a mother at home, telling [her] to come for antenatal care.
""[They say] If I come the evil eye will look at me and I will lose my baby. That's what I did with my previous babies and I lost the babies.""
Mobile midwife is part of the Ghana mobile technology for community health (Motech Ghana) initiative - a collaboration between the non-profit organisation Grameen Foundation and the Ghana Health Service.
In a country where there are more active mobile phone lines than people (although using several Sim cards is common, so this doesn't mean that everyone has a mobile phone), using the technology to reach women and connect healthcare facilities makes sense.
When a woman signs up for the service, she is assigned a unique number.
After each appointment, the nurse updates her medical records electronically using a mobile phone. By reviewing a digitally-generated monthly report, she can see who has had the correct vaccinations, for example. It also means that the health service can gather centralised data on maternal health in the region.
The platform is now used in seven districts across Ghana. A desk-top nurse application has been developed to make it easier to enter large amounts of data, as well as an app for android smartphones.
""We've also seen an increase in immunisation coverage, because the messages are around from pregnancy to the start of life. We've seen an increase in the number of mothers coming to the facility to deliver. And also we've seen that many more of the mothers are very knowledgeable about health issues,"" says Patricia Antwi, district director of health services for Awutu-Senya district.
Challenges remain, however - in rural areas network coverage can be patchy, and communities are often off the national grid, with no way to charge a mobile. And mobile phone ownership is lowest amongst poor, rural women, according to Eddie Ademozoya, Grameen's head of implementation for the Motech Platform.
""Mobile literacy has [also] been an issue in a developing country like this,"" he says.
""We have piloted a system of equipping Mobile Midwife agents with a solar charging device so that they can charge the mobile phones of women in the communities for a fee. It's designed in the form of a business-in-a-box.""
For the Grameen Foundation, the time has come to hand over the running of the platform in Ghana to the Ghana Health Service. But that doesn't mean that their involvement is over.
""We've re-engineered [the Motech platform] to make it more robust, to make it scale, so it can serve the whole nation instead of just districts,"" says Grameen's director of technology innovation David Hutchful.
The suite is now being offered as an open source download, and is being used elsewhere in Africa, Asia and South America not only for maternal health but as an HIV medication reminder service and for general health management among other things.
Several worlds away from rural Ghana lies the capital, Accra. It's a bustling, booming, often gridlocked city with budding aspirations to rival Africa's technology hubs Nairobi and neighbouring Lagos.
Like much of west Africa, many of the clinics and other healthcare facilities servicing the city still rely on time-consuming paper and print to coordinate operations - meaning there's often (if not usually) a large backlog of paperwork and insurance documents waiting to be dealt with.
""A few months ago, I walked into a hospital that we are engaging and I found a notice that says, if you are from a particular insurance company, services have been suspended,"" says Seth Akumani, chief executive and co-founder of start-up ClaimSync.
""So, if you are, for instance, a patient who is returning for a follow-up visit you basically have to pay cash or you will be turned away.""
ClaimSync started life at the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) in Accra.
""Our initial idea was to build a platform to make it easy for patients to access their records,"" says Mr Akumani. ""We went out and talked to a lot of hospitals, the insurance companies, to try and understand the main points. Then we found out there is actually a gap between the hospitals and insurance companies.""
The software creates an integrated electronic medical records system that aims to link every department in a healthcare facility to a central database, integrating the process so that everyone from the receptionist to the doctor to the lab to the pharmacy can track a patient's progress.
This means that not only should there be no chance of mistakes being made because different departments don't speak to each other, but the paperless system should save time and increase efficiency.
Insurance claim documents can be generated automatically and sent off. And if the insurer is also using ClaimSync software it can be received almost immediately.
""Insurance companies can log on to our online platform and receive the claims in batches,"" says Mr Akumani. ""They can drill down and see the details of a single paper claim. They can accept or reject items on these claims and import them into the internal system for further processing.""
The platform is currently being used at the Danpong Clinic in Accra.
Osei Antobre is the Medical Services Manager at the facility, and says that the software has improved confidentiality and increased efficiency.
Now clients give permissions and personal details once only, rather every time they visit.
""Since the introduction of the software....we just visit the database that we have there, their information, and then we process them right from there. The speed of the process is top for us.""
ClaimSync's integrated approach has won fans - the startup has been snapped up by Dutch biometric identity management company GenKey.
According to Mr Akumani this means that they will be able to add GenKey's technology to the platform, which uses fingerprints and other biometric data to identify claimants accurately. This should help weed out fraudulent insurance claims and open up an international market, he believes.
Healthcare facilities where paperwork gets in the way of patient care, and where a lack of properly integrated technology means mistakes are more likely to happen, are not unique to Ghana.
They're not even unique to the developing world. And the appetite for technology to plug these gaps is massive.
But having answers to these problems provided by Ghanaians for Ghanaians is important, according to Grameen's David Hutchful.
""It's important that a platform like Motech was first sort of thought of in Ghana, because there are a lot of unique problems and issues that affect Ghana and other developing countries.
""Motech initially was developed with Kenyan developers and then it was opened up to the rest of the world.  We have Indians working on it, we have people in Poland working on it, people in the US working on it.
""But having it start from here was very important - to have that sort of local understanding of the problem feed into the actual code that ends up this being this whole platform.""",Giving birth in Sub-Saharan Africa is a risky business.

"FA head of security Tony Conniford admitted that the association is 'freaking out over safety in Rio' FA head of security Tony Conniford said senior figures in the England set-up were ‘freaking out’ over reports of crime and violence from Rio’s gang-ridden shanty towns, or favelas, the largest of which,  Rocinha, is near England’s hotel. He also raised the astonishing prospect that England stars such as Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard could be stuck on the team bus for up to four hours in gridlocked traffic as they travel nine miles to and from their training base. While officially the FA say they are ‘fully confident’ in security arrangements, former policeman Mr Conniford’s comments, overheard by a Mail on Sunday reporter in the bar of the England hotel in Rio, raise questions about preparations. Mr Conniford’s assessment was delivered in a loud voice to a Brazilian colleague. A reporter from this newspaper was having a meal at a nearby table and was able to take notes. Mr Conniford, a 30-year veteran of Essex Police, told the Brazilian, an ex-military officer: ‘The problems here have been all over the papers. It’s bad. I get calls from management, from my bosses at the FA, freaking out saying, “Tony, are you sure it’s safe?” ‘They ask me, “Is this really going to be safe for the team?” They are worried. These are real concerns. ‘We have to be extra vigilant. We cannot afford to make any mistakes. Security must be paramount.’ Mr Conniford’s comments – coming just a month before the tournament kicks off – raise serious question marks over the FA’s decision to base themselves in central Rio. England’s hotel, the ageing Royal Tulip, is rated by travel website TripAdvisor as only the 93rd best in the city. Only one other team – Holland, who will train much closer to their hotel – are based in the city, while Germany have built their own private beach resort to stay in. England's hotel is located within view of the Rocinha favela in Rio where armed gangs are being targeted by police . Mr Conniford told his colleague that a nine-mile trip between the squad’s training base in a military camp at Sao Joao Fort in Urca in the shadow of Sugarloaf mountain and the hotel had taken him two hours. He said: ‘The traffic is awful. Even with a police escort it will be a nightmare. The roads are terrible. The traffic is my biggest worry. This is a logistical nightmare. We have to work on how we get the team from A to B without getting held up. ‘We will be stuck in traffic the whole time.’ The airport, where the England players and their retinue, totalling no fewer than 78 people, will have to travel to to get to their group games, is even further away. Mr Conniford said he also had concerns about security within the Urca military base when England were training. He told the Brazilian: ‘Your guys need to know they can challenge anyone to see their badges. They must check and re-check everyone.’ And on hotel security, he said: ‘We can’t afford to let anyone in because once you are through that door out there you can go straight to the lift and get straight up to the players’ rooms in no time.’ As more than 50,000 England fans prepare to descend on Brazil, it is hard to imagine they have much idea of what actually awaits them: . Heavily armed snipers have been tasked to patrol the Rocinha favela, near where the England team will be based for the World Cup . Brazilian authorities are having difficulties clamping down violence in advance of the World Cup . The host cities for England’s first games – Manaus, Sao Paolo and Belo Horizonte – are plagued by robberies, murders and muggings. Sao Paolo has its own slum problem and, in Manaus, a steaming jungle city a four-hour flight north of Rio, child ‘gangs’ roam the streets robbing visitors at knifepoint. The violence shows no sign of abating. One person was shot dead on Friday as Rio police clashed with armed men in a favela close to the England hotel. Over the past six years the Rio authorities have established 39 so-called police pacification units, or UPPs, in the favelas in an attempt to smash drug and street gangs. England captain Steven Gerrard  and his team will be based within view of Rio's biggest slum as they prepare for their three World Cup group matches . More than 50,000 England fans are expected to travel to the tournament where there have been regular violent protests . Adrian Bevington, Managing Director of Club England, said: ‘The FA are confident in the security arrangements in place. Tony is a vastly experienced officer and was simply overheard doing his job. He has our full support.’ Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris, who is a qualified referee and member of the All-Party Parliamentary Football Group, said last night: ‘Like every English fan, I want our team and its management to be as safe as possible and would expect these concerns to have been addressed by now.’ An FA source said that Mr Conniford was using the opportunity to emphasise to Brazilian authorities that their extra support is appreciated and the conversation was private.","In England's dilapidated hotel next to the gangland slum, he tells of 'real concerns' for our players .

The attorney who successfully defended Casey Anthony is now representing one of the young Florida girls accused of cyber-stalking to the point she committed suicide. Jose Baez will represent Katelyn Roman, 12, when she goes to trial to face accusations of bullying Rebecca Sedwick, 12, to the point she committed suicide last month. When reached Wednesday by MailOnline, a spokesperson for Mr Baez said he was not available for comment because he was spending the entire day getting to know the family and reviewing the case. Well known: Casey Anthony attorney Jose Baez will represent Katelyn Roman, 12, in her cyber-bullying trial . Made famous for defending Ms Anthony to a jury that found her not guilty of murdering her daughter, Mr Baez was approached by the Roman family, the spokesperson said. The Orlando Sentinel first reported he had been hired to represent the 12-year-old girl. News of his retention comes on the heels of reports that Tricia Norman, Ms Sedwick’s mother, hired attorney David Henry. It is not clear what Mr Henry’s course of action will be, but an announcement on his law firm’s website did offer some clues. ‘We’re going to look at every possible potentially responsible party,’ Mr Henry said. ‘We applaud the efforts of Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd and his office in investigating and responding to this tragedy.’ Echoing the comments of Polk County . Sheriff Grady Judd, Mr Henry explained that the two teens ‘repeatedly . and maliciously’ cyberbullied Ms Sedwick, including telling her to . ‘drink bleach and die,’ as well as kill herself.

A computer in a child’s bedroom is their porthole to the outside world,’ said Mr Henry. ‘Cyberbullying has become a pervasive problem among our children and it needs to stop,’ he added. It is not known if Guadalupe Shaw, 14, has yet hired an attorney. She remains in custody. Tormented by the relentless bullying, Ms Sedwick jumped to her death from a silo at a cement plant not far from her home.

"The number of non-EU migrants who come to the UK to study but remain five years later could be about half that ministers claim, say researchers.
The ""current self-destructive policy is deterring genuine international students"", says the Institute for Public Policy Research.
Ministers say it is crucial to crack down on immigration abuse.
Ministers say official statistics suggest that each year about 91,000 non-EU students do not leave the UK at the end of their studies.
This figure is an extrapolation of data from the International Passenger Survey (IPS) carried out annually by the Home Office on a sample of travellers at UK ports, says the IPPR.
Arrivals who plan to stay more than a year are asked their main reason for coming to the UK - and people who leave after more than a year are asked what they were doing while they were in the UK.
For students, the difference between the two figures is about 90,000 - so reducing this figure would help the government in its objective of cutting overall net migration.
But this approach is based on ""dubious evidence"", says the report.
Other ways of counting international students put the figure at less than half that suggested by the passenger survey, say the researchers:
""The large discrepancy between the other sources' figures and that of the IPS suggest that the latter's 90,000 figure is not reliable enough to be used as a guide for policy,"" says the report.
""While it is certainly right to root out abuse and tackle bogus colleges where there is robust evidence of wrongdoing, these rules have adversely affected genuine students and institutions, and have undermined the UK's reputation as a desirable destination for international students,"" it adds.
""Our research suggests that many of the students they are targeting may be phantom students who are no longer in the country,"" said report author Marley Morris.
The report urges the government to:
Seamus Nevin, head of employment and skills policy at the Institute of Directors, agreed it was time for the government to re-evaluate its approach to international students.
""Restrictive student and post-study visa rules undermine the UK's claim to be an open, outward facing, trading nation,"" he said.
""Most students who come to the UK to study are not permanent migrants.""
And the umbrella group Universities UK urged the government to view international students as ""valuable temporary visitors"".
A Home Office spokesman said: ""We continue to welcome the brightest and best to our world-class institutions. We are also committed to bringing net migration down to sustainable levels as soon as possible and are looking at all visa routes as part of that work.""","The government might be targeting ""phantom students"" in its efforts to control migration, a study suggests."

"By . Associated Press . A New Jersey family whose terrier-pitbull mix escaped from their backyard during Superstorm Sandy went to an animal shelter this week to adopt a new pet and came home with their old dog. Chuck James tells The Associated Press that his family searched for their brown-and-white dog named Reckless for months after the October 2012 storm before finally giving up hope. 'We reported him missing and called the shelters periodically, just hoping they had him,' James said Saturday. 'We always kept our hopes up, but eventually it's time to move on.""' The happy family! Chuck and Elicia James are seen here reunited with dog Reckless, who they lost during Superstorm Sandy . James said the family had planned in recent weeks to get a new dog as a 10th birthday surprise for their eldest daughter, Ally. The couple has two other children, Kelsey and Liam. But when the family of five went to the Monmouth County SPCA on Thursday to adopt a new animal, James and his wife approached the first cage and saw a familiar face inside. 'He was a little bigger than I remembered because they had fed him well,' James joked. 'But then he was laying on my wife's feet, and I knew it was him. ... I was in disbelief. I know this dog is meant to be with our family.' When SPCA officials asked if they could prove the animal was their dog, a friend sent over a picture showing the family with their dog before Sandy hit the Jersey shore.

"Bronca, Diego Maradona called it. The emotion was his driving force throughout his career. Marcela Mora y Araujo, translator of his autobiography El Diego, described it as representing ‘anger, fury, hatred, resentment and bitter discontent’. It would appear Luis Suarez, perhaps the player most like Maradona at this World Cup, is motivated by bronca, too. Nothing else explains his mood swings, his brilliant destructiveness, the intensity of his creative blaze and sudden self-immolation. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the moment Suarez appears to bite Chiellini . Passion: Luis Suarez seems to be driven by an emotion referred to by Diego Maradona as bronca . Driven: Maradona claimed bronca represented his 'anger, fury, hatred, resentment and bitter discontent' Suarez was angry long before he sank his teeth into defender Giorgio Chiellini. He was angry after defeating England the week before, angry on the eve of the final group meeting with Italy, too. He used every opportunity to rail against his critics, his detractors in England, those who dare to suggest that football is better without racism, cheating and acts of aggravated bodily harm. It is as if he possesses dual personalities. There is the Suarez whom team-mates recognise, and he is a universally popular figure. This Suarez gives selflessly for his team, is a disciplined and dedicated trainer and a quiet family man, still devoted to his childhood sweetheart and their young family. Controversy: Suarez (9) clearly moves in to bite Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini . Then there is the Suarez possessed by bronca, uncontrolled, without boundaries, illogical. Viewed together this pair make no sense, Jekyll and Hyde but without the potions. It does not follow that Suarez can depart from reality into a state where he is moved to bite another human being. It does not follow that this behaviour is repeated, that it has a pattern immune to censure or judgement. What Suarez does baffles all understanding. It is as if he is, in the truest sense of the phrase, out of his mind. If it were possible to review a substantial library of great and important goals that had been scored by virtue of biting an opponent, it would not make his behaviour correct, but it would at least begin to explain the motivation. If there were games that had been won only because of occlusive biting, there could at least be understanding. We do not condone diving or simulation in the area, either, but we accept it can get results. Flashpoint: Suarez holds his teeth in pain after the incident during Uruguay 1-0 Italy . Yet what Suarez does can only have a negative effect. At worst, he is sent off, or banned, if spotted. At best? Well, what is the positive outcome here? Chiellini was not going to become incapacitated, unable to continue due to his injuries. Biting, while horrible, is in fact a rather inefficient way of gaining advantage over an opponent. The best Suarez could hope for was shock. Yet England’s defenders also looked pretty shocked in Sao Paulo, and no teeth were bared to achieve that outcome. Suarez is at his least dangerous when he opens his mouth. It is his feet, and his brain, that terrify, combining to provide the movement, instinct and clinical nature that are his most effective qualities. Biting, Suarez is almost worthless. Shocking: Chiellini displays bite marks on his shoulder after the incident, but the referee wasn't swayed . So why do it? Any mental health professional will say it is a spontaneous act. Suarez did not go into the match with Italy thinking he would bite Chiellini, given the chance. It is also an opportunist crime, and born out of fear. Suarez has a history of biting, but usually when the game is not going well. He was murdering England, and behaved impeccably, he was frustrated by Italy when the bronca overwhelmed him. This conforms to type. Suarez was getting little joy against Chelsea the day he bit Branislav Ivanovic, and Liverpool were losing at the time. The Ajax match in which he bit Otman Bakkal of PSV Eindhoven in 2010 ended in a 0-0 draw. Psychologists will also say Suarez bites when he feels threatened or is unnerved by circumstances. There is no record of an attack being perpetrated when his team are winning, or even in a game in which he has already scored. Previous: Suarez has a history of biting when the game isn't going his way . This excuses nothing, of course, because what English football has found is that Suarez does not respond to patience, understanding and our most decent human emotions. He responds to a big stick. He had his greatest season in the last campaign for Liverpool, following a 10-match ban for biting Ivanovic. Yet in the loving arms of la celeste he goes unchallenged, unquestioned, unchecked. Uruguay are Suarez-dependent. They need him like an addict needs his fix. Nothing he does can be wrong. And Suarez indulged is Suarez unhinged. That is why we are back here again. Cristiano Ronaldo has found it close to impossible to affect Portugal at this World Cup, yet Uruguay have been driven to eliminate England, and then Italy, by Suarez. He is the nearest in talent to Maradona here in his ability to singlehandedly drive a team. Angry: Branislav Ivanovic (left) was getting the better of Suarez during Chelsea's 2-2 draw with Liverpool . The return is that nothing he does can be wrong in their eyes. Uruguay’s part in this Faustian pact is that they will defend the indefensible, endorse the ludicrous and feed  paranoia, a perverse victim mentality, that is plainly unhealthy. Oscar Tabarez is a hugely respected coach on the South American continent, who even Maradona refers to as el maestro, yet he, too, was moved to foolishness by his refusal to acknowledge that Suarez had done wrong. Tabarez claimed the allegations were a conspiracy, conducted by people ‘hiding in trees’. That Suarez’s act was beamed live across the world escaped him. Diego Lugano, Uruguay’s captain, said Chiellini was a snitch and had shown the referee an old scar. Similar: Suarez (right) is the nearest in talent to Maradona in his ability to single-handedly  drive a team . Even those from Uruguay who are here, ostensibly, as impartial observers failed to locate their critical faculties. There was no front-page controversy over Suarez in Uruguay and the website of the main football television network in the country, Tenfield, carried instead a bizarre rant about England’s controversial World Cup goal in 1966. There was no front-page controversy over Suarez in Uruguay and the website of the main football television network in the country, Tenfield, carried instead a bizarre rant about England’s controversial World Cup goal in 1966. ‘It would be good if these English people who are worried and are pushing to have Suarez suspended can explain how they won the World Cup in 1966 with a goal that wasn’t a goal, one that bounced in front of the goal-line after hitting the underside of the crossbar,’ said Tenfield’s correspondent, utilising logic that could have explained Suarez’s bite on Ivanovic away as a response to a tackle by Chopper Harris in 1968. Investigation: The Uruguay star looks concerned as he walks through the team hotel in Natal, Brazil . Sunderland manager Gus Poyet, a former Uruguay international with 26 caps, attempted to explain the different cultures before the World Cup began by saying that where Suarez comes from there is not such a strong ethical pressure around a sporting contest. ‘I know that for you a handball on the goal-line is cheating,’ he said, ‘but not for us. It’s part of the game. If I’m the last man and you’re running and I pull your shirt and you go down and I get sent off — is that cheating? No, it’s not cheating.’ Yet, around Suarez, such moral ambivalence can have dangerous consequences. The hangers-on and ego-fluffers amid his employers and advisers conspire to indulge Suarez the monster, while only the quiet men of the FA’s disciplinary arm have succeeded in controlling those animalistic excesses. Going? English football will be missed if he decides to leave Liverpool in the summer . Everything he rails against in English football — the critics, the press, those who decry a destructive attitude he confuses indulgently with desire — are actually all that is good for him. Pandered to by his coach, his grateful team-mates and a slavish, cheerleading media, he is then set on a course of self-destruction. That is the Suarez irony. He feels he punished England with the goals that ended this country’s World Cup ambitions. He feels he was avenged. Yet avenged for what, exactly? Everything he despises about the English game is what keeps him in check. If Suarez plays no further part in this World Cup, or in football for many months to come, it will be because he failed to learn the lessons of his brief exposure to the standards of the English game. If only he knew it, we’re the best friends he has.","Diego Maradona claimed an emotion called 'bronca' was his driving force throughout his career .

Now her lawyers have launched a constitutional challenge to the ban on Muslim veils, arguing that the controversial law of 2011 which made them illegal should be scrapped. Belin’s husband, Michael Khiri, was arrested for insulting one of the officers who stopped his wife in Trappes during the Muslim fasting period of Ramadan. This led to a large crowd gathering on the couple’s housing estate, where hundreds of mainly Muslim immigrants live. Soon bus stops and other public property was being destroyed, as running battles took place between youths and the police. Belin, a Muslim convert who has worn a veil all her adult life, was outraged when her husband received a three-month suspended prison sentence. In October, Belin herself went on trial for defying the ban on Islamic veils and for insulting a police officer. Many conservative politicians claim that France's 6million-plus Muslims are changing the nature of the country. Above, a protest against the burka ban in Paris in 2010 . Now her lawyer has launched a constitutional challenge to the entire burka ban at the criminal court in Versailles, west of Paris. Philippe Bataille told the court that the ban was discriminatory, unconstitutional, and against the guiding principles of the French Republic. Mr Bataille said his client was deliberating shunning the hearing because ‘she does not want to be wrongly perceived as the symbol of a supposed rampant Islamisation'.

"Beijing (CNN) -- It is a striking image that in an instant crystallizes the passions and anger on the streets of Beijing. A man is leaning out of the sunroof of a car driving down a six-lane freeway, holding a massive Chinese flag in one hand and, in the other, a portrait of Mao Zedong. ""The islands are ours,"" he yells, referring to China's claim on what it calls the Diaoyu islands. He denounces Japan, and others in the car raised clenched fists, threatening to go to war. Protests have flared for another day across the country. This is not just any day, it is the anniversary of the incident that set off the Japanese invasion of China in 1931. The wounds of history run deep amongst generations raised on stories of the brutality of Japanese occupation. The row over the islands is tearing at those old scars. These are indeed confused times; old-style Maoism, anti-Japanese hatred, ancient territorial claims and a rich nation's hunger for national resources are fueling passionate and at times violent protests aimed at the Japanese. The islands dispute is a magnet for a grab bag of competing agendas. Japanese plants close amid Chinese fury . The open displays of anti-Japanese fury, say some China watchers, is a convenient distraction for the Communist Party as it grapples with a fraught leadership transition marked by political scandal, murder, ""disappearances"" and infighting. The appearance of the iconic Mao images lends a revolutionary fervor to these protests. The father of China's Communist Party is not seen as synonymous with the new economic powerhouse. He harks back to a more brutal time. But this is not just about anger and pride, it is about money. Lying beneath the uninhabited islands are vast natural resources. China is hungry for oil and gas to power its economy. But most of the argument here is framed around history; unfinished business with Japan and China's rising economic significance in the world. Chinese analysts like Guo Xiangjiang, the Deputy Director of the China Institute of International Studies, say there should be no question about who owns the islands. ""There shouldnÂ¹t be any discussion on Diaoyu island. It has always been a part of China,"" he says. China says its claim on Diaoyu extends back hundreds of years. Japan says China ceded sovereignty when it lost the Sino-Japanese war in 1895. Japan's surrender in World War II clouded the issue again. How a remote rock split China and Japan . But in 1972, the United States returned Senkaku to Japanese control as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. China refuses to recognize these agreements. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman, Hong Lei, has effectively told the U.S. to keep out of the issue. ""We hope that the U.S. can earnestly honor its principle of not taking positions on the Diaoyu issue,"" he said. On the streets it is all about Japan. Thousands marched outside the Japan embassy in China Tuesday. ""Kill Japan!"" one woman yells. Another turns the question on us. ""Would you not fight for Hawaii? Would you not fight for Washington D.C? Of course we will fight for Diaoyu,"" the protester asks. China normally clamps down on protests like this. Public displays of anger are not allowed. But this is different: this is Japan. Nationalism works for the party right now, Mao images and all; better to keep the people focused on an enemy outside than the enemies within.","Passion and anger merges in Chinese street protests .

"Jellyfish, a common summertime nuisance, may be more dangerous than once thought. The sea creatures have been around for half a billion years - and new information alleges that they are growing in numbers, killing people and wreaking havoc in the oceans. Lisa-ann Gershwin's book 'Stung! On Jellyfish and the Future of the Oceans,' describes the danger jellyfish pose and how they have overrun various ecosystems. Much of the species' success, she says is based on their life cycle. 'Hermaphroditism. Cloning. External fertilization. Self fertilization. Courtship and copulation. Fission. Fusion. Cannibalism. You name it, jellyfish [are] ""doing it,""' she says. Jellyfish, like the ones seen in this file photo, are growing in numbers, even as other species die and are wiped out . One jellyfish, the Mnemiopsis, is able to lay eggs when it is just 13 days old without needing a mate. It soon is able to lay 10,000 eggs per day. It also can eat over ten times its own body weight in food and can double in size each day. Other jellyfish are extremely difficult to kill. When faced with death, some can 'de-grow' - which means that 'they reduce in size, but their bodies remain in proportion,' the New York Review of Books says. Another species, the zombie jelly, is seemingly immortal. When its particles disintegrate, cells escape and form an entirely new jelly. This period of growth happens within five days. Jellyfish have been strengthening their numbers and now appear at beaches all over the world, like in this file photo . Complex ecosystems, Gershwin says, at what have kept the jellyfish at bay. However, she claims that human involvement and manipulation have catapulted their growth and helped their numbers to explode. Gershwin claims that overfishing anchovies, which compete with jellyfish for food, have created swarms of the sea creatures in South Africa. Jellyfish competitors quickly die out, leaving a 'stingy-slimy killing field,' she says. Plastic bags and drift lines may also destroy the few natural jellyfish predators, like sea turtles. Jellyfish also use hard litter, like industrial waste, to form expansive nurseries. Rising acid and carbon dioxide levels have been noted to kill off many fish species. Jellyfish, however, reportedly thrive in these harsh environments. They release waste with high carbon levels -- which bacteria use to create 'carbon dioxide factories,' Gershwin says. One example is the Gulf of Mexico -- in 2000, jellyfish took over an area of sixty square miles. They survived the damage wrought by Hurricane Katrina and the 2011 oil spill, when thousands of other species died. Jellyfish have thrived in the harsh Gulf of Mexico, as seen in this undated file photo, while thousands of other species have died . These combined factors, she says, are what have allowed jellyfish to take over 'one bite at a time.''[There will be] no coral reefs teeming with life. No more mighty whales or wobbling penguins. No lobsters or oysters,' Gershwin says. Jellyfish, like both the box jelly and Irukandji species, have taken dozens of lives. Box jellies can kill within two minutes, the New York Review of Books reports. Irukandji, which can cause extreme cramps, spasms, and vomiting, have taken countless victims. Many deaths are misdiagnosed as strokes and heart attacks. In groups, jellyfish 'have an uncanny knack for getting stuck,' Gershwin writes. They can get sucked in and latch on to heavy structures. In July 2006, jellyfish were sucked into the US Ronald Reagan, wiping out onboard capabilities. Japanese power plants have been 'under attack' from jellyfish since the 1960s, claims the New York Review of Books. The damage may be permanent, Gershwin says. 'I think I underestimated how severely we have damaged our oceans and their inhabitants. I now think that we have pushed them too far [...] without us knowing the precise moment it all became irreversible.' Jellyfish, like the Japanese Sea Nettles seen in this file photo, beat their competitors for food and thrive in carbon-heavy environments .","With bacteria they can form 'carbon dioxide factories' and destroy oceans .

"(CNN) -- Progress against global diseases is typically slow, incremental and hard-won. But there are moments -- such as Wednesday's release of the World Health Organization's World Malaria Report -- when the cumulative effort of dozens of nations, millions of people and billions of dollars adds up to a true breakthrough. With the new report, we have turned a corner in the malaria fight. We have reduced the rate of deaths from malaria among children under 5 by 51% from 2000 to 2012 -- halfway to our goal of ending death by mosquito bite. For the first time, the number of children dying from this preventable and treatable disease fell below half a million. Progress against malaria is responsible for fully 20% of the reduction in child mortality since 2000. Malaria control has saved 3.3 million lives since 2000 -- 3 million of them children under 5. This progress stands out as one of the great success stories in global health, even in human history. It's especially impressive when you consider that malaria has been with us since the dawn of man and, by some accounts, has killed more people than any other cause in human history: more than war, famine or any other disease. Despite today's progress, malaria remains one of the biggest impediments to saving lives, improving health and unlocking human potential in much of the developing world. It threatens 3.4 billion people -- roughly half the globe -- and is a leading cause of school and work absenteeism in sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria literally sucks the lifeblood (energy, livelihood and productivity) from the African continent. I often compare the malaria fight to the moonshot. Both are human milestones, measures of our progress as a species and a society. And both were made possible by U.S. vision and leadership. The seeds of today's progress were sown under President George W. Bush with the launch of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in 2002 and the U.S. President's Malaria Initiative in 2005. These efforts have accelerated under President Barack Obama, who has expanded the initiative and recently committed to provide $1 to the Global Fund for every $2 contributed by the rest of the world, up to $5 billion by 2016. These investments are paying off, not only in children's lives saved but also in promoting stable, productive nations by keeping children in school, workers at their jobs and families financially secure. As former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently said, ""fighting malaria is not only the right thing to do, it's also the smart thing."" Much of the progress to date comes from expanded access to simple tools such as insecticide-treated mosquito nets, and we must maintain high levels of coverage. But how do we end the other 50% of child deaths? How do we ensure that no child dies from a mosquito bite and that we ultimately eradicate this disease from the planet? The answer comes down to three cheap, revolutionary tools. The first is a rapid diagnostic test, or RDT. Until a few years ago, there was no practical way to get a timely, accurate diagnosis for malaria. If someone thought they might have malaria, they had to travel to a distant clinic that had an expensive microscope -- and a trained lab technician who would examine a drop of blood under a microscope -- and hope the doctor read it right. Enter the RDT. This simple, 50-cent device tells you in a matter of minutes with 99% accuracy if you have the malaria parasite in your body. There are now 200 million of these tests deployed in Africa each year, and they're transforming the fight against malaria -- driving timely treatment and ensuring people who have other illnesses -- such as pneumonia or respiratory infection -- get the lifesaving care they need. The second tool is malaria treatment: artemisinin-based combination therapies, or ACTs. It costs less than $1 to deliver a full course of lifesaving treatment to a child in Africa. And the simple fact is: If a child with malaria gets this $1 worth of medicine in time, he or she will not die. At Malaria No More, we're helping to close the testing and treatment gaps in Africa through our new Power of One campaign, where every dollar provides a lifesaving test and treatment. The third tool may surprise you: a mobile phone. There's a mobile revolution under way in Africa. By 2015, there'll be more than 1 billion mobile phones on the continent. They're not only transforming communication and commerce but also how we fight communicable disease. Mobile is helping us solve a whole slew of problems in the malaria fight: address health facilities that have a shortage of lifesaving treatments by providing timely updates on stock levels, fight counterfeit drugs by enabling consumers to text a code to confirm a malaria treatment is authentic, expand the reach of health education to ensure people sleep under their mosquito nets and provide the real-time data on malaria cases that is the prerequisite for strategies to eliminate the disease. These tools are helping us work faster, smarter and more cost effectively. With their help -- and continued investment -- we can write malaria into the history books. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Martin Edlund.","Martin Edlund: New report finds impressive progress against malaria .

"By . Sophie Borland Health Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:40 EST, 10 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:31 EST, 11 December 2012 . Concerned: Care services minister Norman Lamb says there needs to be 'complete culture change' Care institutions where vulnerable patients are dumped for years on end will be shut down in the wake of the Winterbourne View scandal. Ministers want to end the practice of sending adults and children with learning disabilities to private hospitals and care homes that are often hundreds of miles from where they used to live. Instead, they want them to be looked after in their own homes or smaller residential centres nearby. The plans have been drawn up in the wake of the abuse of residents at Winterbourne View, a private hospital for adults with learning difficulties near Bristol. Last year a BBC Panorama documentary exposed how staff routinely tortured and abused vulnerable patients. The facility has since been closed and six staff jailed. Although the Government does not think abuse on this scale is widespread, there is concern that hundreds of patients are being poorly looked after in similar institutions. Many are sedated with high-dose drugs or forcefully held down if they become upset and aggressive. There are currently 1,200 adults and children with learning disabilities placed in what are known as assessment and treatment centres. But over the next two years the Government wants to reduce the number of patients to between 300 and 400, and to ensure that they only stay for a few weeks at a time. Instead, ministers want local councils and NHS bodies to enable patients to be looked after in their own homes or to be  housed in small, local, centres. Care services minister Norman Lamb said: ‘There has to be a complete culture change. Would we tolerate someone with cancer getting the wrong sort of treatment or wrong sort of care? ‘No, we wouldn’t, and yet for too long we have tolerated people with learning disabilities being put in the wrong settings. Scandal: A BBC Panorama documentary last year exposed abuse at Winterbourne View private hospital in Bristol . Abuse: The investigation exposed how vulnerable patients suffered terrible treatment . ‘They are living in large hospitals, completely inappropriately, where they are put under stress and strain, where their behaviour is inevitably affected.’ Many of these hospitals are privately owned and ministers fear they may be ‘profiting from others’ misery’. They want the owners and boards of directors at these firms to face prosecution if the hospital is found to be abusing or neglecting patients. Mr Lamb added: ‘When you look at Winterbourne View, the people who committed the abuse and the assaults were convicted, but what about the people making the money from that company?’ The Government has also instructed the Care Quality Commission watchdog to carry out unannounced inspections of these hospitals next year. Those found to be failing will be closed down and staff will face prosecution. And in June 2014, NHS organisations and councils will have to have drawn up a care-plan for each patient based on their needs. In most cases these will state they should be looked after in their own home or local residential centre. Organisations will have to provide a ‘justification’ whenever people continue to be housed in a hospital.","Ministers want more people with learning disabilities to be treated at home rather than private hospitals and care homes .

"Sri Lanka's police have arrested 37 nationals, turned back by Australian authorities on the high seas after attempting to seek asylum. Superintendent Ajith Rohana said Australia's coastguard intercepted the trawler carrying the Sri Lankans near the Indonesian coast, before handing the asylum-seekers over to Sri Lanka's navy on Thursday.

'Investigations are being conducted by the anti-people smuggling unit of the CID (Criminal Investigation Department),' Rohana said. 'They are being held in custody, but will be taken before a magistrate shortly.' The asylum-seekers are the first group to be turned back by the Australian Navy since July, when a boat with 41 Sri-Lankan nationals was intercepted west of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Sri Lanka has since charged them with illegally leaving the country and their cases are due to be taken up in court next May.

"The 34-year-old stars as a successful investment banker who has to rebuild his life after his wife is killed in a car crash.
Directed by French-Canadian Jean-Marc Vallee, the tragicomedy also stars Naomi Watts, Chris Cooper and newcomer Judah Lewis.
Almost 400 films will be screened at the festival over the next 11 days.
Introducing the world premiere of Demolition on stage, Vallee said his latest project was ""probably the most rock 'n' roll film I've ever made"".
""I think we can set the tone of this festival with the noise that we make tonight,"" he said.
The director praised Gyllenhaal's performance in the film, saying: ""There's nothing he hasn't done or tried.
""You'll see him dance, you'll see him sing - he went everywhere, surprising me all the time.""
Demolition brings Vallee back to TIFF for a third consecutive year, following Dallas Buyers Club - which earned Matthew McConaughey an Oscar - and last year's Wild, which saw Reese Witherspoon nominated for the best actress Academy award.
""You seem to love the films that I make - I want to come back again,"" Vallee joked.
Also receiving its world premiere on Thursday was Michael Moore's first film in six years, Where to Invade Next.
A satire of US military power, the controversial director made the film in secret and it was not known he had made it until it was announced on TIFF's programme.
Traditionally seen as the start of awards season - with film companies keen to kick-off their Oscar campaigns at the festival - TIFF will culminate with its own awards ceremony.
In past years, 12 Years a Slave, The King's Speech, Slumdog Millionaire and American Beauty have won the top People's Choice Award before going on to win the best picture Oscar.

FR8347 had been due to take off at 8.25pm last Friday but when the . passengers checked in for the two-hour 20 minute flight, they were told . there were delays because of adverse weather.

That . was when their real ordeal began. Passenger João Pinheiro posted a . video diary of the scenes on You Tube, which has since received nearly . 500,000 views. In the . video, passengers can be seen begging the cabin crew for assistance. ‘There is nothing to eat or drink,’ one man shouts to a male steward. ‘You are ignoring your passengers who are asking for help. Aren’t you . flight attendants? Is everybody crazy?’ A . woman passenger says: ‘You won’t let us eat or drink even if we pay? We . can’t leave the aircraft either?’ Another pleads: ‘There is a baby on . board.’ The video claims the passengers asked for food, water and for . the air conditioning to be turned on at 1am, but that this was refused. A . police car with flashing lights can be seen outside the aircraft before . an officer boards and tells passengers they will be allowed to  leave . the plane. After the video . emerged, Ryanair issued an apology but claimed that passengers had been . given water on the plane and said the captain had also called the police . for assistance. Last . night a spokesman for Swissport said: ‘Swissport staff were under . extreme pressure dealing with an unprecedented level of flights and . whilst we accept we should have unloaded the passengers sooner we simply . had no one available to unload when contacted by the captain. Swissport . regret any delay to passengers and to Ryanair.’ A Ryanair spokesman said “due to strong winds across the South of England (14 Feb) over 20 other airlines' aircraft were forced to divert into Stansted from Heathrow Airport, and this significantly impacted operations at Stansted. This Ryanair flight from London Stansted to Porto was delayed due to this and was then further delayed due to a fuelling issue at the airport. Passengers on this flight were disembarked and provided with refreshment vouchers. The aircraft departed the following morning at 7.50am. Ryanair sincerely apologised to all passengers affected by these adverse weather delays, which were outside of our control.

Loudmouth Ryanair businessman Michael O'Leary promised to 'stop unnecessarily p****** passengers off' after profits slumped last year. His budget airline are famed for charging low fares but bringing in extra revenue by hitting flyers with extortionate charges to put a bag in the hold.

In one incident, Spanish police hauled a woman off a plane in Valencia, Spain, before it took off because she had the 'wrong type of hand luggage'. Spanish newspapers said she was judged to have broken the airline’s rule of boarding with only a small package because she was carrying a scroll, which would not fit in her case, and a book. Footage of the incident in 2012 shows the Spanish woman begging to be let on board . as other passengers shout 'shameful, shameful'. Last month, furious French Ryanair passengers launched a revolt and stole from the drink trolley after being faced with 24-hour delay following an emergency landing. Their plane to Paris took off from Rabat, in Morocco, before being forced to land in Madrid because of a medical emergency. It was too late for the flight to land in Paris because of night restrictions by the time it took off again - so the plane stopped in Nantes instead. Passengers were put on a bus to their destination the next day. In May last year, a Ryanair flight was diverted 200 miles to another airport away from its Greek holiday island destination because the pilot said it was 'too dark to land'. The flight from London Stansted to Kefalonia landed at Thessaloniki airport on the Greece mainland instead as a result of the problems. Eventually it flew on to its destination after a two-hour delay.","Passengers called police after being sat on the plane for three hours .
Ryanair said they couldn't let them into the terminal because it was locked .
The airline said the captain also called police for assistance getting the passengers back into the building .
They were finally allowed off at 3.45am - but had to board the flight again two hours later when they faced another two hour delay .
Ryanair flight from Stansted to Porto was supposed to take off at 8.30pm .
However, it eventually took off at around 8am the following morning .
Incident happened after loudmouth businessman Michael O'Leary pledged to clean up the airline's act and 'stop p****** people off unnecessarily'"
"There was never any question over what Claire Rumble would call her daughter when she was born last month. It was always going to be Rosie, the name of the specialist nurse who looked after her big brother Louis during his three-and-half year battle with leukaemia. 'Deciding on the name was easy,' explains Claire. 'My husband James and I have never met anyone like Rosie — it was a tiny gesture of thanks for everything she’s done.' Three months earlier, five-year-old Louis had finally finished his treatment and was declared cancer-free. Heroic: Nurse Rosie Chisnell (right) has been nominated for a Health Hero Award by Claire Rumble (left) But it was the empathy and the many extra hours Rosie Chisnell put in helping the anxious family along their journey that has earned her a nomination for the Daily Mail Health Hero award. 'Other nurses clock in and off, Rosie is a constant. There’s no one else like her,' says Claire, a 34-year-old accountant. The family, who live in Hemel Hempstead, in Hertfordshire, first met Rosie in September 2009,  after a terrifying five days when Louis became suddenly and desperately ill. 'One day he was fine, playing with his twin sister Grace, then suddenly he stopped eating, was pale, exhausted and crying through the night for no apparent reason,' recalls Claire. 'When angry purple bruises appeared all over his body we rushed him to hospital.'' Just 12 hours after a barrage of tests at Watford General Hospital doctors revealed the shocking diagnosis: the 19-month-old had leukaemia. 'You can’t imagine  what being told your son has cancer feels like,' says Claire. 'The world just stops.' As the hospital’s paediatric oncology nurse, Rosie, 56, was there at the diagnosis. 'For the next two hours Rosie sat with us explaining everything in great depth, fielding our questions and laying everything out clearly and honestly. 'I remember asking her whether Louis was going to die and she said: ""His condition is fully treatable."" She couldn’t say no, but she has a natural way of reassuring you. It wasn’t until later that I realised her shift had actually finished at 5pm, six hours earlier. She’d stayed to help us.' It was just the first of many such gestures that demonstrated Rosie’s extraordinary dedication to her young patients. 'Rosie would often call us at 9pm, hours after she should have left, with Louis’s blood results. We’d say: ""What are you doing, go home,"" but she’d just laugh and say  she had a list of patients she needed to call.' Tragic: Cancer takes a particularly grim toll on children who find chemotherapy extremely hard . Support: Sick children, such as this little girl at Great Ormond Street hospital, need extra care . From day one the Rumble family had her mobile number. 'Children aren’t ill nine to five, Monday to Friday,' explains Rosie. 'I would hate to think something might happen and a family couldn’t get hold of me.' Claire and James, a 37-year-old aircraft engineer, frequently had to call Rosie late at night when Louis developed croup — a fierce barking cough — because of his weak immune system. 'I’d be beside myself, worrying whether he needed to be rushed into hospital or not. Knowing she was there, a phone call away, was a huge emotional support and stopped me flying into a blind panic.' Once Louis accidentally pulled out his nasogastric tube — a tube inserted via the nose into the stomach to administer medication. Unfortunately, it was on a weekend when Rosie wasn’t working, but she knew putting it back would be a traumatic experience for a child, so dropped everything and drove the 40 minutes from home to the hospital to do the procedure herself. 'I just couldn’t believe it. You don’t expect a nurse to do things like that, especially on their weekend off,' says Claire. 'We knew we had someone special in our corner.' In February 2010, Louis developed an infection which meant he had to go to hospital twice a day for antibiotic treatment until it cleared. For a child so young, it was a horrible experience: 'I’d lift him, asleep, from his cot and he’d start crying pleading: ‘No go, Mummy, no go.’ It was heart breaking.' The next day Rosie called to say not to take Louis to hospital as she was coming to their house with the equipment to teach Claire how to administer the intravenous antibiotics at home. 'I couldn’t believe anyone could be so kind. She arrived with a great crate of equipment and stayed until almost midnight, showing me exactly how it all worked; the pump, the syringes, everything. 'Louis’s face lights up when he sees her and when he was in hospital if he heard her heels click-clacking down the corridor he would sit up in bed. 'She’d chase him around the ward on hands and knees, despite her dress and heels (she doesn’t ‘do’ trousers) and treat him with such care and affection, explaining everything so he wouldn’t be scared. Health Hero: Do you know any heroic healthcare workers who deserve an award? Make your nomination below . 'Postman Pat would always be put on the TV when she was taking blood samples and she’d administer a bowl of Cheerios, another favourite, if he wasn’t eating. 'Whatever Rosie said, Louis would do. Grace, as his twin, could have felt left out but Rosie included her in everything, even letting her occasionally stay overnight in hospital with him as a sleepover. 'For a parent, you can’t underestimate the impact of having someone like Rosie around. I’d have spent days stewing over Louis’s health, endlessly worrying, but Rosie being just a phone call away meant I was less anxious and felt more in control. She helped me and James to focus on the practicalities of his treatment and be better parents.' So what drives this kind of dedication? 'It’s the children,' Rosie explains. 'They’re a model to us all. They just get on with it, the good and the bad. If I can improve their lives, or their families, even a bit, I’m happy. 'I know in this job I can make a difference. I’ve always loved children and got on with them easily and even as a little girl knew I wanted to be a nurse.' Rosie, who is married to Ian, a solicitor, never had children of her own, a conscious decision because of her career. 'Ian and I both work very hard. I’ve trained and worked in healthcare, specialising in paediatrics since I was 19. I have a wonderful niece, two nephews and lots of children at the hospital to keep  me busy.' Rosie is adamant that she wouldn’t be able to provide such high standards of care without the help of her colleagues. 'I couldn’t be nearly so flexible without a strong team behind me.' One member of that team is Vasanta Nanduri, a consultant paediatric oncologist who has worked with Rosie for the last 18 years. She says: 'She’s my right hand, a great friend with far too much energy and someone I trust implicitly. 'But it’s her knowledge and dedication to the children which is so impressive. She works out of hours, late into the night. She rarely takes a holiday, even though we try to make her. If she does, she writes 50-page handover notes. She’s a real inspiration. Everyone on the ward looks up to her.' Sentiments echoed by Claire. 'It will be a sad day when Rosie retires and I feel sorry for the families who won’t get to meet her. We felt lucky every day that she was around and now we’ll always be reminded of her kindness by baby Rosie.' For more information go to childrenwithcancer.org.uk . Do you know a health hero?

"Matthew Tvrdon, 33, was psychotic and hallucinating when he went on a ""journey of mayhem"" on 19 October 2012, at five locations.
He had stopped taking his medication, Health Inspectorate Wales (HIW) said.
It identified shortcomings in his care and a lack of monitoring of his condition leading up to the tragedy.
Karina Menzies, 32, from the Ely area, was struck while walking with two of her children outside Ely fire station. She pushed them out of the way before the van driven by Tvrdon hit her.
Tvrdon, who was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, later admitted her manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
He also pleaded guilty to seven counts of attempted murder and other charges including three counts of grievous bodily harm with intent during the incident which took place over eight miles of the city as parents were on the school run.
He told police on arrest he had targeted his victims because he mistakenly believed they had previously ""gaslighted"" him - a form of mental abuse that causes victims to doubt their own memory, perception and sanity.
On Thursday a report by HIW said that given the circumstances, it was difficult to see how Ms Menzies' death could have been prevented and it could not have been predicted.
The review said Tvrdon came from a stable and ""very caring"" family from Roath in Cardiff and only developed behavioural concerns while at university in 2002. He was forced to drop out and in 2003 was sectioned at Whitchurch Hospital, Cardiff.
It said he was psychotic and was under the care of Cardiff and Vale University Health Board from 2003 until 2012.
During that time he was sectioned in hospital four time, the final time in 2007, but he had never made any threats against members of the public.
The report said Tvrdon appeared to be ""well and in the phase of recovery"" and was working full time at Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) when he was seen for what was to be the final time by a consultant psychiatrist in October 2011 - a year before the tragedy.
He was advised to continue to take his medication for another year before gradually cutting it down until he stopped.
But it later emerged Tvrdon had stopped taking his medication almost immediately and had not been seen by any mental health services in the year before he went on the rampage in Cardiff.
The report said he had a history of not taking his medication and was reluctant to work with mental health services because he felt there was the stigma attached to it.
It said that when he did take his medication, he responded well and was able to have normal relationships and a job - but a relapse was likely if he stopped.
However, the severity of his condition was not properly communicated with his GP surgery, the report found.
It said mental health teams and GPs did not monitor Tvrdon's condition fully, particularly after he was sectioned and subsequently discharged in 2007, adding that there was no system in place to establish whether his prescriptions had been collected.
The report also highlighted the excessive workload of his consultant psychiatrist, who had responsibility for 300 patients, and said Tvrdon had been seen by nine GPs during his time under mental health services.
It made eight recommendations, including:
Despite the report's conclusion, Ms Menzies' sister Samantha said she believed more could have been done to prevent the incident.
She said the family and Tvrdon were let down by mental health services who should have done more to manage his condition.
""The report shows the consistency between him not taking medication and him relapsing,"" she said.
""If this was monitored I truly believe that he wouldn't have done it.""
The agencies involved have accepted the report's recommendations.
Adam Cairns, chief executive of the health board, said: ""While the review has acknowledged that it was difficult to see how this tragedy could have been prevented we do accept that, with hindsight, there were things that all agencies involved could have done better.""","A series of hit-and-runs in Cardiff which killed a mother and injured 20 others would have been difficult to prevent, a report finds."
"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama got a second term from voters and another chance with Chief Justice John Roberts. After flubbing the oath in 2009, Obama and the Supreme Court's top jurist performed the honor flawlessly at the White House on Sunday at the official swearing in for the Democrat's second term. They will do it again on Monday at the Capitol before a crowd of up to 800,000 people. The Constitution mandates that U.S. presidents be sworn in on January 20. Because that fell on a Sunday this year, the public ceremony was scheduled for Monday at noon. Inauguration 2013: A viewer's guide . The dual events this time were due to a confluence of law and pomp. That was not the case four years ago when Obama and Roberts also performed the honor twice. During that inaugural, Obama and Roberts fumbled the oath before 1.8 million people. It all started when Roberts recited a seven-word phrase, but Obama broke in halfway through and repeated the first three words. That seemed to throw Roberts off, and he proceeded to mix up the order of the words in the next phrase. CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin reported in his recent book, ""The Oath,"" that Roberts is known for his ""superb memory"" and had obsessively practiced reciting the words at home for weeks. Government sources told CNN and Toobin that Roberts and his staff also e-mailed their own copy of the oath to inauguration organizers weeks earlier. 13 reasons to follow the inauguration on CNN's platforms and nowhere else . Slash marks were clearly indicated to illustrate how the phrases would be divided and where Roberts would pause, to ensure the president-elect would be on the same page. No one is sure why it happened, but ""the oath card never reached anyone on Barack Obama's staff,"" Toobin wrote. They were concerned enough about the small stumble in the sequencing of words on the inaugural platform that Obama and Roberts went through it again the next day in private in the White House Map Room - just to make sure they were square with the Constitution. Back at the White House four years later, it all went off without a glitch just before noon on Sunday. With Roberts waiting in the Blue Room, Obama strode in before a small gathering. He placed his left hand on a Bible belonging to his wife's family and raised his right hand. Roberts had the card with him and the slash marks identifying where he would pause were clearly visible. It all took less than a minute to get through the 35-word oath. Obama hugged his wife and daughters, exclaiming: ""I did it!""

"England’s Golden Generation could get another chance to win the World Cup, but they will have to do it in the blistering heat of Qatar in 2016.

"The Australian said he can ""feel"" the ""long-seated rivalry"" towards England as they prepare to face Ireland at Twickenham on Saturday (16:50 GMT).
It is Jones' first home match after away wins over Scotland and Italy.
""Maybe Clive Woodward summed it up best when he said everyone hates England - that's true,"" Jones said.
""I'm not going to use it, but within the side they can use it. As I said when I took over, I'm not English, I'm Australian, but I will be absolutely committed to them.""
Jones revealed he sees Leicester centre Manu Tuilagi's future for England in the 12 shirt - once he is fully back to match fitness as he continues his return for Tigers after long-term injury.
""I think inside centre is his best position. He's not a 13. That's what I know he's not. He's definitely a 12. He can carry the ball across the gain line,"" Jones said.
""He threw a beautiful left to right pass on Friday night. And then he threw a terrible right to left, so maybe he's left handed!
""He's got all the attributes to be an outstanding 12.""
England are level with France at the top of the Six Nations table, ahead on points difference with both sides on six points after two games.
Jones continued to insist his side was a ""work in progress"", but praised his players for ""commitment"", ""taking initiative"" and ""being independent"".
And he is preparing England for an aerial bombardment from two-time defending champions Ireland, adding: ""They kick 70% of their ball away. If they want to do that, good luck to them.
""It has worked for them. It is not the way I think you should play rugby but it has been successful for them, so good luck.""","England can use the ""hatred"" from their Six Nations rivals as an extra motivating factor, says head coach Eddie Jones."
"(CNN) -- It's time to end the posturing and give the world's boxing fans the bout they desperately want: Manny Pacquiao versus Floyd Mayweather. That's Bob Arum's message to everyone involved in trying to navigate a way through the quagmire that is negotiations for a contest that has long been top of fight fans' wish list. Pacquiao's promoter has been in touch with Mayweather's camp to kick-start talks and finally attempt to get two of boxing's best ever fighters in the ring. Though both boxers are arguably past their prime any match up between Mayweather -- unbeaten in 45 fights across five different weights -- and Pacquiao -- an eight-division world champion with 55 wins from 62 fights -- is likely to ignite huge interest. ""We've put out the olive branch saying we would welcome the start of discussions for such a fight,"" Top Rank chief executive officer Arum told CNN World Sport. ""While Manny fights on HBO and HBO pay-per-view and Floyd fights on Showtime and Showtime pay-per-view, there is a precedent for both networks to come together and put on big event. ""They did it when heavyweight Mike Tyson, who was a Showtime fighter, fought Lennox Lewis, who was an HBO fighter, a number of years ago. That was a hugely successful event and set a record for pay-per-view sales in the US. ""We can't keep posturing,. If people want to make a deal and put aside egos and making statements to the press -- who was right, who was wrong -- and really sincerely want something to happen it generally gets done. ""And it is my hope that's what will happen; when and if both sides sit down to discuss seriously an event the sports world is crying out for."" With Mayweather approaching 37 and Pacquiao, 34, suffering two successive defeats before his most recent victory -- over Brandon Rios in Macau -- Arum acknowledges time is running out to make a deal. While the pair may not be as the pinnacle of their careers as they were when the fight was mooted three years ago, Arum still believes it would generate worldwide interest and reportedly might bring in $100 million. ""I think if an event like that was made people would really flock to watch it,"" he added. ""I think it's very fair to say the clamor is not as fervent as it was a few years ago when they were both at the height of their careers but it's still an event the public are clamoring for, perhaps not as much as three years ago but we can't roll back the clock."" Pacquiao's most immediate focus in the aftermath of his victory over Rios earlier this month has been to defend himself amid accusations that he owes $50 million in unpaid taxes in his home country the Philippines. The 34-year-old's assets have been frozen, meaning he had to borrow money to help victims of Super Typhoon Haiyan that tore through the country. But Arum says the allegations amount to a ""political vendetta"" against Pacquiao, who is a member of congress in the Philippines, and will be ironed out shortly. ""The assessment is based on fights he had in the United States and in every one of those fights -- four fights in the two years in question -- we withheld 30% of the amounts we paid him and paid those amounts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),"" Arum explained. ""We supplied the Philippine tax authorities with the schedule of our payments and receipts from the IRS. For some unknown reason they are insisting the IRS send certification of the payments. ""Manny applied for those certifications a while ago and of course the IRS was bogged down partly because when the government was shut down they weren't working. There's been a hold up but I'm sure once those certifications arrive, it will all go away. ""He doesn't owe anything. Under the Philippine-U.S. tax treaty, he was taxed in the U.S. for income earned in the U.S., and he gets a dollar per dollar credit against his Philippine taxes. ""Once that credit it given to him they'll find there is no further tax liability in the Philippines. ""I think it's great for his image because it shows the nature of politics in the Philippines. Manny Pacquiao is a member of a coalition in the Philippines that is in political opposition to the president and it seems to me as a foreigner, that this is nothing more than a political vendetta."" Arum hailed Pacquiao's showdown with Rios in Macau, a province of China, as a triumph and said he is planning another event with three former Olympic gold medalists in February. Along with the emergence of fighters from Latin America and Eastern Europe, as well as the traditional boxing heartlands of the U.S. and the United Kingdom, Arum pointed to Asia as having huge potential. ""Is Asia an up and coming market for everything? Of course it is,"" he said. ""There's 1.3 billion people in China, there's fans all over Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia. There's tremendous interest in boxing and we expect to do many events in the years to come in Asia. ""There will be a lot of talent in Asian fighters just as there are so many great fighters now coming out of Eastern Europe, from Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. ""Boxing is a world wide sport and our best fighters and champions are coming from all over. I'm very, very excited as far as the future of boxing is concerned.""","Boxing promoter Bob Arum says it is time to make Manny Pacquiao v Floyd Mayweather happen .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan for the Daily Mail . Celtic have landed a £212,000 Champions League bonus — after UEFA hammered Manchester City for breaching financial fair play rules. England’s champions were fined £50million for the FFP breaches but will only pay £20million provided they comply with break-even rules in future. Paris St Germain and Zenit St Petersburg were amongst nine clubs fined and the 70 clubs who reached the Champions League and Europa League group stages will each receive Euros 265,000 (£212,000) from the penalties.

Similar sums will be distributed to clubs who comply with the FFP rules in this season’s European competitions – meaning Celtic will double their money next season after reaching the Europa League group stage. The deal was hammered out in talks between the European Clubs’ Association and UEFA with ECA chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge saying: ‘It was an agreement between UEFA and the clubs that it was money belonging to the clubs.’ UEFA president Michel Platini addressed the ECA conference in Geneva attended by Celtic, Rangers and Motherwell and reiterated his commitment to FFP saying: ‘We will see whether any imperfections can be ironed out and whether there is room to further improve the system.’ Parkhead chief executive Peter Lawwell also lifted an ECA best achievement in marketing award after Celtic installed state of the art wifi last season.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:01 EST, 14 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 22:01 EST, 14 February 2014 . As fans of political thriller 'House of Cards' settled in to watch season two's premiere tonight, real-life politicians were rehearsing their lines. Now This News recruited members of Congress to deliver lines originally spoken by power-hungry character Francis J. Underwood, played by Oscar winner Kevin Spacey, in the hit Netflix series. But if you thought chilling comments uttered by a malicious - but fictional - character were unsettling, just wait until you hear them repeated by people with real power. Scroll down for video . Brutal: Kevin Spacey plays the cut-throat politician Frank Underwood in hit Netflix series 'House of Cards' The popular program charts the Democratic congressman and House Majority Whip's highly intricate plan to disgrace his enemies and obtain a cabinet position after the President goes back on his promise to appoint him Secretary of State. Underwood's vengeful plotting and deep-rooted corruption has attracted the ire of some politicians - and the adoration of others. This News producer Ashley Codianni targeted six political representatives - three Democrat and three Republican - who are fans of the show to deliver some of Underwood's most memorable quotes. But, she told USA Today, it wasn't easy: 'It was particularly difficult to get members to participate.' Majority Whip, Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), opens the clip with the poignant: 'I never make such big decisions so long after sunset and so far from dawn.' Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn (D-SC) means business when he says, 'I have no patience for useless things,' while Trey Gowdy (D-SC) gets into character with a sharp, 'I have zero tolerance for betrayal.' Cold-hearted: Rep Jeff Duncan (R-SC) nails Underwood's comment to his chief of staff, Doug Stamper, 'That's how you devour a whale, Doug, one bite at a time' Quiet achiever: Underwood's chief of staff Doug Stamper (pictured), played by Michael Kelly, is a vital cog in his boss's malicious machine . Majority Whip: Just like Underwood, who speaks directly to the camera, Rep Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) puts his call on hold to say, 'I never make such big decisions so long after sunset and so far from dawn' The lines get increasingly chilling, including Donna Edwards' (D-Md.) deadpan, 'Power is a lot like real estate. Location, location, location.' Repeating a line Underwood originally directed to his chief of staff, Doug Stamper, politician Jeff Duncan (R-SC) quotes: 'That's how you devour a whale, Doug, one bite at a time.' And to end, Sen Tim Scott (R-SC) repeats this doozy, initially directed to White House chief of staff Linda Vasquez: 'The nature of promises, Linda, is that they are immune, IMMUNE, to changing circumstances.' The plot: 'House of Cards' documents Frank Underwood's fury at being betrayed by President Garrett Walker and how, with his equally malicious wife, Claire, seek to exact revenge and ultimately gain power . Tough: Sen Tim Scott (R-SC) (left) repeats one of Underwood's most scathing lines to White House Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez (right), 'The nature of promises, Linda, is that they are immune, IMMUNE, to changing circumstances' Direct: Adopting the typical Underwood stance, Rep Trey Gowdy (D-SC) declares, 'I have zero tolerance for betrayal' Participating: Channeling Democrat representative Frank Underwood, real-life Democrats Jim Clyburn (left) and Donna Edwards (right) repeated some of his killer lines with aplomb . Meanwhile, Spacey said he's heard from politicians that his portrayal of Underwood is relatively accurate. 'I've had politicians say it's very accurate, probably closer to the truth. I've had others say it's cynical and unrealistic. It depends on your perspective,' he told USA Today. 'I was surprised that Kevin McCarthy said publicly something he said to me privately: 'If I could just kill one member of Congress, I'd never have to worry about another vote'.'

"Paramedics treated about 12,000 people who were so drunk it was noted on Scottish Ambulance Service systems in the six months to the end of September.
The figures were obtained by the Scottish Conservatives under freedom of information laws.
The ambulance service said alcohol had a significant impact on its operations.
It comes after a recent internal Scottish Ambulance Service survey showed alcohol was a factor in more than half of all call-outs ambulance staff dealt with at weekends.
The latest figures showed Scotland's largest health board, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, had the highest number of alcohol-related 999 call-outs in the six month period at 3,849. It was followed by NHS Lothian, with 1,935, and NHS Lanarkshire, with 1,470.
Tory health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said the statistics highlighted how ""deep-rooted and complex"" a problem alcohol is in Scottish society.
He said: ""Not only is it harming those who are over-consuming, but it is diverting scarce resources away from those whose need was not so avoidable.
""Of course the Scottish government and NHS can always do more to discourage reckless patterns of drinking and provide more help for paramedics who have to repeatedly go into these challenging situations - often several times each shift.
""But ultimately this is a case of personal responsibility, and that's where the real change has to come from.""
A Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said its teams had to respond to an increase in demand over the festive period, which was largely driven by alcohol.
He added: ""They are highly trained professionals who are frustrated by the amount of time they spend looking after patients who are simply intoxicated.
""Our staff should not have to fear for their own safety when responding to patients but alcohol is often a key factor in assaults.
""Assaults or threatening behaviour are reported to the police and support and counselling services are available to staff.""
Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said a recent four nations report found that Scotland was leading the way in the UK in taking action to tackle alcohol misuse.
She added: ""However, the harmful effects of excessive alcohol consumption puts additional pressure on these services, and this is another reason why everyone should drink responsibly and keep safe.""",Ambulances attend more than 60 incidents on average every day where a patient is so drunk that it has to be formally noted by crews.
"Longtime Fox News contributor and fill-in host Laura Ingraham is in line for her own show on the channel, possibly in a key prime time hour. 
  
 On Monday a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN that there are talks underway between Ingraham and Fox executives, but no decisions have been finalized. 
  
 The addition of an Ingraham talk show could be part of a bigger-picture reshuffling of Fox News Channel's highly rated schedule. 
  
 A Fox spokeswoman declined to comment and Ingraham did not respond to a request for comment. 
  
 Ingraham has been a paid contributor to Fox News since 2007. The show that's been discussed would be a big promotion. 
  
 Matt Drudge, who is well-sourced in conservative media circles, spurred intrigue about potential changes when he tweeted this on Monday: ""FALL PREVIEW: Laura Ingraham's prime time to shine! After years in the trenches, much deserved."" 
  
 Drudge got tongues wagging, which may have been his goal. 
  
 The prime time hours on cable news are 8, 9 and 10 p.m. When Megyn Kelly left for NBC in January, Tucker Carlson took over her 9 p.m. time slot. 
  
 Then in April when Bill O'Reilly was removed amid a sexual harassment scandal, Carlson moved into O'Reilly's 8 p.m. time slot and the channel's 5 p.m. conservative talk show ""The Five"" moved to 9 p.m. Sean Hannity remained in place at 10 p.m. 
  
 Now there is speculation inside and outside Fox that another schedule shake-up is in the works. 
  
 The cable news channel seems to be exploring programming options in the event that Eric Bolling does not return. Bolling is the centerpiece of the 5 p.m. show that was created when ""The Five"" moved to 9. It is called ""Fox News Specialists."" 
  
 Earlier this month Bolling was suspended pending a probe into accusations that he sent lewd texts to colleagues, which he has denied. 
  
 If Fox News executives need to replace ""The Specialists,"" ""The Five"" could be shifted back to its original 5 p.m. time slot. Then Ingraham could take over at 9 p.m. 
  
 Alternatively, Hannity could move up one hour to 9, and Ingraham could take over at 10. 
  
 Or maybe Fox executives have something in mind that nobody else has thought of yet. 
  
 Along with the Bolling suspension, another subplot is the ratings race between Fox and MSNBC. The MSNBC host Rachel Maddow has snapped Fox's winning streak in the 9 p.m. hour. 
  
 So Fox executives are asking themselves: Would Ingraham be a better match against Maddow than ""The Five"" currently is? 
  
 Ingraham is a vocal supporter of President Trump, just like some of the co-hosts of ""The Five."" 
  
 She is already a popular radio talk show host, with a three-hour morning time slot on stations across the country. She also operates a conservative-themed news and features site called LifeZette. ||||| Fox News Channel is in discussions with the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham that could result in her coming to the 21st Century Fox-owned cable-news network as a regular host, a person familiar with the outlet’s plans confirmed early Tuesday. 
  
 The two sides are believed to be in early talks, and no decision has been made regarding the time slot Ingraham might anchor, or even when she might join the company in the new role. No deal has been signed, and there is no sense at this time when one might come to fruition, this person said. She already serves as a Fox News contributor. 
  
 Revelation of the talks, which surfaced Monday on The Drudge Report and were further detailed by CNN, show Fox News Channel continuing to mull tinkering with its program line-up as it grapples in real time to find alternatives for hosts who have come under recent fire. Fox News replaced mainstay Bill O’Reilly in April after he parted ways over advertiser reaction to disclosures of settlements paid to women who had accused him of sexual harassment and other improprieties. 
  
 The network’s current primetime lineup features Tucker Carlson at 8 p.m, the panel show “The Five” at 9 p.m., and Sean Hannity at 10 p.m. And though Fox News remains cable’s most-watched news network, it has had to contend with a resurgent MSNBC, where a primetime lineup led by Rachel Maddow has expanded its audience. 
  
 Related Fox, Major League Baseball Strike New Rights Pact Official Name of New Fox Is, Uh, Fox -- and Other Takeaways From Annual Stockholders Meeting 
  
 Ingraham has a long association with Fox News, having served as a fill-in for both Hannity and O’Reilly. Executives at the network have remained open to the idea of tweaking its primetime lineup, Fox News co-president Jack Abernethy told Variety in July. 
  
 Fox News is also mulling talent options due to the recent suspension of Eric Bolling, the former commodities trader who served as co-host on the late-afternoon program “Fox News Specialists,” this person confirmed. Bolling was suspended earlier this month, when Fox News said it planned to investigate recent allegations made in a Huffington Post report that Bolling may have sexually harassed colleagues. Bolling has denied the charges and said he intends to clear his name. ||||| Fox News is not commenting, but people familiar with the talks who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly said Ingraham is seen as a compatible fit between the network's conservative prime-time hosts Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity. Under that scenario, the roundtable show ""The Five"" -- which moved to 9 p.m. Eastern time when the network had to shuffle its program line-up after Bill O'Reilly exited in April -- would move back to its original time slot of 5 p.m. Eastern to make room for Ingraham. |||||","– If sources are to be believed, Fox News could be headed toward its third major prime-time lineup shuffle this year. A ""source with knowledge of the matter"" tells CNN that Laura Ingraham is in talks with Fox executives to get her own show on the network. That report was confirmed to Variety by a ""person familiar with the outlet's plans."" Ingraham has been a contributor with Fox News since 2007 and has filled in for both Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly on occasion. Talks are said to be in their early stages, and nothing has been finalized. Neither Fox News nor Ingraham have commented. Fox News had to switch up its prime-time lineup earlier this year, first with the departure of Megyn Kelly and then again when O'Reilly was ousted amid sexual harassment allegations, the Los Angeles Times reports. Now, the networks is faced with the possibility of host Eric Bolling, also facing sexual harassment allegations, getting the boot, as well. That would create an opening for Ingraham, a strident supporter of President Trump who sources say could be a good fit between Hannity and Tucker Carlson. “She’s always been a go-to solution for Fox News,” one source says. Giving Ingraham her own show could also allow Fox News to move Hannity up an hour to compete directly with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow."

"Phillip Clayton claims his 86-year-old mother Maureen, a retired teacher, died in agony, covered in pressure sores, after nurses failed to turn her in her hospital bed for 11 weeks . An 86-year-old woman died covered in 'horrendous' pressure sores after nurses failed to turn her in her hospital bed, her son claims. Phillip Clayton said his mother died in 'pain and tears' and contracted MRSA as a result of the care she received. He claims a delay in fitting a pacemaker also contributed to his mother's death after she was admitted to hospital with a dangerously low heart rate. He has launched a complaint against Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent after his mother Maureen died in November. NICE guidelines advise adults at high risk should be turned at least once every four hours to prevent pressure ulcers. The hospital is now carrying out a review into her care. Mr Clayton, 56, a public sector worker, said: 'The fact that my mother died is unfortunate. 'The way she died in pain and tears from the pressure sores is a disgrace and in my view, totally unacceptable. 'It is wrong to say my mother would not have died but I do think the care she received shortened her life. 'It was not the right way for her to die. The way she spent her last few weeks was shocking. 'The real problem is a total lack of leadership which permeates right down to ward level and results in an appalling level of service. 'I do not need apologies or a formal investigation, what I would like to see is change.' Mrs Clayton, a retired teacher, was admitted to the hospital on September 13 after a fall at her home in Rainham, Kent. Her heart rate was low and she spent three days on a cardiac unit before being diagnosed with liver problems and transferred to the Will Adams ward. Mr Clayton claims while there staff failed to turn her during her entire 11 week stay - when it should have been done once every four hours. Mr Clayton says his mother even contracted MRSA as a result of the 'disgraceful' care she received at Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent (pictured) Mrs Clayton was admitted to the hospital on September 13 after a fall at her home in Rainham . He added that they only rearranged the pillows under her back which did not prevent her from contracting painful pressure sores. Three weeks into her stay she was diagnosed with MRSA and died on November 27 from renal failure. Mr Clayton added: 'They simply rearranged the pillows underneath her. Turning a patient in bed is not rocket science. It is a basic nursing skill. 'There was a long delay before she was fitted with a temporary pacemaker and then a permanent one. During this time she deteriorated. 'If she had been fitted with the pacemaker in the first week and been able to get up, maybe things would have been different.' A spokesperson from Medway NHS Foundation Trust, who run the hospital where Mrs Clayton was treated said: 'The Trust takes concerns around care very seriously and is currently carrying out a review, as discussed with the family. 'The outcome of the review and the actions we are taking as a result of the findings, will be shared with the family.'","Phillip Clayton says his mother Maureen died covered in pressure sores .

"(CNN) -- A deathbed photo of Gary Coleman appeared Wednesday on the cover of Globe Magazine, showing the actor's ex-wife staring into the camera next to the former child actor. The man named executor in Coleman's will accused Shannon Price of profiting from her ex-husband's death by selling the image to the tabloid, and suggested she is destined for the ""life of a social and professional outcast."" Coleman divorced Price in 2008, but they were living together in Santaquin, Utah, when he suffered a fall at home last month and died two days later of a brain hemorrhage in a Provo, Utah, hospital. Globe parent company American Media confirmed it bought the photo, but spokeswoman Samantha Trenk would not disclose how much was paid or who sold the image. A Utah judge appointed Dion Mial, Coleman's longtime friend and former manager, as special administrator of the estate while the will goes through the probate process. A will signed in 1999 named Mial as executor. Mial threatened to have Price, 24, arrested unless she returned property he said had been taken from Coleman's home since his death. She must also stay away from the Santaquin home where they lived together, Mial said. While Coleman was not believed wealthy when he died, his personal possessions may be valuable to collectors. ""These items include, but are not limited to, numerous televisions and video game systems, a black 2005 Dodge pick-up truck (registered to Coleman), cargo trailer (registered to Coleman), model train sets, computers, telephones, musical instruments, and furnishings,"" Mial said. ""It is our hope that Miss Price should immediately and respectfully comply with the court's order, so as to avoid the filing of criminal charges against her,"" Mial said. Mial was unable to stop the Globe from publishing the death images, which he accused Price of peddling to tabloids in an ""ongoing desperate attempt"" to profit from his death. ""These actions simply illuminate and magnify the truth that our gift of free will may, ultimately, relegate us to a long life of bondage and imprisonment that the life of a social and professional outcast, indeed, will bring,"" Mial said Wednesday. ""May God bless Miss Price and her 'free will.'"" A statement released by Price's publicist Monday did not deny Mial's accusation, but did say she needed money because she had helped Mial pay for a lawyer. ""Dion, who claims to be a good friend of Gary, would know that Gary's only wishes were to make sure that Shannon would be OK after he was gone,"" the statement said. ""So if Dion was a good friend he would be assisting Shannon, not taking all her money, to pay for his attorney and then use it to take everything from her.""","NEW: Coleman estate administrator says ex-wife will become ""outcast""

 Staffers Walk Out Of Congress In Protest Over Brown And Garner Cases

 Dozens of congressional staff members walked out of the Capitol at 3:30 p.m. ET Thursday, in a show of support for protesters angered by recent grand jury decisions not to indict police officers in the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. 
  
 Wearing suits, ties and overcoats, the staffers stood several rows deep on the steps of Capitol Hill before making the hands-up gesture that has come to symbolize frustration with the deaths of the two unarmed black men at the hands of police. They stood silently with their arms raised for a moment before disbanding and walking down the steps. 
  
 While the event was spearheaded by the Congressional Black Associates, it also drew other staff members, including the Congressional Asian Pacific American Staff Association and the Congressional Hispanic Staff Association, according to CNN. 
  
 A few members of Congress came out to the steps, including Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas. The short event included a prayer from U.S. Senate Chaplain Barry Black. 
  
 The protest comes a week after Rep. Marcia L. Fudge, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, said she was ""deeply disappointed"" by a Staten Island grand jury's decision not to level charges in the Garner case. 
  
 Noting that the decision was similar to another jury's findings in Ferguson, Mo., Fudge wrote: 
  
 ""In the span of two weeks, this nation seems to have heard one message loud and clear: there will be no accountability for taking Black lives. As an American, it is growing increasingly difficult to believe that there is justice for all."" ||||| Story highlights Congressional staffers are planning to walk off their jobs Thursday at 3:30 p.m. 
  
 Staffers said they are showing solidarity to communities affected by a decisions not to indict officers in killing unarmed black men 
  
 Congressional staffers plan to walk off their jobs Thursday afternoon to show their support for the families of Michael Brown and Eric Garner in the wake of the decision by two grand juries not to indict the police officers responsible for their deaths, according to three staffers who plan to participate in the event. 
  
 The planned walkout comes after days of protests across the country, including in Washington, D.C., where demonstrators have marched through downtown, blocking roads and bridges on an almost nightly basis since last Wednesday's decision by a grand jury in Staten Island not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the chokehold death of Garner. 
  
 ""We're proud to have this moment of solidarity with the families of Michael Brown and Eric Garner and the thousands of peaceful protesters around the country who are telling this country that black lives matter,"" said one staffer who was helping to plan the event. 
  
 The Congressional Asian Pacific American Staff Association and the Congressional Hispanic Staff Association joined black staffers and the Congressional Black Associates in planning the event, which is set to take place at 3:30 p.m., and is expected to draw at least 50 people. A staffer who planned to attend the protest said it was important to show support across racial lines. 
  
 ""I believe it's important, because what affects one community really affects the entire country,"" the staffer told CNN. ""It's not just one group of minorities that's affected. How one group is treated affects Asians, Hispanics, women. It's important that we show our solidarity and come together and really speak out about the injustices that are being done."" 
  
 The group will gather in front of the Capitol and plan to take a photo at 345 p.m. U.S. Senate Chaplain Barry Black is expected to pray for the grieving families and to pray for peace. 
  
 The US Capitol dome is cocooned in scaffolding on October 28, 2014 in Washington, DC as it undergoes its first comprehensive repairs in more than half a century a century. The two-year, USD 60 million project is aimed at repairing nearly 1,300 cracks that have emerged in the nine-million-pound (4.1-million-kilogram) cast iron dome, according to the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) office. Construction on the dome began in 1855. Work symbolically continued through the US Civil War and the structure was eventually completed in 1866. AFP Photo/Paul J. Richards (Photo credit should read ) 
  
 ""We're not trying to cause any type of controversy,"" one staffer told CNN. ""We're just trying to highlight this issue, to show solidarity with people who have been affected."" 
  
 Chaplain Black has drawn attention before for his topical prayers. Last year during the budget battle that shut down the government for 16 days, he opened each session with a prayer appealing the lawmakers to end the impasse. 
  
 ""Obviously, there are probably some people who feel that my prayers should not have been as pointed as they were,"" Black told CNN's Anderson Cooper after the shutdown had ended. ""My prayers simply reflect the reality of the environment that I am in."" 
  
 Black could not be reached immediately reached for comment ahead of the event. ||||| Over a hundred black congressional staffers and several black lawmakers staged a walkout at the Capitol this afternoon, leading a silent protest on the steps of the Capitol over the recent police killing involving Ferguson and Eric Garner. 
  
 Reps. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and Marc Veasey, D-Texas, were among the lawmakers participating in the walkout. Senate Chaplain Barry Black led the group in prayer, saying they were working as a “voice for the voiceless.” 
  
 “Today as people throughout the nation protest for justice in our lands, forgive us when we have failed to lift our voices for those who couldn't speak or breathe for themselves,” Black said. “May we not forget that in our national history injustice has often been maintained because good people failed to promptly act. Forgive oh God, our culpability in contributing to our national pathology as you keep us aware of our own capacity to be instruments of injustice.”

Helping hand: Zhou Bo went to the aid of a young boy left dangling from a fourth-storey window after getting his head stuck in a grid in Lingwu, Ningxia, China . Dangerous: Zhou Bo managed to prevent the boy from suffocating by holding him up by his feet while also balancing on stool perched on a window sill . He said: 'I went there, and saw a boy dangling in the air, as his head was stuck in between the window grid.' Zhou could see that the boy was suffocating as his feet had nothing to stand on. He dashed inside and raced up to the flat but found the door locked. He then went one floor below but discovered that the gap between that window and the dangling boy was too great. Zhou said: 'Without help, the boy would be suffocated soon, or he has the danger of dropping down'. So Zhou found a chair and balanced it precariously on the third-storey window ledge before standing on it and supporting the trapped boy's feet from underneath. 'I felt time froze, and my arms went numb but firemen still didn't arrive,' said Zhou. Finally, firefighters arrived 40 minutes later and were able to break into the apartment and pull the boy, who had been left home alone, to safety. Waiting game: Zhou Bo had to hold the position for 40 minutes until firefighters arrived at the scene .

"Like a wounded animal lashing out in fury, ISIS is betraying hints of desperation in its latest video, which purportedly shows the aftermath of the beheading of U.S. hostage Peter Kassig, analysts said Sunday. And if there's news worse than the apparent brutal death of Kassig, it's that we should expect even more vicious videos to come from the group, also known by the acronym ISIL, said Haras Rafiq of the Quiliam Foundation, an anti-extremist think tank. ""As we see the U.S. and the coalition making gains against ISIL, we will find that they try and show that they are still strong, try and show that they are just as barbaric as they have been, and unfortunately one of the things we'll see is that the videos will become more and more barbaric,"" he said. ""I think it's a sign of desperation,"" he said. ""I think it's a sign that they know and feel they are under attack, they're under siege and they're struggling."" The video, released online Sunday, shows the aftermath of a beheading, in which the victim is not clearly recognizable. The White House confirmed that the video showed Kassig. Kassig, 26, who converted to Islam in captivity, also went by the name Abdul-Rahman Kassig. He went to the Middle East as a U.S. soldier and returned as a medical worker, feeling compelled to help victims of war. The video does show -- in gruesome detail -- the beheadings of what the group claims are pilots for the Syrian government, which is also battling ISIS forces. ""It can't be said enough,"" said CNN's Nic Robertson. ""This is the most barbaric they've done so far."" The carefully produced video is clearly ""a prize piece of propaganda for them,"" Robertson says. It also differs from others produced by ISIS. It doesn't feature a Western hostage dressed in orange speaking to the camera before his death. Nor does it name the group's next victim. It is likely in part meant to scare Syrians and Iraqis into obeying ISIS' orders when it comes calling, said Rafiq and retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Joe Ruffini, a counterterrorism expert. ""What ISIS is telling them is, 'When we come in and tell you to do what we tell you, you know what the consequences are if you say no,'"" Ruffini said. But it also comes at a time when the United States and its anti-ISIS allies are claiming their airstrikes and support for ground forces fighting the group are beginning to slowly turn the tide, said retired U.S. Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks. Has ISIS peaked? Terror group suffers setbacks in Iraq . It also comes during a visit to Iraq by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey. ""Clearly there are no coincidences,"" Marks told CNN on Sunday. ""This is timed very specifically to those activities by the coalition and, I would say, the results of those activities."" Since beginning airstrikes in August, U.S. officials have touted successes in disrupting ISIS communications and logistics, slowing its advances and forcing fighters to disperse into smaller formations. Last week, President Barack Obama said the fight was entering a new phase that would rely heavily on Iraqi ground troops and other local fighters. More recently, U.S. officials have suggested more openness to a role for U.S. ground forces in the fight. In testimony to the House Armed Services Committee on Thursday, Dempsey said commanders are ""certainly considering"" the prospect that U.S. forces might be needed to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul, currently held by ISIS. In Sunday's video, the narrator taunted Obama to do just that. Hostages tortured before beheadings .","Video in part aimed at local residents, analysts say .

"(CNN)  -- A woman who said she had a mother-daughter relationship with slain model Jasmine Fiore told CNN's Larry King on Thursday night that Fiore never informed her that she had been married. An arrest warrant has been issued for Ryan Alexander Jenkins, wanted in the death of ex-wife Jasmine Fiore. Gwendolyn Beauregard said Fiore was a close friend of her two sons, and she met the future model when Fiore was just 11. Despite the close ties -- ""she called me mommy and she was my daughter"" -- Beauregard was in the dark about Fiore's marriage to Ryan Jenkins. The marriage reportedly was annulled a few weeks after their Las Vegas, Nevada, wedding. An arrest warrant for murder has been issued for Jenkins, a reality TV contestant. Authorities believe he's fled to Canada. Fiore's body was found Saturday, stuffed into a suitcase and left in a Dumpster in Buena Park, just outside Anaheim in Orange County, California. Interviewed from San Francisco, California, Beauregard told King all she knew about Jenkins was his initial meeting with Fiore. ""She didn't tell me that she married him. She told me [about] the day that they met, which was St. Patrick's Day,"" Beauregard said. ""She called me the day after and she said: 'Mommy, I met the most perfect guy in the world and -- and his name is Ryan.' And she just went on and on and on about Ryan and how perfect he was. And that was all I knew."" Beauregard told King she's never met Ryan Jenkins. Mike Fleeman, the West Coast editor of People.com, described more details of Fiore's whirlwind courtship with Jenkins to King. ""They met in Las Vegas. Two days later [in March], they got married at the Little White Wedding Chapel. That's, of course, where Britney Spears got married,"" Fleeman told King. ""It was a quickie wedding. We today talked to somebody who was at the wedding. One of the witnesses was an employee of the chapel. A lot of people were shocked that both of them were married. They kept it under wraps. And the marriage had a lot of problems almost from the very beginning,"" Fleeman said. Fleeman told King that Jenkins was arrested and charged with domestic assault against Fiore in Nevada in June and that Jenkins was supposed to go to trial in December. Beauregard told King that Fiore, who was 28 when she died, started modeling in her early 20s. Despite their deep bond, Beauregard said Fiore had ties with her biological mother, Lisa Lepore. ""She was close to her mother, as well, but it was a different type of closeness."" Adding to the horror of the slaying was that Fiore's teeth had been extracted and her fingers removed. Criminal profiler Pat Brown told Larry King that act provided key crucial evidence early in the investigation. ""It was very clear from the very beginning, when they found her body in a piece of luggage, that we weren't dealing with a serial killer. I knew it was somebody who knew her and [that her killer] wanted to make sure that she was not identified,"" Brown said. ""This is why he [the suspect[ ended up cutting off her fingers ... taking out her teeth. He even got smart. He watched too many crime shows and thought he would get rid of all ID, took away her clothes, put her in the luggage, probably because it's one way to get her of an apartment. And throw it a Dumpster and hope that time will take care of it, she'll decompose, they'll never be able to identify her,"" Brown said. Jenkins has appeared on VH1 shows ""Megan Wants a Millionaire"" and ""I Love Money 3."" ""This is a very arrogant man,"" Brown said. ""Megan said it right on the show. She said he's a manipulator. He is. He has evidence of psychopathy there."" The brutality of the crime has hit Fiore's circle of friends hard. ""Ryan Jenkins is an animal,"" said Robert Hasman, a family friend who said Fiore had been his girlfriend for 2 1/2 years.  Watch Hasman speak out » . ""What he has done to Jasmine is unspeakable. It's just not right."" He described her as ""a beautiful person who was a very caring individual."" Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said on ""Larry King Live"" that Jenkins is the only suspect. ""There is no indication that anybody else might be involved,"" he said. ""We believe he's armed because there's a handgun missing from his apartment, which is the last place he was before ... he fled. So it appears that he's armed. And he's certainly dangerous because he's desperate,"" Rackauckas said.","Gwendolyn Beauregard says she had mother-daughter relationship with slain model .

"The billionaire and reality TV star said Mr McCain was only considered a hero because he was a prisoner of war.
He then added: ""I like people who weren't captured.""
The comments prompted strong criticism across the party. Rival contender Rick Perry said the remarks were a ""new low"" in US politics.
Mr Trump later sought to clarify his remarks, although he did not apologise.
""If a person is captured, they're a hero as far as I'm concerned,"" he said. ""I don't like the job John McCain is doing in the Senate because he is not taking care of our veterans.''
The two have clashed before, with Mr McCain accusing Mr Trump of having ""fired up the crazies"" with his attacks on Mexican immigrants.
Mr McCain was held for five-and-a-half years after his plane was shot down in the Vietnam war. Mr Trump avoided service through student and medical deferments.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Nicola Benedetti, whose album Homecoming: A Scottish Fantasy has entered the top 20 of the UK Official Album chart . She became BBC Young Musician of the Year when she was 16, was named one of Britain’s most powerful young women earlier this year and already has an MBE and eight honorary degrees. But Nicola Benedetti has added yet another string to her bow. Yesterday she became the first solo British violinist since the 1990s to enter the Top 20 of the official UK albums chart with her record Homecoming: A Scottish Fantasy. She is also the first ever Scottish classical artist to enter the Top 20. It’s at number 19 and expected to rise. The last British violinist to score a Top 20 album as a solo performer was Vanessa Mae in 1995. Nigel Kennedy achieved the same feat in 1989. Miss Benedetti, who is due to perform at the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, said: ‘I am absolutely thrilled to have reached the Top 20, not something a classical artist ever expects. This is a deeply personal recording inspired by Bruch’s Scottish Fantasy. 'The project took me deep into the heart of Scottish culture. I hope the music, in all its diversity, is providing some uplift  and pleasure.’ Earlier this year the 26-year-old lashed out at critics who claim glamorous classical musicians succeed because of their sexy image rather than their artistic ability. She said it amounted to sexism when talented female artists were judged on their looks, adding: ‘Classical music can be prouder of its integrity than many industries. People are basically chosen for their ability.’ Miss Benedetti’s latest achievement follows her MBE in 2013 for her educational and charity work. She was named in Britain’s Top 30: The Young Female Power List, published in the Times in February, alongside the likes of Adele, Emma Watson and the Duchess of Cambridge. Miss Benedetti's latest achievement follows her MBE in 2013 for her educational and charity work . Her rendition of Scottish Fantasy, a piece of classical music written in 1880 by the German romantic composer Max Bruch, now sits in the mainstream chart alongside pop acts such as Will.i.am – a judge on BBC talent show The Voice. The number one spot was claimed by the rapper and producer. His new single has gone straight in at the top of the charts to give him his 10th UK number one. It’s My Birthday, featuring 17-year-old American singer Cody Wise, tops the pile 11 years after The Voice judge’s first number one, 2003’s Black Eyed Peas hit Where Is The Love, . He knocked reigning chart queens Ariana Grande and Iggy Azalea down to two with Problem, while Ella Henderson also slides one to number three with Ghost, according to the Official Chart Company. The pop star now has five solo number one singles in Britain, the same as he has with the Black Eyed Peas.","Nicola Benedetti's new record enters official UK album chart's top 20 .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Two Pakistani men accused of providing logistical support for last year's deadly terror attacks in Mumbai, India,  were arrested Saturday in Italy, police said. They were arrested in the northern Italian city of Brescia, said Stefano Fonzi, head of Italy's Division of General Investigations and Special Operations. The attacks on India's largest city lasted four days. The attackers targeted several sites in Mumbai, taking over several hotels and a Jewish center. The attacks left 160 people dead. On November 25, 2008, the day before the attacks in Mumbai, the two men arrested allegedly transferred $229 that was used to activate Internet phone lines used by the suspects. Two others connected with the longstanding money transfer agency in Brescia also were arrested for other illegal activity, Fonzi told CNN. Police are looking for a fifth man. Italian police started their investigation the following month after being alerted by Indian authorities and the FBI that funds had been transferred from Italy, Fonzi said. Authorities suspected the agency after money was transferred under the Muslim name of a man who had never entered Italy, a police statement said. Indian police have said 10 Pakistanis were involved in the deadly assault, nine of whom were killed in the carnage. The lone surviving suspect has linked the coordinated shooting and bombing incidents to the leader of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a militant group that is banned in India. CNN's Hada Messia in Rome contributed to this report.","Two men arrested in Italy in connection with November 2008 Mumbai, India, terror attacks .

"New Zealand scrum-half Shaun Johnson has capped a memorable 12 months by winning the 2014 Rugby League World Golden Boot - seeing off the challenge of union convert Sam Burgess for the honour. The New Zealand Warriors playmaker, who broke England's hearts with a last-minute try and conversion in the semi-finals of the 2013 World Cup, produced a man-of-the-match performance in the 2014 Four Nations Series final in Wellington last month as the Kiwis defeated Australia to lift the title - a performance that impressed the 13-man Golden Boot voting panel. For the second successive year, English forward Burgess - who swapped South Sydney for Bath in October - came second in the voting but, whereas 12 months ago Burgess was within seven points of Johnathan Thurston, this time Johnson was a decisive winner, collecting almost twice as many points as his nearest rival. Johnson becomes only the fourth New Zealander to win the prestigious award, following in the footsteps of Hugh McGahan, Stacey Jones and Benji Marshall. Shaun Johnson has capped a memorable 12 months by winning the 2014 Rugby League World Golden Boot . Johnson said: 'Being a rugby league fan growing up, I always knew about the Golden Boot award. 'I was pretty aware of the players who'd won it before because they were players that I grew up watching like Stacey Jones and Andrew Johns. Then there were the current players that I admire like Thurston. To receive it is pretty unreal to be honest. 'I felt I finished the year really well and was able to take that into the Four Nations and was really happy with how I played for the Kiwis. 'It was just made easy by the culture that we have there now and the group of players that we have around us. There's no way I could have received this award without those boys playing their part, and I'll accept it on their behalf.' The panel of 13 judges comprised representatives from Australia, England, France and New Zealand, including former Golden Boot winner Garry Schofield, ex-Great Britain coach Brian Noble and past Kiwi internationals Robbie Hunter-Paul and Daryl Halligan. On a six-man shortlist. Johnson claimed 44 points, Burgess 23, with James Graham third on 18 and Greg Inglis fourth with 17. Double winner Thurston - who missed the Four Nations through injury - polled 13 points and Kiwi prop Jesse Bromwich two. Johnson becomes only the fourth New Zealander to win the prestigious award, following in the footsteps of Hugh McGahan, Stacey Jones and Benji Marshall . 'As is always the case with the Rugby League World Golden Boot, we asked the judges to consider the performances on the international stage first and foremost, and it's undeniable that Shaun Johnson had the biggest impact at that level in 2014,' RLW editor Gareth Walker said. 'Throughout the entire tournament he provided a devastating mix of organising the New Zealand side and producing moments of individual brilliance himself.' The Kiwis' Four Nations triumph is reflected in the selection of a record number of players in the world team of the year - six. Dean Whare lines up at centre with Manu Vatuvei flanking him on the wing, with Johnson in the halves. Bromwich, Kevin Proctor and Simon Mannering pack down in the mythical side. Burgess is named at loose forward, with prop Graham and wing Ryan Hall England's other inclusions. The Australians are Inglis, Michael Jennings, Thurston and Cameron Smith.","Shaun Johnson saw off the challenge of union convert Sam Burgess .

"Authorities in Russia warned the FBI ‘multiple times’ about Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, though the ethnic Chechen could have slipped through the cracks because he was not linked to al Qaeda, it was revealed Tuesday by U.S. Senators who were briefed on the terrorist attacks. The federal agency looked into the eldest brother in 2011 after the Russian government contacted them, warning that Tamerlan Tsarnaev may have deveoped radical Islamic ties following a prolonged trip to Russia, including Muslim-predominant Dagestan. However, after its initial search and interviews with him and his family members, the FBI closed the case, and has come under intense scrutiny for doing so. Scroll down for video . Conflicting: Tamerlan Tsarnaev turned from an 'arrogant' sportsman to an increasingly radical Muslim. Studying the Koran alone in Dagestan; Russian authorities tried to alert the FBI over the 'bomber' multiple times, according to lawmakers . Speaking with the Boston Herald, a senator sitting in on Tuesday’s confidential meetings on Capitol Hill said that the FBI could have missed Tamerlan Tsarnaev’s radicalization as he didn’t share links to the terror network al Qaeda. That senator spoke on the condition of anonymity, as Tuesday’s briefings were classified. Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, told the Herald that the Russian government also had very different priorities. ‘Their concern was Chechen radicals. Our higher concern was al-Qaeda,’ he told the paper, explaining that the militant Islamist group was more dangerous to the U.S. in light of the 9/11 attacks.

"(CNN) -- A three-goal blitz in nine minutes sent Arsenal second in the English Premier League as they finally ended their hoodoo against champions Chelsea by winning 3-1 at Emirates Stadium on Monday night. Goals from Alex Song, Cesc Fabregas and Theo Walcott put Arsene Wenger's side two points behind leaders Manchester United, and ended a run of five successive defeats to Chelsea. Branislav Ivanovic pulled a goal back for the visitors, but it wasn't enough to end their miserable run of form as they continue to search for their first win since early November. The Gunners were handed a boost before kickoff as Spain midfielder Fabregas was restored to the starting lineup, as well as Dutch striker Robin Van Persie, but Chelsea's French forward Nicolas Anelka was absent with a knee injury. Football's heroes and villains of 2010 . The first half was a scrappy affair as Chelsea sat back and invited their opponents to attack them, with neither side creating much in the way of goalscoring opportunities. But that all changed five minutes before the break as Samir Nasri forced Chelsea keeper Petr Cech into a fine save with an effort that was curling towards the top corner. And just four minutes later Arsenal were ahead. Song exchanged passes with Wilshere, before picking up a loose ball in the area and driving it into the corner of the net. The home side came roaring out of the traps in the second half, as Walcott latched onto a loose pass from Michael Essien and drew Cech before squaring to Fabregas, who stroked the ball into an empty net on 51 minutes. Little more than a minute later the roles were reversed as Fabregas clipped a ball through to Walcott, who fired low past Cech from the edge of the area. Chelsea gave themselves a glimmer of hope on 57 minutes as Ivanovic glanced Didier Drogba's curling freekick into the net, but despite committing plenty of men forward the champions couldn't fashion a way back into the match. Nasri and Abou Diaby had chances to compound Chelsea's misery, but both squandered late opportunities. Chelsea's defeat is bound to heap more pressure on their Italian manager Carlo Ancelotti, who has presided over a wretched run of just one win in eight games. ""We have to wake up because we are asleep,"" he told Sky Sports after the game. ""We did not play well but Arsenal did and they deserved to win. We must stay focused and continue to work hard."" Arsenal boss Wenger said: ""We were disciplined, played for each other and were less nervous and perhaps less adventurous at some stages. ""Let's hope the game has strengthened our belief and that we can challenge for the championship.""","Arsenal beat Chelsea 3-1 in the English Premier League on Monday .

"Shocking claims of abuse within a secret NSW-based religious group have come to light after former members revealed the years of torment they endured at the hands their 'cult leader'. Self-styled guru Pastor Scott Williams allegedly used his warped brand of evangelical Pentecostalism to run a secret homosexual sex ring while misusing huge amounts of member donations for his own personal use. In harrowing and chilling detail, a young woman has recounted the experience of being born into and growing up in a twisted religious cult, as part of an in depth investigation by ABC's Four Corners. Emily Wassmann's involvement in the Christian Assemblies International (CAI) was predetermined before her birth, as her parents were both members of the 'church', and she described her childhood as a series of terrifying, confusing and lonely circumstances. Scroll down for video . Emily Wassmann relived the horrific experience of growing up in cult religious group Christian Assemblies International in a revealing interview with ABC'S Four Corners on Monday evening . 'The teaching was that a child was born evil and that that had to be beaten out of them with a rod of iron,' she told the program. Denied a life outside the church, at 14 Ms Wassaman told her parents she wanted to leave the group. She stayed living in their house but said they did not speak to her. Shortly after, at just 15, she was sent away to Canada to live with another church member. Here the young woman battled with her mental health and came close to attempting suicide on a number of occasions. Unlike some, Ms Wassmann and her parents escaped the Assembly, but said other young people who were born into the cult and left all experienced similar hardship. 'Every. Single. One.' When she was just 15, Ms Wassmann, pictured with her father, was sent away to live with church members in Canada after she told her parents she wanted to leave the group . Also revealed on the program was the slave-like status women in the church were afforded, and the verbal and physical abuse they suffered at the hands of the men in the CAI. Every aspect of their lives were monitored, from what they wore to how they raised their children. But the most shocking account was from a man named Gunther Frantz whose former wife was beaten by other men. In front of a group of men, stripped down to her underwear Mr Frantz's former wife was beaten with a wooden stick while her husband wasn't present - apparently for her lack of obedience. She was pregnant at the time, but her husband was unaware of this. When asked how he felt when he discovered his wife had been physically assaulted in his absence, Mr Frantz simply said: 'Makes you sick to your guts, doesn't it?' Gunther Frantz was one of Pastor Scott Williams' closest confidantes in the cult, and revealed his former wife had been beaten by other men in the church . Also aired in the shocking report, dozens of former members said bizarre sexual rituals were carried out in secret by Mr Williams, who had been given authorisation by God to sidestep biblical commands against homosexuality and train his male member to be sexually obedient. The abuse detailed by the men and women, who until now have remained silent out of fear and shame, ranged from spiritual, financial, verbal and physical abuse to sexual abuse of adult male members. 'I haven't come across anything like it,' Four Corners reporter Caro Meldrum-Hanna told Daily Mail Australia ahead of the episode going to air on Monday night. 'Former members describe it as a cult.' Pastor Scott Williams allegedly used his warped brand of evangelical Pentecostalism to run a secret homosexual sex ring while misusing huge amounts of member donations for his own personal use . Meldrum-Hanna, who came across the story back in 2010, spoke to dozens of former members in Australia and across the world and she said all of their claims made against Mr Williams were similar. 'Initially it appeared almost unbelievable because it was so extreme. But it happened,' she said. 'In the first six months you are treated like royalty but after that the screws turn. In order for Scott Williams to trust you, you had to give more of yourself, particularly for men.' Former members say they were recruited to the church as teenagers and young adults and they were brainwashed into believing Mr Williams was 'The Anointed One'. Former members say they were recruited to the church as teenagers and young adults and they were brainwashed into believing Mr Williams was 'The Anointed One' 'These people are so normal. Many weren't religious but they say they were preyed upon. So you can get an idea of how they were controlled,' Meldrum-Hanna said. Mr Williams left Australia 38 years ago to convert hundreds of young people to his religious group throughout Europe. The headquarters of CAI are now in Coffs Harbour in northern NSW. Meldrum-Hanna said the revelations weren't just based on the testimony of former members, but documents and financial records from CAI. 'There was enormous pressure placed on members to donate to this organisation. We're talking 10 percent of their gross income plus many more offerings throughout the year,' she said. The various former members interviewed by Four Corners left Mr Williams' group over a number of years but said there was a 'mass exodus' in 2006. The abuse detailed by the men and women, who until now have remained silent out of fear and shame, will be aired as part of a four-year ABC investigation . The headquarters of Christian Assemblies International group is now in Coffs Harbour in northern NSW . 'The ones who allege they were abused by Scott Williams... were concerned about others, like their own sons, so they came together to blow the whistle internally within the church,' Meldrum-Hanna said. Police carried out a four-year investigation of the CAI group and the results of that investigation will be revealed by Four Corners when it airs on Monday night. The program approached Mr Williams and senior people in the church about the claims, but all requests for interviews were denied. Mr Williams, now 70, lives with his wife Ree in a beachfront apartment in Coffs Harbour. It is one of the many properties he purchased with church donations.","Former members of NSW-based religious group have detailed claims of sexual abuse at the hands of leader Pastor Scott Williams .

"By . Jennifer Newton . An unknown man who captured his own image in a photobooth 445 times over 30 years is proving to be a mystery. Starting in the 1930s, he took black and white selfies in a photobooth over three decades until the 1960s, charting his passage through time. Most of the pictures show the mystery man grinning at the camera in the photobooth while others show him almost scowling as his mood changes. For three decades this unknown man took over 445 selfies in photobooths from the 1930s to the 1960s. They now form a new exhibition at Rutgers University . It is thought the man may have been a photobooth technician and took the pictures as a way of testing the equipment . Nobody knows for sure exactly who the man is, or indeed why he took the pictures of himself over the 30 years, especially as taking self portraits were a lot harder back then. In some of the pictures he is seen sporting a fedora and smoking a pipe, while other times he is dressed in a suit. The pictures are now being shared in an exhibition at Rutgers University in New Jersey in an appropriately named show called '445 Portraits of Man'. Nobody knows for sure exactly who the man is, or indeed why he took the pictures of himself over the 30 year period . The exhibit is being shown at the Rutgers' Zimmerli Art Museum in New Brunswick and they say they are taking these early selfies and showing them as art. The images on display of the unknown man were taken during a time when photobooths were hugely popular in the United States. The 445 prints are owned by historian Donald Lokuta, who bought the pictures two years ago at a New York City antiques show. The pictures are owned by historian Donald Lokuta, who bought the images at an antiques show in New York City in 2012 . He originally only came across a handful of the photographs but the dealer told him there were hundreds more images of the man and he decided to buy them all. Mr Lokuta told Rutgers: 'As a historian, I knew this was very rare, but on a deeper level, I wondered, ""Why would somebody want to take almost 500 photos of himself in a photobooth?""' 'Thereâ€™s quite an age difference in the photos: You see him as younger man and then with a white, receding hairline and wrinkles.' It is thought the mystery man in the pictures could be from the Midwest and it is hoped the exhibition will shed new light on his identity . Mr Lokuta also added that based on conversations with another historian, it could be likely that the mystery man was a photobooth technician, who was taking the pictures to test out the equipment. It is also likely that he hailed from the U.S. Midwest, and it is hoped the exhibition will shed new light on who the man is. It is thought the photos originated previously from an auction in Michigan.","Unknown man took 445 selfies between the 1930s and 1960s .

"(CNN) -- When someone tells you to go jump in a lake, sometimes it's best to take their advice. For one golfer, it saved him from a world of hurt. At first, Pablo Larrazabal thought nothing was out of the ordinary when he swatted an insect away from his face at a tournament in Malaysia on Friday. The next thing he knew, he was being attacked by a swarm of hornets. ""They were three times the size of bees,"" said the Spaniard. ""They were huge and 30 or 40 of them started to attack me big time. ""I didn't know what to do. My caddy told me to run, so I start running like a crazy guy, but the hornets were still there, so the other players told me to jump in the lake. ""I ran to the lake, threw my scorecard down, took off my shoes and jumped in the water. ""It was the scariest moment of my career, for sure. I've never been so scared."" Thankfully, after some treatment, the 30-year-old was able to continue. Remarkably, he birdied the hole he was on when the attack occurred -- the 14th -- then completed his second round in four-under-par 68, which meant he made the halfway cut of the European Tour event. ""The referees and a doctor took me aside and gave me a couple of injections and told me to relax,"" Larrazabal said on the European Tour website. ""After the injections I felt a lot better and could continue. Without the help of the referees I couldn't have finished the round, because I was in no state to play golf. ""Tomorrow it will be very, very scary to play that hole. I'm not sure what I'm going to do, but hopefully I will play it as quickly as I can."" Larrazabal, ranked 65th in the world, has won one tournament this year -- at January's Abu Dhabi Championship, where he beat major winners Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson by one shot to claim the $2.7 million first prize. He will go into the weekend at the Malaysian Open tied for 25th place, trailing leader Lee Westwood by 11 shots. The Englishman, a former world No. 1, followed up his opening 65 with a 66 to be four clear of European Ryder Cup teammate Nicolas Colsaerts. The Belgian was tied for second with 327th-ranked Antonio Lascuna of the Philippines, who finished 90th in the Kuala Lumpur tournament last year.","""I've never been so scared,"" says golfer Pablo Larrazabal .

"Liverpool are heading for Miami to do battle with arch rivals Manchester United on Monday after a comfortable 2-0 win over a dismal AC Milan side in Charlotte. Goals from Joe Allen and Suso made it three wins out of three for Brendan Rodgers' men in the International Champions Cup. Liverpool were already assured of top spot in their group following Manchester City's 5-4 defeat to Olympiacos on penalties earlier in the day after it had finished 2-2. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some of Liverpool's highlights from their pre-season US tour . Great start: Joe Allen is congratulated by Rickie Lambert after his opener for Liverpool against AC Milan . Young star: Raheem Sterling looks to take the ball of Milan midfielder Michael Essien . Spurned: Rickie Lambert missed a penalty for Liverpool, a great chance for an early goal in his Reds career . LIVERPOOL: Mignolet, Kelly (Johnson 60), Toure (Sakho 60), Coates (Skrtel 60), Robinson Enrique 60), Lucas (Gerrard 60), Henderson (Suso 46), Allen (Can 60), Lambert (Peterson 60), Ibe (Coutinho 60), Sterling (Coady 46). Goals: Allen (17), Suso (89). AC MILAN: Abbiati (Gabriel 46), Abate (Zapate 80), Bonera, Rami (Mexes 66), De Sciglio, Essien (Cristante 66), Muntari (Poli 80), Saponara, Niang, Pazzini (Balotelli 46), El Shaarway (Honda 66). Referee: David Gantar . However, they made no mistake in front of a 70,000-strong crowd at the Bank of America Stadium as they easily dealt with the challenge of Milan, who had already been heavily beaten by Olympiacos and Man City. Rodgers used no fewer than 21 players to ensure his squad is ready for the first showdown with United since Louis van Gaal's appointment as David Moyes' successor. With Daniel Sturridge ruled out with a minor knock sustained in training and £20million new boy Lazar Markovic sidelined by a tendon problem, Liverpool made five changes following the win over Manchester City in New York. Brad Jones, Jose Enrique, Steven Gerrard, Philippe Coutinho and Sturridge were replaced by Simon Mignolet, Jack Robinson, Lucas Leiva, Jordon Ibe and Raheem Sterling. Lightning-quick teenage wingers Ibe and Sterling lit up the opening 45 minutes as their pace tormented Milan's overworked backline. Liverpool were in control from the start and took the lead in the 17th minute. Big crowd: Kolo Toure lead the team out in Charlotte on Saturday . Relaxed: Already in the final, Brendan Rodgers was able to give Steven Gerrard a rest . Allen's work rate created the chance as he dispossessed former Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien and burst clear. The Wales international fired against the woodwork and Sterling's effort from the follow up was blocked by Christian Abbiati. The ball fell back into the path of Allen, who volleyed home in style. Sterling was then denied by Abbiati before Kolo Toure made a crucial tackle to thwart Giampaolo Saponara at the other end. Ibe, who enjoyed a beneficial loan spell at Birmingham City last season, showcased his exciting potential. The youngster was on the receiving end of some rough treatment from former Portsmouth man Sulley Muntari but he picked himself up and battled on. Keeping tabs: The Liverpool manager and his backroom staff observe the game . Ibe began the attack which should have yielded a second goal in the 27th minute. He raced 50 yards before linking up with Lambert and Sterling, who was pulled to the ground by Adil Rami. Lambert, who never missed in his 34 penalties for Southampton, took responsibility but his spot-kick was kept out by Abbiati. Milan did threaten just before the break but Mignolet grabbed Mbaya Niang's strike at the second attempt and Allen dealt with the danger after Stephan El Shaarawy raced into the penalty area. Suso and Conor Coady came on for Henderson and Sterling as Rodgers began to rest players with one eye on Monday's final in Miami. There were eight more changes on the hour mark with the introduction of Steven Gerrard receiving a rapturous ovation from the 70,000-strong crowd. The raft of subs dented the flow of the game and chances were at a premium. Making an impression: Jordan Ibe (left) battles with Mattia De Sciglio for possession . Ibe continued to shine with another classy burst down the left as he got the better of Rami but Milan survived. Gerrard sparked panic with a through ball to Suso which triggered a thundering collision between Gabriel and Mattia De Sciglio. The Liverpool skipper went close from long range before Milan threatened to restore parity. Mbaye Niang went clean through but Mignolet raced out and made a brave sprawling save. Muntari's strike was then deflected wide before Liverpool killed off the Italians in the 89th minute. Coutinho raced into space down the left and teed up Suso, who swept a low left-footer into the far corner. Mignolet's stunning finger tip save denied Bryan Cristante deep into stoppage time as Liverpool march on to Miami on a high.","Allen nets first-half opener against Serie A side .

"Could you give up the internet for Lent -  or even for good? Following various reports about companies stealing information and complaints about oversharing on social media, a web hosting firm has created a nine-step guide on how to disappear from the web completely. It includes deactivating accounts, removing links from search results and how to remove yourself from various lists - and for people who'd rather just stay hidden than disappear, the guide also gives tips on how to use the internet anonymously. The infographic, pictured, from London-based WhoIsHostingThis, details the nine steps needed to remove yourself from the web. It includes deactivating accounts, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+ . 1. Close your Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn accounts. 2. Search for yourself online and close any accounts you'd forgotten about. 3. Falsify information on accounts that can't be closed or deleted. 4. Unsubscribe from mailing lists. 5. Delete search engine results. 6. Contact websites directly and ask them to remove details about yourself. 7. Ask data clearing houses - companies that collect and sell data to other firms -  to remove your records. 8. Ask to be unlisted in phone books and online directories. 9. Delete your email accounts.

"Máiría Cahill won a by-election to fill the seat left vacant after Jimmy Harte of the Labour party resigned.
Labour candidate Ms Cahill won 122 of the 188 valid votes cast by serving senators and members of parliament.
Last year, she told the BBC she had been raped by an IRA man when she was 16, with the organisation forcing her into silence to protect itself.
The man she accused of raping her was prosecuted but later acquitted of all charges against him after two separate court cases in 2014.
Earlier this year, Northern Ireland's Public Prosecution Service apologised to Ms Cahill after a report into how it handled her allegations found delays in her case had been ""unacceptable"".
Ms Cahill is a member of one of the Irish republican movement's most prominent families.
But on Thursday, ahead of the by-election, she told Irish state broadcaster RTÉ she no longer considers herself a republican.
She said she was ""deeply sorry"" for her involvement in the dissident group Republican Network for Unity, adding that it coincided with a vulnerable point in her life.
""I didn't think about it at the time and I've had a lot of reflection since"" she said.
After her election, Ms Cahill said she would invite sex abuse organisations to the senate to discuss support for victims.
""I want to use my time [in the senate] to continue to work for victims of abuse,"" she said.
""That is the issue that has brought me to where I am today and it is the issue that I will continue to campaign on during my time as a senator.
""I also want to use my time to explore ways of engaging young jobseekers in this country and to help change their lives for the better.""
Ms Cahill had been the favourite to win the by-election.
The other candidates who stood were Fianna Fáil's Keith Swanick, who received 38 votes, Sinead Burke of Sinn Féin, who won 18 votes, and independent candidate Gerry Beades, who received 10.",A Belfast woman who has accused the IRA of a sex abuse cover-up has won a seat in the Irish senate.
"The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was the catalyst for a peace process in the restive Indonesian province of Aceh. Could Nepal's disaster also bring historic change?
What's been agreed?
Monday's 16-point agreement divides Nepal into eight federal states, the boundaries of which will be decided by a federal commission.  The names of the states will be decided by a two-thirds majority vote in assemblies to be set up in each state.
Nepal will have a parliamentary form of government with two houses. The lower house will have 275 members, 60% of whom will be directly elected, while 40% will be elected through proportional representation. The upper house will have 45 seats.
The prime minister will have executive powers and be chosen from the biggest party or coalition in parliament. The country will also have a ceremonial president elected by parliament and provincial assemblies.
A constitutional court will be set up for 10 years to resolve disputes.
Did the earthquake focus minds?
It's been nearly 10 years since Maoist rebels laid down their arms and joined Nepal's political process. Politicians agreed to write a new constitution by 2010, but have failed to come to an agreement.
When the earthquake hit on 25 April, Nepal's prime minister, Sushil Koirala, was out of the country. It was several days before he and other politicians took a visible lead in directing rescue and relief efforts.
There was a sense among Nepal's population that the political deadlock had affected the politicians' ability to respond to the crisis. They were under pressure to show they could deliver.
However some believe the stronger parties took advantage of this to push through a deal which did not reflect the wishes of Nepal's smaller parties.
What's the timetable?
It's expected a draft constitution will be ready by July. It will then need to be approved by a two-thirds majority in parliament - the four parties who signed this deal have the numbers to do this. They are the Nepali Congress, the UML, the Maoists and one of the parties representing the Madhesi ethnic group from the south.
A federal commission will then have six months to draw up the borders of the eight provinces and submit a proposal for approval in parliament, though there are fears this process could drag on for years.
What are the stumbling blocks?
The deal has been criticised as incomplete as it has yet to decide on the boundaries or names of the new provinces.
""The stumbling block is that the question of federalism, which has been at the heart of Nepali's political discourse for over five years now, has not been resolved,"" says Prashant Jha, author of Battles of the New Republic: A Contemporary History of Nepal.
There are fears that the commission to decide the boundaries could be politically influenced. Many small political parties which represent ethnic groups and people from the southern plains, the Terai, have already voiced their opposition. It's unclear whether their demands for better representation will be met.
Will it really happen?
After years of deadlock over the new constitution this is a significant breakthrough which sees the end of the division between Nepal's Maoists, who have been campaigning for federalism, and the country's established political elite who have been reluctanct to cede power from Kathmandu.
But the deal could fall through because it does not resolve the differences between the country's main parties and its marginalised social and ethnic groups who feel excluded from this deal.
""Until the big parties reach out to these forces, we cannot call this a social contract which has the buy-in of Nepal's diverse groups,"" says Prashant Jha.","Political leaders in Nepal have signed a deal on a long-awaited new constitution, just weeks after April's devastating earthquake."
"By . Victoria Woollaston . PUBLISHED: . 05:04 EST, 6 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:00 EST, 6 June 2013 . The world's oldest tumour has been discovered in the rib of a Neanderthal who lived around 130,000 years ago. Scientists at the University of Kansas took X-rays of the inch-long rib fragments - first found in the Krapina rock shelters of Croatia - and discovered parts of the inner bone were missing. Following CT scans the scientists discovered that this was likely to have been caused by soft-tissue tumour known in modern-day patients as fibrous dysplasia. Scans found that a small part of the inner bone network was missing and had been 'eaten away' by a soft-tissue tumour. This condition is called fibrous dysplasia . Fibrous dysplasia is an abnormal bone growth where normal bone is replaced with soft fibrous bone tissue. It can cause abnormal growth or . swelling of the bone. Although it can occur in any part of the . skeleton the soft tumours are most commonly found in the skull, thigh, shin, ribs, upper . arm and pelvis . Fibrous dysplasia is not cancerous but is rare and there is no known cure. The disorder is usually diagnosed in childhood or early adulthood. Males and females of any race are equally affected. The bones studied by Kansas university anthropologist David Frayer and his team were first excavated more than 100 years ago in Croatia. The site, known as the Krapina rock shelter, in the north of the country held more than 900 Neanderthal bones dating back from between 120,000 and 130,000 years ago. Frayer wanted to scan the bones because many of them showed signs of trauma and marks that happened after the neanderthal had died. Many of the 900 neanderthal bones found in Croatia had evidence of trauma or possible bite marks. This scan taken during the 1980s by researchers in Pennsylvania has a white area of overexposure which was the first evidence that a tumour had 'eaten away' the bone . The detailed scans show exactly where the bone has been 'eaten away' These marks suggest either cannibalism or burial rituals. Researchers . from the University of Pennsylvania took X-rays of the bones during the . 1980s and published a book containing all the radiographs. One of the inch-long rib fragments was shown to have sections of bone that were 'burned out' in the X-ray images. 'Burned out' sections of X-rays suggest over exposure, and in the rib bones this overexposure was caused by missing bone in the inner part of the fragment. Frayer used these images as a guide to take new, higher-resolution X-rays of the specimens. His team also scanned the bones using high-resolution microCT scanners that doctors currently use on modern-day patients. The microCT scan found that the 'spongy bone' which should be on the inner part of the fragment was missing and may have been 'eaten away' by a soft-tissue tumour. This type of tumour is seen in modern-day patients and is called fibrous dysplasia. Fibrous dysplasia is an abnormal bone growth where normal bone is replaced with fibrous bone tissue. It can cause abnormal growth or swelling of the bone and although it can occur in any part of the skeleton, it is most commonly found in the skull, thigh, shin, ribs, upper arm and pelvis . Fibrous dysplasia is not cancerous but is rare and there is no known cure. Frayer reported the findings in the journal PLOS ONE. He told LiveScience: 'People . of that time didn't live as long as they did today; plus, there weren't . very many of them compared to the Egyptians and people today. 'Finding evidence of tumors and evidence of cancers, is - . I don't know if I want to say ""lucky"" - but there isn't a lot of . evidence for it.' It was previously thought that climate change and a reduction in tree cover forced early man to stand up, but now experts believe the rocky African landscape played a far more significant role . Describing the type of tumour that was found, Frayer added: 'They range all the way from being totally benign, where you wouldn’t . recognize them, to being extremely painful. 'The size . of this one, and the bulging of it, probably caused the individual . pain.' Previously the earliest known tumours were found in Egyptian mummies dating back 4,000 years so this discovery predates this find significantly. A study released earlier this month discovered that Neanderthals lost out to homo sapiens in the battle to survive because they were not clever enough to adapt. The . results showed that . modern man walked the planet much earlier than was believed and Neanderthals died out much sooner than was estimated. Neanderthals had larger eyes than Homo sapiens but did not develop brain power in the same way. This meant that Homo sapiens were able to outsmart and ultimately outlive Neanderthals who had to use their brains more for physical rather than mental needs . Neanderthals breastfed their babies for over a year - just like humans, according to new research. Chemical . analysis of a neanderthal child's tooth reveal it was reared on . mother's milk for seven months with suckling continuing for the same . period coupled with solid food. The . change from breastfeeding to plants and grains can be established by . looking at differences in the distribution of barium – a similar . compound to calcium -  in teeth enamel. This . enabled Dr Manish Arora and colleagues at Mount Sinai School of . Medicine in New York to discover the early life diet of a 10 to 12 . year-old child that lived in a cave in Belgium around 100,000 years ago. The . brains of Neanderthals were the same size as those of modern man but . more of it was used to focus on the physical needs of their larger . bodies. Researchers from the University of York additionally found that early man began to walk on two feet because of rocky terrain and not climate change. The study found that our upright gait may . have its origins in the rugged landscape of East and South Africa which . was shaped during the Pliocene epoch by volcanoes and shifting tectonic . plates. Hominins, human's early ancestors, would . have been attracted to the terrain of rocky outcrops and gorges because . it offered shelter and opportunities to trap prey. But it also required . more upright scrambling and climbing gaits, prompting the emergence of . bipedalism.","Rib is up to 130,000 years old and was found in a cave in Krapina, Croatia .

World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops.
The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season.
Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap.
The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo.
Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa.
Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship.
The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four.
By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions.
Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat.
Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit.
Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: ""If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo.""
Kvyat replied: ""We didn't crash."" Vettel responded: ""You didn't. You were lucky this time."" Kvyat shrugged: ""I'm on the podium; you're on the podium.""
In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: ""You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium.""
Listen to Vettel's post-race rant
At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner.
In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass.
Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front.
Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance.
Listen to the first-lap madness
Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race.
So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart.
He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr.
""The car was pretty damaged,"" said the 31-year-old afterwards. ""I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place.""
Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a ""lot of aerodynamic performance"".
After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.

But this hungry hound took it too far when he swallowed a foot of fairy lights. Charlie, a seven-year-old crossbreed . dog from Southampton, had to be rushed to the operating table and saved by a team of vets who performed . life-saving surgery on him. Scroll down for video . All lit up: A team of vets had to operate on a dog that swallowed a foot of Christmas fairy lights . Owner Sharon Fay, who refers to her dog as the ‘light of her life’, became concerned when she noticed bits of wire sticking out of Charlie's faeces in the garden. The 45-year-old said: ‘I hadn't even noticed that the lights had been chewed at this stage but it quickly became clear what had happened. ‘Back in March he ate one of my scarves and needed an operation to remove it, but I thought it was just a one-off incident as he hadn't shown any signs that he was going to be a repeat offender. I've had dogs all my life and have never known a dog act like this before.’ An X-ray shed light on Charlie's problem - the tangled remains of the decorations showed up in his stomach and would have proved fatal if they were not removed. Shedding light on the situation: This X-ray shows the tangled remains of the decorations in the dog's stomach . A light snack: Charlie eyes up some fairy lights. He has a track record for eating bizarre objects like his owner's scarf . Vets rushed Charlie to the operating table and removed the Christmas decorations, also finding a shoelace. PDSA senior veterinary surgeon Sophie Bell said that she had never seen a case like this before. ‘Over the years I've seen plenty of cases of dogs swallowing strange objects - socks, dummies, rubber ducks, but it's the first time any of us have treated a dog that has actually eaten fairy lights,’ she said. ‘A foreign body of this nature could easily have caused severe internal injuries so Charlie was very, very lucky. He was also fortunate that the glass didn't cut his mouth or throat. And he could have been electrocuted if he'd bitten through the wire when the lights were switched on. 'Light of my life': Owner Sharon Fay became concerned when she saw bits of wire sticking out of Charlie's faeces in the garden . ‘With the Christmas season upon us, I'd advise owners to keep any edible items out of reach of inquisitive pets to avoid them from becoming ill over the festive season.’ Charlie returned home and has since gone on to make a full recovery, much to the delight of his owner. Ms Fay said: ‘I'll certainly be keeping an extra close eye on him from now on and have Charlie-proofed my house now.’ PDSA is advising pet owners to be extra cautious this Christmas. Its vets see many cases of pets getting their paws on inappropriate festive items every year, ranging from Christmas decorations, chocolate and cocktail sticks to toys, balloons and bones.","Sharon Fay was concerned when she saw wire sticking out of dog's faeces .

"By . Peter Allen . PUBLISHED: . 04:57 EST, 20 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:33 EST, 20 March 2013 . investigations: The French Foreign office is investigating reports that geologist Philippe Verdon was beheaded by terror group Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb on March 10 . Al Qaeda terrorists today claimed to have beheaded a French hostage in retaliation for his country’s war in Mali. Foreign Office officials in Paris said they were trying to verify reports of the horrific death of Philippe Verdon, who has been in captivity for the past 14 months. Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which is waging a terrorist campaign against the French Army in Mali, claims it cut the geologist’s head off on March 10 ‘in response to France’s intervention in Northern Mali.’ Referring to Francois Hollande, a spokesman for the group calling himself Al-Qairawani added: ‘The French President Hollande is responsible for the lives of the other French hostages.’ There are at least 14 French hostages currently held by Al Qaeda in west Africa, including seven by AQIM. It means that France, which has already lost five soldiers fighting in Mali since the war started in January, is slowly being sucked into an increasingly bloody terrorist war. Mr Hollande sent a force into Mali specifically to prevent the north of the country from being used as a launch pad for terror attacks in Africa and in the West. Mr Verdon, who is in his 50s, was captured on November 24 2011 along with Serge Lazarevic, a colleague. The men, who were on a business trip, were kidnapped from their hotel in Hombori, in the north of Mali. AQIM claimed that both men were secret agents or mercenaries, and later released a video of Mr Verdon in captivity. The hostages’ families have expressed growing fears about the men’s safety, especially following the invasion of Mali. On Monday, Mr Verdon’s father . Jean-Pierre Verdon said: ‘We are in a total fog and it is impossible to . live this way. We have no information.’ Captured: Mr Verdon has been held captive for 14 months, having been captured on November 24 2011 along with colleague Serge Lazarevic . No information: On Monday, Mr Verdon¿s father Jean-Pierre Verdon said: ¿We are in a total fog and it is impossible to live this way. We have no information¿ . The Verdon family were particularly concerned by Mr Hollande’s firm announcement that France would not pay ransoms. French forces arrived in Mali on January 11 to help the Malian Army against Al-Qaeda fighters who had controlled the north of the country since April 2012. France now has more than 4,000 troops on the ground in Mali, most carrying out clean-up operations after driving out most of the Islamist rebels from the area. Senior Al-Qaeda commanders Mokhtar Belmokhtar and Abdelhamid Abou Zeid are believed to have been killed in Mali earlier this month. A rescue operation ordered by Mr Hollande to free a French secret agent held hostage in Somalia since mid-2009 ended in failure in January after he was killed along with two French soldiers.","Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb claims to have beheaded Philippe Verdon .

"University of East Anglia researchers tested 594 bio-science students in their first week of term at five universities.
Almost all had a grade A*, A or B in biology at A-level. But on average they answered 60% of questions from their A-level core syllabus incorrectly.
The researchers blame an emphasis on teaching to the test.
Researchers tested students at:
They were told about the test beforehand but were not given any details about its content or subject focus. The researchers said it was unlikely,  therefore, that students would have revised for the test before taking it.
They were given 50 minutes to answer 38 multiple choice questions on cells, genetics, biochemistry and physiology.
Lead researcher for the study, Dr Harriet Jones, said: ""This is the first research carried out in collaboration with an exam board to investigate how much information is lost between students sitting their A-levels and arriving at university three months later.
""We found that students had forgotten around 60% of everything they learned for their A-levels.
""Universities expect their students to arrive with a high level of knowledge.
""What our research shows is that students are arriving at university with fantastic A-level grades, but having forgotten much of what they actually learned for their exams.""
Dr Jones said the trend to teach to the test, to ensure good results for schools' reputations, was the problem.
""This is undoubtedly a problem caused by secondary schools gearing all of their teaching towards students doing well in exams, in order to achieve league-table success,"" she said.
""But cramming facts for an exam doesn't give students a lasting knowledge of their subject.
""School and university have very different demands. In higher education, students cannot rely solely on memorising information, so it is important that students can adapt to a more in-depth approach to learning.""
In response to concerns that A-levels were not  preparing students adequately for the rigours of degree-level study, Education Secretary Michael Gove has announced changes to A-level courses.
From September 2015,  A-level syllabuses in England will be linear, with all assessment at the end of two years of study, rather than the current modular style of study.
Leading universities are also closely involved in developing the content of the new A levels, to ensure students are fully prepared for university study.
The UEA report said: ""If A-levels are to be redesigned to enhance their impact for students entering higher education, then creating programmes which encourage retention of key concepts should be a key factor to consider.""
The report concludes: ""Secondary education has become increasingly politicised, which involves greater emphasis on testing and results of tests, target setting and performance.""","University freshers struggle to remember basic concepts from their A-level studies, according to research."

An AFP spokeswoman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia they were investigating the allegations.

She said the girls who were most at risk of FGM were those who came from a community where the practice is accepted, or had a mother or sibling who had experienced it. In the case of the Brisbane girl, Ms Ferrari said the child had this history. 'The question could be asked if this could have been prevented because she had ticked two of these boxes,' she said. Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has urged relatives or friends to blow the whistle on anyone taking children abroad to undergo female genital mutilation. But it is virtually impossible for authorities to step in without evidence of somebody's intentions, Ms Bishop told Fairfax Radio on Tuesday. 'If somebody just presents with a passport and they're heading off overseas and we have no evidence to provide us with any cause to prevent the person leaving, then of course that happens,' she said. 'People are free to travel on an Australian passport if they have a valid passport.' Ms Bishop said it was vital family members or friends who were in the know about such plans let authorities know. 'This equally applies to foreign terrorist fighters,' she said. 'It's the families that we need to hear from if there are such matters occurring.' Relatives were the ones most likely to notice changes in behaviour or the beginning of radicalisation, Ms Bishop said.

"Carnes, Mississippi (CNN)  -- The deaths of two Mississippi teens are about to put a national focus on a little-recognized problem. Devon Byrd, 16, and Wade White, 18, were killed when a natural gas tank at a well production site exploded last fall in Carnes, in southern Mississippi. Local teenagers said the site is a popular hangout because it's quiet and secluded. But the dead teens' parents say the explosion could have been prevented if some warning signs had been posted -- ""something simple as fences, gates and signs, probably very inexpensive, and certainly a lot less expensive that what a child's life is worth,"" said White's father, Phillip. Police say they don't know exactly what ignited flammable vapors inside the tank. When it exploded, the teenagers were killed instantly. Their bodies were found about 40 yards from the tank's base; the tank landed another 20 yards from them. Investigators say they found a lighter, but don't know whether it was involved. ""I couldn't believe that my child was gone,"" White's mother, Wanda, told CNN. The White and Byrd families have an ally in their camp. The Chemical Safety Board, created by Congress, investigated the accident and found at least 40 other deaths involving oil and gas wells in the past 25 years. Most of them involved young people. The CSB says it found a patchwork of laws nationwide that don't uniformly address security around oil and gas wells. It's asking the industry to police itself by voluntarily installing fences and warning signs. ""If these tanks are sitting out there in the middle of nowhere, no protection around them, no warning, they are just an accident waiting to happen,"" CSB Chairman John Bresland told CNN. Delphi Oil, the company that owns the tank that blew up, told CNN it could not discuss the accident because of pending negligence lawsuits filed by the families. A spokesman called the boys' deaths tragic, but the company says it is complying with all rules. However, authorities tell CNN there are no state regulations requiring locked gates or no-smoking signs. ""He may be in compliance,"" Forrest County Sheriff Billy McGee told CNN. ""But there's nothing in the rules for him to be in compliance with."" Carnes is about 40 miles north of the Gulf Coast. In nearby Laurel, city zoning laws require oil and gas tanks to be fenced in with warning signs, according to Emergency Management District Executive Director Terry Steed. The CSB asked family and friends of Byrd and White to help them make an educational video about the dangers of oil and gas production sites. It's called ""No Place to Hang Out,"" and it's part of a national campaign starting this week to teach young people about the potential danger of tanks. But it also urges the industry to improve itself. ""There's nothing we can do to bring Devon and Wade back, "" said White's girlfriend, Maria Thompson, 16. ""But if it can save someone else's life, I'd like to see it happen."" ""Like McDonalds,"" added another friend, Shawn Ashlee Davis. ""They have to put 'Caution. This coffee's hot' (on their cups). I really think they need signs warning 'This is a dangerous place.' "" Mississippi state Sen. Billy Hudson told CNN he plans to introduce a state law requiring barbed-wire-topped fences, locked gates and ""Danger - Keep Out"" signs. ""There's no guarantees,"" Hudson said. ""You could cut the fence with a bolt cutter, or you can shoot off a lock. But it'll be a deterrent, and it's a step in the right direction."" White's father says his son would be proud that friends and family are speaking out: ""He'd be proud that we're trying to do something to keep other kids and other families from going through what we're going through.""","Two Mississippi teens killed when natural gas tank at well production site exploded .

"For a man who really did not want to talk on Saturday evening, Jose Mourinho woke on Sunday having had a serious re-think, invited himself on to Sky Sports and let loose. While admitting he might be talking his way to a touchline ban, the Chelsea manager launched a live verbal assault from his position on the Goals on Sunday sofa, taking aim at various targets which included an attack on Sky’s own coverage. It was very neatly planned and executed by a man employed as an ambassador for rival broadcasters BT Sport, and James Beattie, the show’s scheduled guest, was nowhere to be seen. Jose Mourinho says the incidents  in the 1-1 draw with Burnley were 'clear for everyone, not just me' Mourinho says referees should be given assistance by video technology if they can't get decisions right . 'Mourinho is wrong to imply an orchestrated campaign, but entitled to ask questions. His players, fine players, are frequently under siege.' Click HERE to read Sportsmail's Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel on Jose Mourinho's Goals on Sunday appearance . Mourinho has bemoaned these things for weeks but Burnley striker Ashley Barnes and referee Martin Atkinson pushed him over the edge as Chelsea dropped precious points in a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. He lashed out at Barnes, branding his tackle on Nemanja Matic ‘criminal’ and ‘career-ending’ and recalled for the audience a seven-match ban imposed on the striker two years ago when he tripped a referee while playing for Brighton against Bolton. And he called for more technology to help officials who ‘can’t see a penalty three metres in front of him’ and claimed Chelsea were ‘not getting the respect they deserve’ with a long sequence of bad decisions. It was an incredible performance, even by Mourinho standards of showmanship and revolved around his four chosen moments from the Burnley game: two failed penalty appeals and two challenges by Barnes. ‘What can I say that everybody doesn’t know?’ the Chelsea manager began. ‘Sometimes there is space for discussion where you have one view and I have another, but I can’t believe these four incidents are open to interpretation. This studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes infuriated Nemanja Matic and Mourinho backed up his player . Matic's reaction to Barnes's tackle earned the Serbian a red card - he'll now miss the Capital One Cup final . Mourinho shot from the lip during his surprise appearance on Goals on Sunday on Sky Sports . ‘At half-time Burnley should be playing with 10 men and Chelsea should have had two penalties and be winning 3-0, or let’s say 2-0 if we miss one of the penalties. The reality is that in the end we end the game with 10 men and we lose two points.’ The first penalty appeal was for handball when a shot by Branislav Ivanovic crashed into Michael Kightly’s outstretched arm. ‘The arm stopped the ball hitting the target,’ said Mourinho. ‘He’s far away; it’s not one metre, not a few inches, it’s quite far. Players should be taught to keep balance even in difficult situations, making difficult bio-mechanical actions and putting their arms behind the body to avoid this. For me, this is a penalty everywhere. ‘The best players in the world make mistakes, they miss penalties, and this gentleman is one of the top referees in this country and Europe and he can also make mistakes. He made four important mistakes. It is consistent but we must search for consistency in the right way. The lawyer who has lost 15 cases out of 15 is consistent but you don’t want that lawyer.’ The second penalty appeal was for a push by Jason Shackell on Costa, but Mourinho went back to the opening game of the Barclays Premier League campaign when his centre forward was booked for a dive at Turf Moor. Mourinho requested to go on Goals on Sunday and planned guest James Beattie had to make way . Atkinson, the referee for Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Burnley, was criticised for his decisions on Saturday . ‘The penalty story with Diego Costa started on day one, because it is a penalty and a red card for the goalkeeper,’ he said. ‘Michael Oliver — also one of the top referees in the country and soon to be one of the best in Europe — gives a yellow card to Diego and a free-kick against Chelsea.’ During the course of this 29-minute section of the show, he noted other penalties his team deserved but did not get — against Everton, Southampton, Liverpool and Tottenham — and insisted only once had he benefited from a dubious decision, when Gary Cahill escaped a handball at Liverpool. ‘Probably I am risking my place in the dug-out in the final because I risk being suspended by having this conversation in a studio,’ Mourinho went on. ‘I know in football sometimes you get them and sometimes you don’t but it’s too much. I try to be calm and controlled but my players are not getting the respect they deserve.’ When it came to analysing the Barnes challenges, one on Ivanovic and one on Matic, which provoked his dismissal for a retaliatory shove, the Chelsea manager said: ‘This Burnley player involved in two actions has a grey past. There was a very dark point in his career when he was at Brighton and suspended for seven matches, because of a big incident with a referee. Mourinho appeared to be agitated during the game too, airing his frustrations to media after the match . The Chelsea boss was particularly unhappy with the performance of referee Atkinson . ‘Should this player be chased because of what he did in the past? I don’t think so. When people look at these two incidents I hope they only see these two incidents. I don’t think it should have any relation with his history. ‘When I see Diego Costa on day one in the Premier League, penalty and red card to the goalkeeper, game over 2-0, transformed into a free-kick and yellow for Costa, I think he has changed country but brought with him his past in the eyes of the officials. This is clearly not fair. ‘When I finish the game against Liverpool and go to the dressing room, the first thing I see on the big screen we have in the dressing room is about Diego Costa’s ‘crimes’. Well, I would like to know how Sky Sports describe the actions of the Burnley player yesterday when you call what Diego Costa did a crime.’ With his sidekick Chris Kamara struck by temporary paralysis beside him, Sky host Ben Shephard admitted there may have been a mistake with the language in the immediate aftermath of Costa’s stamp on Emre Can, in the Capital One Cup semi-final, which prompted a three-match ban. Mourinho covered a range of subjects during his appearance on Goals on Sunday . ‘Did you apologise to Chelsea or to Diego or to me as Chelsea manager?’ asked Mourinho. ‘You did not. You never apologised. I don’t like the use of language and don’t like it that immediately there is public judgment. ‘You give no space to the people who have to decide. The pressure was so much that it gave no space and you don’t do this with every club and every player. When you say Diego’s “crimes” because he put his foot on another man you have to say this is a criminal tackle, minimum. When Diego Costa had a three-match ban, tell me how many matches you think this player deserves. ‘What happened was similar to what happened to Eden Hazard at Stoke but I would say yesterday was worse because this was “end of career”, I can’t find an adjective any stronger than to say “end of career”. Matic is a lucky guy. I can’t find words to describe what that player did. ‘Matic had reason to lose his emotions. What are the consequences of Matic’s push on the other player? Nothing. One second later, he stands and goes. The consequence for Matic could be the end of career.’ Mourinho did not appear satisfied with a post-match conversation he had with Atkinson at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. ‘I am not attacking the honesty of anyone,’ he added. ‘I am not trying to bring the game into disrepute — a sentence you love in this country because this is always what they use when they want to punish me. I’m just trying to be honest. ‘Of course, they are trying but they are not doing it well. If the ref can’t see a penalty three metres in front of him some referee in front of a screen can’t miss it. It will protect the integrity and honesty of the referees. I think technology can help.’ Mourinho stuck around with Shephard and Kamara to analyse the rest of the Saturday action but by then he had got what he wanted to off his chest. 30 - Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up when he realises no action is being taken. It should have been a free-kick and could have been a yellow card for Barnes.

"A glitch on the United Airlines website saw travellers offered return, first class flights from London to Newark for just $74 (£49). The round-trip first class tickets from Heathrow to Newark, just outside of New York City, were snatched up by lucky holidaymakers for just 491 Danish krone due to an apparent error on the site. By registering as a customer in Denmark, holidaymakers could snap up the deal, which would normally set them back $5,618 (£3,690) and $6,778 (£4,452). For a brief period of time on February 11, round-trip, first class fares from London to Newark were available on United.com for just £49 . It is unclear how the deal happened and it appears United has since made changes to prevent anyone else from purchasing the cheap tickets. One customer who snapped up the bargain fare said she simply logged on to United.com and changed her country status to Denmark. She then chose her dates and made sure to select business class or first class from the drop down menu, for example March 19 to March 25. Then, using a credit card without a foreign transaction fee, the purchase was completed and a confirmation email sent, although the customer did say she left her country as 'Denmark' when filling out her postal address. The unbelievable fare totalled 491 Danish krone, which comes to £49 or approximately US$74 . Despite the low costs, two customers reported 'miscellaneous' charges when they came to play, adding up to $326 (£214) to the price of the ticket. It is not known what these costs represent, but both customers said they were happy to pay as the price still worked out much cheaper than a full price first class ticket. MailOnline Travel attempted to secure the same deal at approximately 16:20 GMT, but found that selecting Denmark from the country drop down menu was no longer an option. A second customer secured first class transatlantic flights for a total of 1,356DKK - around $206 or £135 . The country option was then turned back to United Kingdom. It is as yet unclear how many people snapped up the flights during the time of the glitch and whether the airline will honour the bookings. According to a statement provided to MailOnline Travel: 'United has temporarily suspended sales from its Denmark website because a third-party software provider applied an incorrect exchange rate and was misquoting the airline’s properly filed fares. 'This error in the application of the exchange rate primarily impacted individuals who live outside of Denmark and who were not traveling to or from Denmark but were attempting to book tickets using United’s Denmark site.'","Earlier this afternoon, United.com glitch offered hugely discounted fares .

"The charity's offices in Cardiff and Prestatyn received separate calls from boys who were worried about the effect pornography was having on them.
ChildLine has launched a campaign to tackle what it calls the ""shocking"" number of 12 to 13-year-olds afraid they are ""addicted to porn"".
One of the Welsh youngsters said pornography made him feel ""perverted"".
The children's counselling charity - which is calling its campaign the Fight Against Porn Zombies - said a UK-wide poll of 700 children showed that one in five had seen pornographic images that shocked or upset them.
One boy who spoke with a counsellor at the charity's Cardiff base said: ""I've started to view girls a bit differently recently and it's making me worried.
""I would like to get married in the future but I'm scared it might never happen if I carry on thinking about girls the way I do.""
Another youngster who contacted the Prestatyn office said: ""I can't help looking at girls in a sexual way and I think it's because I watch a lot of porn.""
Des Mannion, NSPCC national head of service for Wales, said: ""Children of all ages today have easy access to a wide range of pornography and if we as a society shy away from talking about this issue, then we are failing the thousands of young people it is affecting.""",Welsh children have contacted ChildLine to express concerns about their exposure to pornography.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Twenty men are engaged in fiery debate on a sidewalk near Nairobi's Westgate mall, where terrorists stormed the shopping center and killed at least 67 people. A man at the center gestures emphatically as some listen and nod. Others shake their heads. Here and at coffee shops and barbershops and social spots the debate is much the same: Should Kenya withdraw its troops from Somalia after terrorists stormed the mall? The terrorists who attacked the mall on Saturday claimed to be members of Somalia-based Al-Shabaab and barked out their resentment of Kenyan troops in their country. ""They said, 'We are the Al-Shabaab, we are here to kill you for killing our women in Somalia,'"" said Jane Kamau, who hid in a box when attackers opened fire at the mall. Kenya entered a high-stakes gamble two years ago when it sent troops to neighboring Somalia to flush out the Islamist militants it accused of kidnapping and killing foreigners in the coastal area. The abductions affected Kenya's once-bustling tourism industry, a major hit to the nation's revenue. Al-Shabaab vowed to attack Kenya until it withdrew its troops. Since then, grenades have landed at bus stops, churches, mosques and bars, killing dozens. Militants have regularly taken to social media to brag about their attacks and to threaten more. 'We need to protect our borders' John Mutua, part of the sidewalk debate, said keeping troops in Somalia is not the best option. ""We need to get them out,"" said the 34-year-old businessman. ""They'll keep killing us, and we'll continue killing them --- it will never end. We should all stop fighting, start afresh."" Next to him, bank teller John Kamau, 28, shakes his head vehemently. ""That's nonsense, it's not that easy,"" he said. ""We're already in too deep. We will be considered cowards if we get out. They (Al-Shabaab) started it by killing and kidnapping people in our own land."" Mutua waves him off. He tries to draw in a Kenyan soldier standing guard near the cordoned-off area near the mall. ""Do you guys like being in Somalia?"" Mutua asks. The soldier glares at him and turns the other way, clutching a long rifle. At a barber and hair-stylist shop about 20 miles from the mall, a similar debate is under way. Jane Njeri sits under a buzzing hair dryer. She pops her head out long enough to give her two cents, before tucking her head back. ""The reason the troops invaded is because our borders were porous to begin with,"" she said. ""We need to fix our security. We need to protect our borders. Those troops fighting in Somalia, we need to bring them home to help with those efforts. If we fix our security, we don't have to fear terrorists."" Philex Ambani, 23, said sending the troops there was not a good idea to begin with. But they should stay, he said. ""If they want our soldiers to get out, they need to stop killing us,"" he said. ""It's that simple. It wasn't worth it to go there over a bunch of tourists, but we are already there. We can't give up now. "" The Westgate mall standoff ended Tuesday, according to government officials. It was the worst terror attack in the nation since al Qaeda blew up the U.S. Embassy in 1998, leaving more than 200 dead. Kenya's president steadfast . Kenya is East Africa's biggest economy and a crucial trade route into the rest of the continent. It is also a major U.S. ally in the war against Islamist militants in the region. It provides an important buffer of stability in a region that includes the fledgling Somali government and the politically tense Sudans. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has ruled out the withdrawal of the military, which is now part of the African Union forces battling the militants in Somalia. ""We went as a nation to Somalia to fight the war against terror unleashed on Kenyan people, Somali people and people around the world,"" Kenyatta said this week. ""This is not a Kenyan war, this is an international war."" Godwin Murunga, deputy director of the African Leadership Centre in Nairobi, said the threat facing Kenya is complex and withdrawal from Somalia is not advisable. But revamped security in the nation, he said, will go a long way. ""Kenya needs to bring its citizens together to recognize security threats, to mobilize them into a common security consciousness and surveillance system that they trust and have confidence in,"" Murunga wrote in an opinion piece for CNN. 'Don't ask me about Shabaab' Having seen what happened to many of the victims of the mall massacre, Agnes Mumbua said she will do whatever she can to help protect herself. A Catholic, she plans to learn how Muslims pray and the names of major Islamic figures. Survivors of the mall massacre have said attackers asked victims whether they were Muslims. Those who failed to answer questions about Islam were killed, they said. ""If learning the Quran will help save me, I will do what it takes,"" she said. ""It seems the Kenya government is not leaving Somalia soon, so I might as well protect myself."" Government officials have said the terror attack killed 62 people and five of the suspected 15 terrorists. At least 61 people remain missing, the Kenyan Red Cross has said. Back on the sidewalk near Westgate, insurance agent Frederick Omolo shakes his head when asked his opinion about Al-Shabaab. ""Don't ask me about Shabaab. I don't want to hear that word in my life, ever,"" he said. He's listening to the debate on the militant group, a brown envelope in his hand. In it are life insurance documents for his friend John, whom he was going to meet at a coffee house at the mall. He was in the parking lot on his way to drop them off for John to sign when he heard gunshots and took off, clutching the envelope. His friend never left the mall. No one has seen him since. ""On second thought,"" Omolo said, ""let's improve our security big time, post armed cops in major public venues, do a sweep of areas suspected of harboring terrorists, then keep our troops in Somalia to do the job."" Omolo passed by the mall every day during the hostage crisis and sat on a sidewalk behind the police barricade, holding the insurance papers. They are still in the brown envelope.","Kenyan troops have been in Somalia since 2011 to try to root out terrorists .

Promise: Aktabantay (right) under jockey Ryan Moore won Group Three Solario Stakes at Sandown on Saturday . Palmer, 33, said: ‘It is something we will discuss over the next few weeks. He is also in the Dewhurst Stakes. He is lovely horse for next year. ‘We would get quick ground and a fast pace in the Breeders’ Cup — they go flat to the boards — and he will be suited by that. He is a very exciting horse.’ Having won valuable handicaps at both Glorious Goodwood and York’s Ebor meeting this summer, the Solario win of Aktabantay was a first at group level for Palmer, a scion of the biscuit-making family.

"Washington (CNN) -- South Carolina officials head to federal court on Monday to defend a controversial new voter identification law, dismissing suggestions the requirement would deny tens of thousands of people, many of them minorities, access to the ballot. A weeklong trial will kick off in Washington before a panel of three judges who will decide whether the law should take effect. It is one of several legal challenges to voter identification laws nationwide. A key enforcement provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, gives the federal government open-ended oversight of states and communities with a history of voter discrimination. Any changes in voting laws and procedures in those areas must be ""pre-cleared"" with Washington. South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson has defended the law, saying it will not harm any potential voter. ""The changes have neither the purpose nor will they have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority,"" Wilson said. The Justice Department blocked the measure from taking effect last year, concluding it was discriminatory. Federal officials cited figures that registered minority voters were about 20 percent more likely than white voters to lack state-issued photo identification. The Justice Department estimated that more than 80,000 people in South Carolina could be adversely impacted by the planned requirements. Republican Gov. Nikki Haley has called the Justice Department's decision ""outrageous"" and ordered a lawsuit. State officials have deflected criticism the legal battle could end up costing taxpayers $1 million or more. ""It wouldn't cost anything if (U.S. Attorney General) Eric Holder and the Department of Justice would get out of the way and let us protect our citizens and enforce our laws,"" Rob Godfrey, a spokesman for Haley, said earlier this year. A decision in the case could take weeks. In legal filings with the court, South Carolina officials said a law dating to 1988 requires a state-issued voter registration card and the voter's signature at the polls. The amended law approved last year would permit five types of photo identification: a state-issued driver's license, a non-driver identification card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, military identification, a U.S. passport, or state voter registration card. Waivers are allowed, but the voter must sign an affidavit specifying why she or he has a ""reasonable impediment"" to getting the necessary identification or has a religious objection to being photographed. If the law takes effect, South Carolina would be among 11 states that require official photo identification at the polls, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Proponents say the drive is an effort to stop what officials contend is voter fraud and to purge voter rolls of outdated information. Supporters say having valid, government-issued photo identification is a reasonable, modern-day necessity. Opponents assert that the effort disenfranchise poor, minority and disabled voters. Obama administration officials have concluded there is little evidence of voter fraud in the state warranting the legislative changes. A coalition of civil rights groups is expected to testify at next week's hearing, offering testimony from college students and elderly residents. Those groups say claims of voter fraud are exaggerated. ""South Carolina's photo ID measure is a solution in search of a problem. Credible studies show that one is more likely to be struck by lightning than to perceive an instance of in-person voter fraud,"" Ryan Haygood, a top lawyer at the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund, said. ""The [upcoming] trial will make clear that the state's proposed photo identification measure will have a significant impact on its minority voters."" The NAACP says that a quarter of African-Americans and 16 percent of Latinos nationally lack any kind of government-issued photo identification. A separate federal panel is considering similar challenge to a voter identification law in Texas. A federal trial was held last month and a ruling is expected soon. Both South Carolina and Texas say they will put their laws in place in time for the November elections, if they are upheld. It is possible the losing sides could ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene, delaying any immediate implementation. Other Republican-controlled states with similar laws under legal challenge include Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. The Justice Department this week gave approval to Virginia's less restrictive voter identification measure. North Carolina Gov. Beverly Perdue vetoed a law passed by the GOP-led General Assembly. The Supreme Court in 2008 allowed Indiana's voter identification law to stand in 2008, saying the stated goal of stopping voter fraud was a legitimate exercise of legislative power.","Panel of federal judges will decide whether voter identification law should take effect .

"Mobile, Alabama (CNN) -- Brianna Adkins stepped off the Carnival Triumph early Friday and into the arms of her anxious parents, bringing to an end the nightmarish journey aboard a crippled ship that was towed to port days after it was due. It was a big, tight hug between 18-year-old Adkins and her mom and dad, the kind filled with the emotion that reflected the days of uncertainty after the cruise ship was left virtually dead in the water after a reported engine fire knocked out power. ""Just to be with them, just to let them know I'm safe,"" Adkins said, fighting back tears. ""It means just so much to be with them ... you have no idea."" My celebration trup on the Carnival Triumph: From joy to misery . A near party-atmosphere abounded aboard the cruise ship as it docked late Thursday at the Alabama Cruise Terminal, where some passengers hung over balcony rails, while others danced and waved signs. ""I kissed the ground when I got off,"" said Adkins of Noblesville, Indiana, just north of Indianapolis. The saga began unfolding early Sunday morning as the Carnival Triumph, originally carrying 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew members, was making its way to Galveston, Texas, when a fire left the vessel listing to the side and drifting in the Gulf of Mexico. The ship drifted nearly 90 miles before enough tugboats arrived to tow the massive cruise ship to Mobile. Almost immediately, reports emerged on social media of deteriorating conditions aboard the ship. Passengers reported sewage sloshing in the hallways and, in some cases, running down the walls of cabins. Still others said the power outage forced people, especially those in the lower decks or inside cabins, to drag their mattresses to outside decks because of stifling heat. The power outage also made it impossible for passengers to call loved ones. Why did it take five days? For those who were able to get messages out -- drafting on wireless from cruise ships dropping supplies -- it was a few moments to reassure loved ones they were OK. Still, for Adkins and others there was nothing better than being able to put both feet on firm ground while wrapping their arms around family members. ""The unknown was the worst part,"" Adkins mother, Beth, said. About 75 families were on hand, according to a spokesman for the City of Mobile, at the Alabama Cruise Terminal. Family members who spoke to CNN said they had come from Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana and Texas. Some had come in as early as Wednesday but the bulk of people arrived Thursday afternoon, with each hour bringing a few more cars. After a bad cruise, can you cruise into court? Most of the anxious families couldn't bear the thought of their relatives being on a bus for hours and had gotten hotel rooms in Mobile where the homecoming would include a long shower and a meal. Brooklyn Burgess, 18, got off the ship scanning the crowd for father and brother, who had driven from their Carthage, Mississippi, home to get them and bring them home. There in the crowd, she and her mother, who was traveling with her, found the family. Her father picked her up in a tight hug, and Burgess started to cry. ""I said I don't have a boyfriend. ... I sure hope somebody who missed me is there waiting for me,"" she said, her eyes red from tears. Video: Passengers spell out help . For others, it will be a little longer before they connect with loved ones. Brittany Ferguson and Kendall Jenkins, both 24, got off the ship cheering and dancing. Jenkins went so far as to lay kneel down and kiss the ground. ""We won this cruise at a Houston Rockets game. Lucky us,"" Ferguson said, laughing. They are among the many who boarded one of the more than 100 motor coaches that were reserved by Carnival to take them to New Orleans where many will overnight before continuing their journey home. The two are headed home to Houston. But that's OK with the Ferguson and Jenkins because they have ""land under our feet."" Spate of fires hits cruise industry .

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Preliminary DNA tests indicate a 3-year-old foster child is the son of a woman being held captive by leftist rebels, Colombian officials announced Friday. Clara Rojas appears in a video released by the kidnappers in July 2002. ""There is a very high probability that Juan David belongs to the family of Clara Gonzalez de Rojas,"" Mario Iguaran Arana, the country's chief federal prosecutor, said at a news conference. The boy, known as ""Emmanuel,"" has been at the center of a hostage drama that raised hopes the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia would liberate some of their hostages. The rebel group, known as FARC for its Spanish acronym, had agreed to release three hostages as part of a deal brokered by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. FARC said it would release Emmanuel along with his mother, Clara Rojas, and another woman, Consuelo Gonzalez, but the mission to free the captives fell apart December 31, when the rebel group said it could not release the hostages because of Colombian military operations in the area, according to a FARC statement Chavez read on Venezuelan television. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe denied the group's assertion, saying there were no combat operations in the area near the rebels, and he said the rebels could not release the three hostages because they did not have Emmanuel in custody. He raised the possibility that Emmanuel, who was born in captivity to Rojas, was living in a foster home in the Colombian capital of Bogota. Authorities in Colombia suspect the FARC duped child-welfare authorities by presenting the boy as a child in need of foster care in 2005, he said. On Friday, Iguaran Arana said initial DNA results will be checked against tests being done in European labs to verify the child's identity. There was no immediate response from Venezuela after the announcement concerning Emmanuel's DNA. However, a statement on the Venezuelan government's Web site from earlier Friday said the Colombian government had not allowed Venezuela to participate in the DNA testing. Established in 1964 as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party, FARC is Colombia's oldest, largest, most capable and best-equipped Marxist rebel group, according to the U.S. Department of State. The United States, the European Union and Colombia classify it as a terrorist group. FARC has justified hostage-taking as a legitimate military tactic in a long-running and complex civil war that also has involved right-wing paramilitary units, government forces and drug traffickers. Fighting has waned, but not stopped, in recent years. Among the group's hostages are three American contractors who were captured when their plane went down in 2003 during a drug-eradication flight, and Ingrid Betancourt, a French-Colombian independent presidential candidate who was kidnapped in 2002. Rojas was kidnapped in 2002 while she managed Betancourt's campaign. Betancourt is perhaps the best-known captive in Colombia, a country plagued by kidnapping.

"By . Damien Gayle . Abu Hamza saw violence as necessary to defend Muslims and saw physical training for jihad as an obligation for all Muslim men, a court heard on Wednesday. James Ujaama, a U.S.-based associate of Hamza, told jurors in the New York court that the Islamist cleric had instructed him to set up a jihadist training camp in the U.S. U.S. prosecutors hope Ujaama's testimony will convince a federal jury that the preacher is guilty of trying to set up the camp to aid al Qaeda. The charges against him carry a potential life sentence. Facing life in jail: Islamist cleric Abu Hamza pictured in a court sketch at the Federal Court in Lower Manhattan, New York, where he is on trial for allegedly setting up terrorist training camps in the U.S. One-eyed, handless Hamza, 56, is also accused of supporting al Qaeda in Afghanistan and of providing assistance to militants who kidnapped 16 Western tourists in Yemen in 1998. Four of the hostages were killed during a rescue operation. Hamza's lawyers have argued that he used inflammatory rhetoric but did not commit any crimes. The court saw a copy of a fax that Ujaama sent to Hamza, then a preacher at London's Finsbury Park mosque, telling him about a ranch in Oregon where he hoped to set up the training camp. 'The land that we spoke of is about 160 acres and looks just like Afghanistan,' Ujaama said in the fax. He added that Oregon was a 'pro-militia and firearms state' where it would be easy to stockpile weapons for combat training. Ujaama, who pleaded guilty in 2003 to conspiring to aid the Taliban, appeared as part of a cooperation deal with prosecutors and is expected to remain on the witness stand for several days. As a former associate of Hamza, Ujaama is a key government witness. His testimony is expected to cover not only Oregon but the allegation that Abu Hamza sent a man to Afghanistan to receive military training with al Qaeda. Hamza with a masked bodyguard, outside the closed Finsbury Park Mosque: Government witness James Ujaama met with Hamza at the mosque soon after the American returned from training in Afghanistan . Ujaama said he first met the fiery preacher in London in 1998, shortly after returning from a trip to Afghanistan where he attended training camps with religious extremists. The two men discussed Islamic teachings over tea and cookies at Abu Hamza's second-floor office at the Finsbury Park mosque, Ujaama said. 'I walked away from that meeting very impressed with Sheikh Abu Hamza,' Ujaama was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. Soon after, Ujaama was working for Abu Hamza, writing and publishing articles online for an organization called Supporters of Sharia run by the preacher. One piece - titled 'A Declaration of War' - summarised Osama bin Laden's call to take up arms against the U.S., Ujaama said. 'Was Abu Hamza overseeing you when you posted this statement?' asked Assistant U.S. Attorney John Cronan. 'Yes, he was,' Ujaama replied. Police outside Finsbury Park mosque after a raid: Ujaama told the court that he and Hamza discussed Islamic teachings over tea and cookies in a second-floor office there and he then began working for the preacher . In 1999, Ujaama said, the two men arrived in Oregon from the United Kingdom and were disappointed to find that Ujaama's camp did not have many weapons or recruits. Ujaama said he was threatened by one of the men, Oussama Kassir, who claimed to be a former bodyguard for Osama bin Laden. In the coming days, Ujaama is also expected to testify that Abu Hamza ordered him in 2000 to take another man, Feroz Abbasi, to Afghanistan to seek out training with al Qaeda. Egyptian-born Hamza lost his hands and one eye in Afghanistan in the 1980s. A British court convicted him 2006 of inciting followers to violence and he served six years in prison before his extradition to the U.S. in 2012.","James Ujaama tells Federal court that Hamza asked him to set up the camp .

The monarch and Duke then met trustees, supporters and volunteers before meeting local school children learning about the Battle of Britain in the dedicated education area, The Geoffrey Page Centre. The Queen and The Duke also visited the 'Cockpit Café', where they met a group of 'The Few', surviving RAF airmen who fought in the Battle of Britain in the Second World War, before viewing a flypast of a Hurricane, Spitfire and Typhoon. As part of her duties, the Queen unveiled a plaque to mark the opening and received a posy. In the 1980s, Wing Commander Geoffrey Page, a Hurricane pilot who was shot down during the Battle of Britain, realised that there was no national memorial to the men he had with flown with in 1940. His efforts to amend this led to the founding of the Battle of Britain Memorial Trust and the unveiling of the National Memorial to the Few – a lone pilot looking out over the English Channel, in the village between Folkestone and Dover – by Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- Florida Law enforcement officials said Monday they had launched an investigation into a tragic boating accident near St. Augustine, Florida, that took the lives of five people and seriously injured seven others. CNN affiliate WJXT shows the scene of the deadly boating accident near Jacksonville, Florida, on Sunday. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has taken over as the lead agency involved in the investigation. The incident took place on Sunday around 7:15 p.m., in the intracoastal waterway in St. Johns County, Florida, about 20 miles north of St. Augustine. According to FWC investigators, a 22-foot boat with 12 people on board rammed into the rear and right side of a 25-foot tugboat. ""We are still investigating and haven't come to any conclusions yet,"" said Carol Pratt, spokeswoman for FWC. She said they still do not know who was driving the boat. They also are waiting for victims' next of kin to be notified before releasing any of their names and ages. The tugboat was at a dock and boat launch under construction on the Intracoastal Waterway in Palm Valley, said Jeremy Robshaw, a spokesman for St. Johns County Fire and Rescue. Robshaw said rescuers couldn't initially reach the end of the unfinished dock, but laid plywood sheets on the structure to get to crash victims. No one was onboard the tugboat, which is registered to F&A Enterprises in St. Augustine. The seven injured were taken to Shands Jacksonville Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida. Two patients remain in critical condition, one is considered serious and three are in fair condition. A hospital spokesman did not have information on the seventh victim. FWC told CNN that they hope to release more information on the incident and on their investigation. As in any accident, toxicology studies will be done on the driver of the boat, to determine whether he or she was impaired, spokesman Carol Pratt told CNN.","Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission takes lead in the investigation.

"China’s first budget airline is poised to lobby industry regulators for permission to install standing-only ‘seats’ on its planes so it can cram more people on board. Shanghai-based Spring Airlines said it would offer cheaper fares to those who are willing to stand at a vertical seat, according to China National Radio. It’s not the first time the idea has been floated – Dublin-based Ryanair famously proposed selling standing-only tickets in 2009 to increase passenger traffic and cut costs. China's Spring Airlines wants to install 'vertical seats' on its planes so it can cram more passengers on board . Spring Airlines chairman Wang Zhenghua confirmed to China National Radio that he wants standing-only cabins on his planes and is seeking government approval. The 70-year-old billionaire told the broadcaster that he began exploring the idea in 2008 after a chaotic Chinese New Year travel rush. Customers told China National Radio that they would be hesitant to buy a ticket for a vertical seat out of safety concerns. One told the broadcaster that she fears passengers would be injured when the plane flies through bad weather or is rocked by turbulence. Spring Airlines said it would offer cheaper fares to those who are willing to stand at a vertical seat . Spring Airlines plans to work with manufacturers on a design that would include a safety belt. The low-cost carrier, founded in 2004, offers flights as cheap as £1 ($1.50) and flies to destinations in China, Japan, Thailand and other Asian countries. Even though designs have been proposed and no-frills airlines have expressed interest, the vertical seat concept has not taken off because it hasn’t received approval from authorities. Ryanair abandoned its proposal in 2012 after it was thwarted by an unnamed regulator. The Irish carrier planned to install ten rows of vertical seats on its planes – increasing capacity by about 40 passengers – and charge less than £5 to travellers who were willing to stand. Airbus filed a patent for a new seat that is similar to a bicycle saddle that flips up when it is not in use . Italian firm Aviointeriors designed the ‘Skyrider’ seat, which was inspired by saddles used by cowboys . Last year, Airbus filed a patent for a new seat that is similar to a bicycle saddle that flips up when it is not in use. The design, intended for short-haul flights, would increase capacity for airlines and leave passengers with even less space. In 2010, Italian firm Aviointeriors unveiled its design for the ‘Skyrider’ seat, which was inspired by saddles used by cowboys. In that seat passengers would sit at an angle with just 23in of legroom between them and the seat in front of them – about seven inches less than the average seat pitch on most planes.","Spring Airlines said it would offer cheaper fares for those willing to stand .

"HUNTINGTON, Utah (CNN)  -- Rescuers trying to find six miners will begin boring a sixth hole down into Utah's Crandall Canyon mine Friday, and the search will stop if no signs of life are found, the coal mine's co-owner said. Bob Murray, CEO of Murray Energy Corp., says he is hurt by criticism he did not do enough to find the miners. ""This is the last hole,"" Bob Murray, CEO of Murray Energy, said Wednesday evening. ""If we don't find anybody alive in that hole, there's nowhere else that anyone ... would know where to drill."" Murray said work on the sixth hole, which will go down into the area where the miners were known to be working when the mine collapsed August 6, should be completed by Saturday. However, he expressed little optimism that the effort would be successful, saying it was ""totally unlikely"" any signs of the miners will be found. Murray also said that he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the Utah mine. ""I will never come back to that evil mountain,"" he said. Earlier Wednesday, a fifth hole drilled down into the mine found just six inches of open space left between the roof and rubble in an 8-foot-high tunnel, said Jack Kuzar, a district manager with the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. Kuzar said the fifth hole would be tested for oxygen, and a camera may be lowered down the shaft, although the small amount of space may limit its usefulness. Cameras lowered into previous holes drilled into the mountain turned up no signs of the miners, and tests showed that oxygen levels in parts of the mine were too low to sustain human life.  Watch how the safety record at Murray's mines stacks up » . An effort to send rescuers through the collapsed mine tunnel to attempt an underground rescue was suspended last week, after a new cave-in killed three rescuers and injured six others. A panel of experts brought in to examine the mine after the second collapse determined that it was too unstable to resume the underground rescue. Both the mine owners and federal officials also ruled out trying to find the miners by lowering rescuers in a capsule through a hole drilled down into the mine, saying the dangerous maneuver wasn't justified absent any signs of life. The news was a blow to the family members of the missing miners, who have been holding out hope for a miracle and criticized Murray for not at least trying the rescue capsule. Signs reading ""Bring them home"" and ""Bob Murray keep your promise"" were posted overnight at the rescuers' command post. Kuzar said he met with the miners' families Wednesday, ""and they're holding up very well."" ""They're very strong people,"" he said. Earlier Wednesday, in an interview with CNN, Murray said plans were under way to establish a memorial for the missing miners at the site after the mine is closed. ""We're already discussing how we might go about to honor the trapped miners and make this a site for perpetuity,"" he said. Friends and family have identified the six missing miners as Luis Hernandez, Manuel Sanchez, Kerry Allred, Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips and Don Erickson.

"The boss of HSBC was last night facing questions over his secretive tax affairs after claiming he sheltered money in a Swiss bank account to prevent prying colleagues from finding out his bonus. Speaking publicly for the first time since revelations about HSBC’s Swiss private bank, Stuart Gulliver described his ‘shame’ at allegations that the lender routinely helped clients including arms dealers and blood diamond smugglers evade taxes. But he was also forced to defend his own finances after leaked documents revealed he sheltered some £5million in bonuses in an HSBC account in Switzerland under the name of a Panamanian company. Leaked files reportedly show that Stuart Gulliver (pictured), chief executive since 2011, held £5million in the bank's Geneva-based subsidiary that was at the centre of a huge tax avoidance scandal . This lasted from 1998 until 2011, when he became chief executive and his pay details had to be published anyway. Last night one accountant described the complex arrangement in Switzerland as a ‘classic case of tax avoidance’. The HSBC boss was also facing questions after revealing that he is domiciled in Hong Kong for tax purposes despite being born in Derby and living in the UK. Mr Gulliver, 55, said the computer systems on the trading floor enabled staff to find out how much their colleagues were being paid in bonuses. As he was often the best paid employee at the bank, he said he was particularly keen to stop this happening and set up a Swiss bank account to keep his pay secret. Mr Gulliver added that he used the Panama structure purely to prevent colleagues in Switzerland finding how much he was being paid. The revelation comes after leaked documents from HSBC Private Bank in Switzerland (pictured) between 2005 and 2007 showed it had helped the rich and famous avoid millions in tax . He said there was ‘no tax advantage’ and declared that he has paid full UK tax on his earnings since moving from Hong Kong to London with HSBC in 2003. Springing to his defence, the bank’s chairman, Douglas Flint, said: ‘There is absolutely no story here. There is nothing that Stuart has done that is not absolutely transparent, legal and appropriate.’ Seeking to justify his tax status, Mr Gulliver said he had spent the majority of his 35-year career at HSBC in Hong Kong and plans to return there when he steps down from the bank. Businesses are expected to behave better than the armed forces and the church, HSBC’s chief executive complained yesterday. Expressing his exasperation with regulators, Stuart Gulliver said: ‘We seem now to be holding publicly listed companies to a different standard than we might hold the armed forces, the church or any large organisation. ‘It seems to be a notion that Douglas [HSBC chairman Douglas Flint] and I should know what every single one of our 257,000 staff is doing all day long. That isn’t normally how large organisations can run.’ HSBC has been criticised as being ‘too big to manage’ after a series of scandals flared up on Mr Gulliver’s watch. It was fined £1.2billion by US regulators in 2012 after lax controls meant it became the ‘bank of choice’ for Mexican drug cartels wanting to launder money. It was also fined £400million by UK and US authorities last November for rigging the £3.5trillion a day foreign exchange market. David Buik from broker Panmure Gordon said: ‘Mr Gulliver may be right that companies are being held to higher standards. But to complain about it does sound a bit rich given the litany of misdemeanours at banks. They have brought it on themselves.’ ‘I would expect to die abroad,’ he added. But the comments received short shrift last night. Richard Murphy, a tax accountant, said he was ‘astonished’ that HM Revenue & Customs has allowed Mr Gulliver to remain domiciled in Hong Kong despite the fact that he has lived in the UK for the past 12 years. ‘Being paid in a Swiss bank account via a company is a classic case of tax avoidance,’ he said. ‘But the big question is how on earth a man can leave the UK at the age of 21, come back 12 years ago and remain permanently domiciled in Hong Kong. I am astonished this has been accepted by the HMRC. ‘There are clearly advantages to this arrangement. Among other things it allows Mr Gulliver to avoid inheritance tax.’ Although there is no suggestion that Mr Gulliver has done anything illegal, the spotlight on his personal finances comes as HSBC is under scrutiny over allegations that its private Swiss bank helped clients evade taxes. Yesterday Mr Gulliver said the wrongdoing was a ‘source of shame and reputational damage to HSBC’. Despite this he received a £7.6million pay package last year, including a £1.3million bonus. This was a drop from his £8million package in 2013 – his bonus was cut by £500,000 to reflect other wrongdoing at the bank. HSBC said its profits fell by 17 per cent last year to £12.2billion, while the bonus pool was cut from £2.6billion to £2.4billion.","Stuart Gulliver's bonuses allegedly paid via Panama-registered company .

"The tech firms are investing in rival efforts to beam the internet down to the ground from flying objects in the stratosphere - twice as high as aeroplanes normally fly.
Facebook aims to build a network of laser-beaming drones that will tightly circle known black-spots.
Google also has a drone project about which it's tight-lipped.
But the company is more open about an attempt to send ""strings"" of giant balloons circumnavigating the globe to provide persistent data links to the parts of the planet they pass.
The schemes may both seem far-fetched.
But the brains behind both companies' efforts told the BBC they are convinced they have a real shot at connecting the 57% of the world's population still offline.
Of the two projects, Facebook's plan is arguably at an earlier stage.
""It has not flown yet, that's the next milestone,"" the social network's engineering chief Jay Parikh acknowledges.
But he says he hopes the first drone will be airborne before the year's end.
""Don't tell Mark I said that,"" he hurriedly adds, referring to Facebook's chief executive.
""I'm trying to manage Mark's expectations.""
The aircraft is called Aquila 1 and was recently built in Somerset, England before being shipped to a secret test site.
The drone is wider than a Boeing 737 jet but looks quite different, since there's no need to carry passengers or a pilot.
The sleek giant structure is made of a thin layer of foam covered in carbon fibre, with four propellers attached.
""The whole structure is 142ft (43m) wide but weighs less than a Toyota Prius,"" Mr Parikh explains.
""The structure and stiffness of the plane is all in the carbon fibre of the wing and that supports everything, the [internet-providing] payload, the batteries, and the solar panels on top.""
The aim is to build a fleet of the drones with radio transmitters fitted underneath to beam  data across a 100 mile (160km) diameter zone below.
Terminals on the ground would use the signals to provide the internet to people's computers.
Facebook wants the drones to stay aloft for three months at a time.
That alone would be an impressive feat - the current record is about a fortnight.
But the really tricky bit involves creating a sky-high network with several drones acting as intermediary connection points, so that a fast connection sent from a city can be distributed outwards to the final aircraft in the chain as far as 300km (186 miles) away.
To help keep data speeds high, Facebook aims to beam lasers between the aircraft across significant distances.
""The analogy that we have come up with is this: If I took a US dime [18mm in diameter] and I walked 11 miles away from you, and then you had a laser in your hand, you would have to hit that dime,"" says Mr Parikh.
""And by the way, these are not stationary targets - these are moving.
""So, we have to do this and keep this pointed and connected while the one point and the other point are moving.
""It's pretty freaking hard.""
The firm has already trialled the tech in its California labs, but making it work 27km above ground will not be easy.
Project Loon's balloons have been taking to the skies since June 2013.
""We've flown almost 1,000 balloons at this point,"" Mike Cassidy, vice-president of Project Loon, tells the BBC.
""We've flown almost 20 million kilometres around the world.
""One of our balloons went around the world 19 times.""
The balloons travel with the winds, usually along an easterly or westerly latitude.
Google keeps each one on course by pumping helium in and out of a bag fastened inside the balloon's outer plastic envelope. This causes it to rise or fall, letting it find winds that will take it in the desired direction.
Rather than try to keep each balloon over one spot, Google's goal is to create a circular sequence. So, as one goes out of range of antennas on the ground, another takes its place, providing a continuous internet connection.
Initially, the firm struggled to keep its balloons aloft for much more than a week. But it now regularly keeps them aloft for 150 days.
""Even a millimetre-sized hole in a balloon will bring it down in a few days,"" explains Mr Cassidy.
""So, you need to study every phase of the process from manufacturing to packaging to shipping to launch.
""We just slowly found the holes by failure analysis.""
Rather than use lasers, Google relies solely on radio frequencies to transmit its data.
Equipment hanging below each aircraft connects to a base station in range below and then sends out the resulting data link to other antennas it can reach, which in turn link up to people's individual computing devices.
At present, Loon balloons can cover a circular area spanning 80km (50 miles) in diameter.
The balloons can also transmit signals to each other to extend the internet when there is no base station nearby.
The firm says it has already linked up two balloons more than 100km apart and transferred data at about 500 megabits per second.
But that's a fraction of the tens or even hundreds of gigabits per second rates Facebook believes its lasers are capable of.
""Radio technology is generally a more developed technology than freespace optical communication,"" Google's Mr Cassidy said, explaining his approach.
""It's been around longer, the components are typically less expensive.
""But we'll definitely look at all technologies that provide good performance.""
As both schemes advance and more equipment takes to the skies, the risk of an accident increases.
Even if Aquila weighs less than a car you still wouldn't want one hurtling towards you or a passenger jet at speed.
Mr Parikh, however, is quick to stress there is no imminent risk.
""This thing is not yet certified to fly over people's heads,"" he says.
""We will have to do thousands or tens of thousands of fight hours, induce failures, see how these things manage the stress, the [cold] temperature, all of that.""
But Google's balloons are already active.
Indeed, the firm hopes to start providing connections to early adopters in Indonesia and Sri Lanka soon.
""We put transponders on all our balloons, which is not required,"" says Mr Cassidy, ""so, just like an aeroplane, air traffic control can always see where the balloons are.""
But he acknowledges, things do not always go according to plan.
""We have had some balloons come down at a time earlier than we expected,"" he discloses.
""But in all those cases we did steer them to an area that was safer to land [and] contact air traffic control to co-ordinate the descent.""
Assuming life-threatening collisions can be avoided, one expert agreed both projects had  potential, not least because they should prove much cheaper than sending up more satellites or other existing alternatives.
""They are talking about co-operating with existing communications service providers, which convinces me they won't be Wild West kinds of projects,"" says William Hahn from the tech consultancy Gartner.
""We are seeing more options in a number of different areas as well: we have lower Earth-orbit satellites than we used to have and the cost of optical fibre is coming down.
""But there are still some very large populations that are hard to reach and hard to serve, and at least in the mid-term I think these new schemes could be part of the solution.""
That just leaves the problem - how do you work out where best to deploy all this gear?
No-one is suggesting the drones or balloons could provide blanket access.
But at present, even the best internet coverage maps break down when you zoom in close enough.
Facebook believes its artificial intelligence division could have the solution.
""The team has just developed deep expertise at image recognition,"" reveals Facebook's Mr Parikh.
""We've adapted that technology to be able to take in high-resolution satellite imagery and then be able to process it understanding what human dwellings look like.
""So, here's a building, here's a home, here's a teepee, here's a train, here's a car - whatever it is, we are now able to come up with a way of better understanding where these people are.""
The social network has not made its data public yet.
And like much else involved with the two connectivity projects, a lot has to be taken on trust at this point.
But both Google and Facebook have a big financial incentive to get more people online and a willingness to keep spending until they achieve it.
""Our philosophy is to do lots and lots of testing,"" concludes Google's Mr Cassidy.
""If your choice is to sit around for a year or two planning and design and then do one big test, then the test may or may not work.
""We like rapidly iterating, and I think from an engineering perspective that's the fastest way to get to a working system.""
Mr Parikh will provide more details about Facebook's drone at a meeting later this Wednesday, and will feature on Friday's edition of Tech Tent on BBC World Service",The sky is going to become a busier place if Facebook and Google get their way.
"The co-founder of pre-Facebook social network Plaxo has been charged with murdering his ex-wife's new husband. Minh Nguyen, 38, allegedly shot Corey Mattison two months after he married Denise Nguyen, having broken into the new couple's townhouse in Ashburn, Virginia. Two of Nguyen's three children with Denise were present at the time of the shooting at 9.30pm on Thursday, police said.

"It may be a foregone conclusion in the minds of many that accused Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is guilty of murder.  A horrific crime: multiple killings, including that of a child, and more than 200 maimed or wounded. What may be less clear is Tsarnaev's role in the attack, and whether, if convicted, he will be sentenced to death. As both sides prepare for his November trial, court filings and arguments by prosecutors and the defense provide a glimpse into their opposing strategy for the penalty phase of the case. The government says it has video showing Tsarnaev placing a backpack near the finish line, then using his cell phone, moments before the first bomb went off. He walked away and the second bomb went off in front of the camera, officials say. There is also the note Tsarnaev scribbled on the boat he was hiding in, claiming the Boston Marathon victims were payback for U.S. wars in Muslim lands. Excerpts of the note open the grand jury indictment.  ""I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished;"" Tsarnaev wrote.  ""We Muslims are one body, you hurt one, you hurt us all;"" ""Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam but due to said (unintelligible) it is allowed;"" and ""Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop."" In seeking the death penalty, prosecutors cite as an aggravating factor Tsarnaev's ""betrayal of the United States.""  They claim that after Tsarnaev received asylum from the United States, the defendant ""enjoyed the freedoms of a United States citizen; and then betrayed his allegiance to the United States"" by killing and maiming its people. Leading the defense team is Judy Clarke, a longtime public defender who has represented some of the nation's most notorious criminals, including ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski, who killed three; Jared Loughner, who shot and killed six people and critically wounded Rep. Gabby Giffords; and Susan Smith, the emotionally disturbed mother who drowned her two children. Kaczynski and Loughner pleaded guilty and were sentenced to life imprisonment. In the Smith case, Clarke argued that her client's abusive childhood and depression tormented her, causing her to ""snap.""  Although it convicted Smith of murdering her sons, the jury spared her life. ""She enjoys a wonderful reputation, she fights very hard for all her clients,"" said former U.S. attorney David Kelley, who prosecuted terrorism cases in New York's Southern District.  ""She's the model for all defense lawyers."" Humanizing Tsarnaev is a priority for his defense team, said David Hoose, a criminal defense lawyer who represented Kristen Gilbert, a former Veterans Administration nurse convicted of killing four patients.  The jury in that case did not vote unanimously to impose the death sentence.  Gilbert was thus sentenced to life in prison. ""There's always a story to be told, "" Hoose said.  ""It's not a story that excuses or justifies what was done. but it explains and allows us to understand as human being to human being what led someone to the point in their life where they could undertake such an act that virtually everyone else finds incomprehensibly horrible."" The defense has great leeway in presenting its case for the penalty phase.  ""The Supreme Court has held that pretty much anything related to the defense background, or character, or to the circumstances surrounding the crime"" is admissible, Hoose said. Hoose said he believes Tsarnaev, who was 19 when the crime happened, has a good chance of avoiding the death penalty. ""This is a young kid, still impressionable, only a year and a half over the minimum that he would have to be even to be eligible for the death penalty, who is clearly under the influence of an older brother who has been radicalized and who has become extremely violent.  What do you do as a younger sibling when that kind of thing is going on in your family?"" In a recent court filing, the defense lawyers sought information prosecutors obtained from the federal government's surveillance of Tamerlan Tsarnaev.  ""Any evidence tending to show that Tamerlan supplied the motivation, planning and ideology behind the Boston Marathon attack, and that his younger brother acted under his domination and control, is material,"" the defense argued. Tsarnaev's defense team declined to comment to CNN, but in a status hearing this week, they called the Tsarnaev family dynamic key to their case.  ""If the government indictment is true, this is about a family,"" defense attorney David Bruck said.  The defense objects to having an FBI agent monitor conversations between Tsarnaev and his siblings during prison visits.  Judge George O'Toole has indicated he agrees with the defense, but deferred ruling to give prosecutors time to respond. Since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, three people have been executed: Timothy McVeigh, for the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people; Juan Garza, for three murders connected to drug trafficking; and Louis Jones, for the kidnapping and murder of a female soldier. According to the Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel Project, juries have handed down 74 death sentence verdicts since the death penalty was reinstated.  However, a judge has formally applied the sentence only 71 times.  The disparity comes from defendants' convictions that were overturned or death verdicts that were vacated before formal sentencing by the judge. The liberal-leaning nature of Boston-area juries also will bear watching in Tsarnaev's case.  Massachusetts banned the death penalty in 1984.   Hoose said in an area that is heavily Catholic, many are inclined to follow the lead of Pope Francis, who opposes capital punishment. In a Boston Globe poll taken in September, 57% of Boston respondents supported a life sentence for Tsarnaev.  Thirty-three percent favored the death penalty. Lillian Campbell, whose granddaughter, Krystle Campbell, was killed in the marathon bombings, told CNN's Chris Cuomo, ""When they came out with this part about the death sentence ... I said, well, I don't really care what they do with them.  Because whatever they do, it's not going to bring her back,"" she said. ""I'll never forget her, ever, no matter how much they say.  Or what they do with the guy who did it. So I wouldn't wish anyone dead.  I wouldn't.""  ""Even after what he did?"" asked Cuomo. ""Even after what he did,"" Campbell replied. Prosecutors in the case declined to speak with CNN. Former federal prosecutor Allison Burroughs said, given the nature of the crime, it's not surprising the government is seeking the death penalty.  ""If not in this case, then when?"" Burroughs said. However, she said winning a death penalty verdict in Massachusetts is so unlikely it may not be worth the time and resources involved. Others say the government made the right decision. ""The death penalty attaching to a case of terrorism where people are maimed and killed is certainly a reasonable option,"" said Gerry Leone, the former Middlesex County District Attorney who prosecuted ""shoe-bomber"" Richard Reid in 2002.  Reid pleaded guilty before going to trial. Although Leone said he thinks the defense has a chance of beating the death penalty, the prosecution strategy should be clear. ""The prosecution keeps harping on and keeps drilling home the facts. And the facts are horrible here.  Two-hundred-sixty plus people who were hurt and maimed.  Three people dead.  A police officer in the aftermath of those actions executed,"" Leone said.  ""The government will keep pounding home the facts in this case, which are just horrible from a human perspective."" Richard Burr, who represented Timothy McVeigh, knows what it is like to lose a capital case.  McVeigh was executed in 2001. ""In any case where there is huge public injury, there's pressure on political leaders to seek the death penalty. There may be pressure on jurors to return a death penalty, even against their better wisdom."" The key, Burr said, is to present the jurors with a detailed narrative of the defendant's life that can evoke some mercy.  ""Clarke and her team are masters at getting at a defendant's life story,"" Burr said.  Yet ""she is also attuned to the critical need for the capital defense team not to ignore the victims."" ""The death penalty deprives people of their humanity,"" Burr added.  ""We have to try to help remind everybody that we're all in this together.""","Tsarnaev is accused of killing three in Boston Marathon bombing .

"Shoppers could be told how their meat has been killed, with labels on the packaging informing them over whether the animal was 'stunned' or 'unstunned', a government minister has suggested. George Eustice, the Parliamentary under-secretary of state for farming, food and the marine environment, suggested labels such as 'stunned' on the packaging would give a 'clear definition' to consumers. It comes amid an ongoing row about halal meat and the way it is packaged and presented to customers. Scroll down for video . George Eustice (pictured), the Parliamentary under-secretary of state for farming, food and the marine environment, said labels informing consuemrs over how the animal was killed could give 'clear definition' In May, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg demanded better labelling of meat and suggested suppliers used a designated 'halal' logo. It also emerged that major supermarkets such as Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Waitrose and Marks and Spencer were selling the imported meat, while popular restaurant chains such as Pizza Express had been serving halal chicken without making it clear on the menu. Halal meat comes from the traditional Muslim method of slaughtering but is controversial because animals are killed by having their throats cut and then having their blood drained. The European Commission is set to report early next year on whether meat sold in the European Union should be labelled. But Mr Eustice suggested this week that meat products could be labelled 'stunned' or 'unstunned, which would effectively alert shoppers as to whether their meat was killed according to religious guidelines. According to The Telegraph, Mr Eustice told MPs: '[Backbenchers have] made the point that it would be wrong just to label meat as 'stunned' or 'unstunned', and that a fairer way would be to list all the different methods of slaughter. 'The only thing I would say in response is that, from the EU perspective, 'stunned' has a clear legal definition in the legislation, and it is simply that an animal is rendered insensible to pain almost immediately.' Mr Eustice has suggested labels such as 'stunned' or 'unstunned' for meat packaging, to give customers clear information over whether the meat is halal (pictured) or non-halal and suitable under religious guidelines . He also said it would be 'difficult' to brand meat products either kosher or halal because 'there is no single definition of halal' and that a 'further complication is that not all meat slaughtered by kosher methods is deemed kosher'. And he added that it would be complicated to list all of the different methods of slaughter, and said there may not be a 'huge consumer appetite' to do so. HALAL . Halal slaughtering involves cutting through the large arteries in the neck with one swipe of a blade, while a Muslim butcher recites a religious verse. All blood is then drained away since the consumption of blood is forbidden under Islamic law. Under Islamic law, an animal must be slaughtered by having its throat cut while it is conscious. NON-HALAL . In comparison, the non-halal method involves taking animals to an abattoir where they are stunned before being killed. It means the animal is unconscious when it is killed and has an instantaneous death, as opposed to enduring what animal rights activists claim is drawn-out pain and suffering. Once the animal has been killed at the abattoir, it is removed and taken to be hung and butchered. KOSHER . According to the laws, in order for a meat to be kosher it must come from an animal that is ruminant and have split hooves. Ruminant animals chew food once and swallow, before regurgitating it and chewing again. Before slaughtering, the animal must be healthy and uninjured and a sharp knife is used to slice through the main arteries and windpipe, causing a drop in blood pressure that causes the animal to lose consciousness. Huw Irranca-Davies, the shadow environment minister, said the labelling of meat had been 'roundly and rightly rejected' by MPs last year. However, he said that if all different types of slaughter should be labelled then 'make room on the label for slaughter by electrical current, or by carbon dioxide, inert gas, captive bolt pistol, gunshot or free bullet and so on.' 'Some advocate doing so, and it would certainly satisfy the need for transparency,' he added. The row over the labelling of halal meat was sparked in May when it emerged millions of people were being sold halal and kosher meat without being told. Several restaurants such as Pizza Express, KFC and Subway were found to be selling halal meat – mainly chicken – without printing the information on menus. Chains including Domino's, GBK, Nando's, KFC, Ask and Slug & Lettuce also admitted to using halal meat in some dishes, mainly chicken, and locations. At least ten top higher education establishments - including Oxford University and the University of Manchester – were also found to be secretly serving up meat from potentially unstunned animals. In Manchester, 85 per cent of all meat served was found to unlabelled halal meal, while all the chicken served at universities in Sheffield and Exeter - which is halal - was not marked as so. Cardiff and Lincoln were also found to be among the universities serving significant quantities of the meat, without telling consumers. It also emerged that most of the major supermarkets were selling New Zealand lamb killed according to halal ritual without providing labels. The switch to slaughtering animals in line with Islamic ritual helps supermarket chains save money because the end product can be eaten by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Both halal and kosher slaughter involve a religious ritual in which the throat is cut. But some animals are not stunned beforehand, which is said to leave them in pain. The ongoing row about halal meat and the way it is packaged and presented to customers was sparked in May, after it was revealed millions of people were being sold halal and kosher meat without being told (file picture) In conventional slaughterhouses, cows, sheep and chicken are stunned, usually with an electric shock, to ensure they are unconscious before their throats are cut. This is said to minimise their suffering. After it emerged that halal was widely sold unknowingly to consumers, Mr Clegg demanded better labelling of meat. He said that while he personally had 'no problem' eating halal meat, produce should be clearly labelled because 'consumers want to know more about how the food arrived on their plate.'

"(CNN)The death of a 14-year-old shot by police just blocks from his school is the latest flashpoint as political tensions mount in Venezuela and pockets of anti-government protests erupt throughout the country. Kluibert Roa Nuñez, a high school student, was killed Tuesday when he got caught between protesters and national police in the western city of San Cristobal. A police officer fatally shot Kluibert, officials say. The government and the opposition alike have condemned the teen's killing, but Venezuela's recent history of violence and sharp political polarization hang over this shooting. Already protesters opposed to President Nicolas Maduro's government are pointing to the teen's death as a fresh rallying cry. And Maduro has blamed protesters for the violence that led to the shooting. A year ago, San Cristobal was the birthplace of anti-government protests that spread nationwide. The standoffs between security forces and protesters lingered for weeks and became violent, with more than 40 deaths, according to the government. Three witnesses at Tuesday's protest said that Kluibert was not a protester and had inadvertently come across the confrontation after leaving school. Vivian Nuñez, the slain teen's mother, told CNN en Español her son was walking four blocks from his school when a riot broke out around him. The protesters -- mostly students from a nearby university -- were running from police at the moment that Kluibert walked into the area, according to the witnesses, who spoke with CNN en Español. The teen tried to protect himself by ducking under a car but suffered a direct shot from an officer's firearm, the witnesses said. CNN has not independently confirmed how the shooting unfolded. The governor of the state of Tachira, where San Cristobal is located, declined to comment on his government's version of events. The teen's death sparked several protests around the country Wednesday. In Caracas, demonstrators outside the justice ministry held up notebooks smeared with red paint to symbolize the blood of the country's youth they say has been spilled. ""A bloody notebook. This is what we, the students, have -- ideas,"" protester Hilda Rubi said. ""We say to Mr. Nicolas Maduro, 'Are you afraid of the students? These are our weapons: a notebook, pens, thoughts and ideology.' "" The Venezuelan government responded quickly to the killing, detaining and identifying the national police officer who shot the teen. The interior ministry named Javier Mora Ortiz, 23, as the shooter. Attorney General Luisa Ortega Díaz announced Wednesday that Mora is formally charged with intentional homicide, and that nine protesters were also arrested in San Cristobal. Interior Minister Carmen Melendez, speaking on state television, vowed that the officer would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. She appealed for calm, asking students to remember the 43 deaths recorded in clashes last year. The police has been reformed since then, she said, calling the national police force a ""protector of human rights."" ""This is an isolated incident that does not represent the behavior of the new, humanist police,"" Melendez said. To protesters, and to the family of the slain teen, these comments seem to be insincere, or outright lies. Erick Roa, the father of the slain teen, told CNN en Español's Fernando del Rincon that he wants the full weight of the law to be applied to the officer but is not comforted by the government's actions. The officer's quick confession might be part of a strategy to get a lenient sentence, Roa said. He is afraid the justice system will go easy on Mora because he is a police officer. ""This was a murder; this was a homicide committed by this man, and he should pay with the full weight of the law,"" he said. The father also questioned the government's claims of what kind of projectile killed his son. The interior minister said Mora shot Kluibert with a shotgun loaded with rubber pellets. Roa said that if the weapon was indeed a shotgun, it was loaded with lead pellets, not rubber. The coroner's report said that a firearm caused the fatal wound, without detailing whether it was rubber or lead pellets, the father said. The government also said that police provided first aid to the injured teen, something that witnesses deny. Roa pleaded for police to ""be guardians"" while on duty, saying he hopes another child won't become a victim. The fury over Tuesday's shooting echoes the arguments made by pro- and anti-government groups in the past. Maduro framed the boy's death around the actions of the protesters in San Cristobal. He described a group of ""hooded youths"" who were ""being violent,"" beating police and pelting officers with rocks before police responded with force. Critics of the government turned to one of their most powerful tools -- social media -- to accuse the security forces of abuses and to share photos they say back their allegations. Tweets were tagged with #SOSVenezuela, #PrayForVenezuela and #MaduroAsesinoDeEstudiantes, literally accusing the President of killing students. Government supporters tweeted under the banner #ApoyoRotundoAMaduro, or ""complete support for Maduro."" All this turmoil comes during an economic crisis in oil-rich Venezuela. Venezuelans have endured years of shortages of basic goods, products and services. Consumers have to stand in line for hours for staples such as milk, chicken and cornmeal. Even toilet paper and condoms are scarce. Venezuela's currency, the bolivar, is overvalued. The official exchange rate is 6.3 per dollar, but dollars are being exchanged in the black market at 190-to-1 creating all kinds of problems for foreign companies, including American ones. Last week, the mayor of Caracas, Venezuela's capital and largest city, was arrested and accused of plotting to overthrow Maduro's government. In fragile economy, Venezuela arrests opposition figures: Why you should care . Mayor Antonio Ledezma, one of the opposition's most visible leaders, was arrested in a raid by federal agents. The opposition says the mayor's arrest is an attempt to divert attention from the country's economic woes. CNN's Kay Guerrero, Miguel Escalona and Catherine E.

"By . James Slack for the Daily Mail . Foreign criminals have been rounded up from Britain’s ‘soft’ open jails and put back behind bars to stop them absconding. Over the past 48 hours, more than 20 offenders were moved back to closed conditions. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has now imposed a ban on foreign convicts who are subject to deportation orders being placed in open jail. More than 20 offenders were moved from open jails and back to closed conditions to stop them absconding . They will also be barred from taking part in Release on Temporary Licence, whereby inmates can leave a jail in the daytime to find work or undergo rehabilitation because a string of prisoners have failed to return. The move will affect hundreds of foreign prisoners. There are some 800 awaiting deportation. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘We are working hard to return foreign national prisoners to their own countries to serve their sentences. While they remain with us, we must do all we can to make sure they stay safely under lock and key. ‘That’s why I am changing the rules to prevent those foreign nationals who are going to be deported from being transferred into open prisons or getting temporary release. ‘It’s clearly not right that foreign nationals who are going to be deported end up in open prisons where they might abscond and threaten public safety.’ Figures published last month showed a sharp rise in the number of inmates going missing from jail – in the past year there were 225, up almost 30 per cent over the past two years. This included 137 from open prisons, which have been the subject of controversy after a spate of criminals walked out. The most high-profile was Michael Wheatley, known as the ‘Skullcracker’, who sparked a nationwide hunt after absconding from HMP Standford Hill on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (pictured) has imposed ban on foreign convicts subject to deportation orders . Officials say the number of foreign criminals who have walked out is around 10 over the past five years. It comes amid renewed controversy over the Government’s record. On Monday, the Mail revealed how the number of overseas inmates escaping deportation rocketed by 50 per cent last year. In total, only 1,310 of the 4,030 overseas convicts considered for removal were sent home. The offenders who were not thrown out last year included 15 murderers, five people guilty of manslaughter, 15 rapists, 140 robbers and 20 people guilty of sex offences against children. The foreign convicts are now avoiding deportation in one in every three cases – a sharp increase on previous years.","More than 20 offenders have been moved from open jails to closed prisons .

"(CNN)Phylicia Rashad says she was misquoted. She says she wasn't being dismissive of the women who've accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault when she came to the comedian's defense in an online interview. ""I am a woman. I would never do that,"" she said on ABC's ""World News Tonight With David Muir"" on Wednesday. 'Forget these women' Rashad played Clair Huxtable, Bill Cosby's TV wife, on the groundbreaking NBC sitcom ""The Cosby Show."" Cosby's now been accused of harassing, drugging and sexually assaulting multiple women. And in an interview with Showbiz 411, Rashad said she never saw any indication of the behavior that the women have attributed to Cosby. ""Forget these women,"" Rashad is quoted as telling the outlet. ""What you're seeing is the destruction of a legacy. And I think it's orchestrated. I don't know why or who's doing it, but it's the legacy. And it's a legacy that is so important to the culture."" Fast forward to Wednesday night. Rashad says the Showbiz 411 piece didn't accurately reflect what she said -- especially the ""forget these women"" part. ""That was a misquote. That is not what I said,"" Rashad said. ""What I said is, 'this is not about the women. This is about something else. This is about the obliteration of legacy.' "" In a Wednesday post, Roger Friedman, the columnist who wrote the Showbiz 411 article, denied that he misquoted Rashad, but wrote that he understands how her words were taken out of context. ""She didn't mean for it to be taken the way it was, and I should have punctuated. There was NEVER the meaning in 'Forget those women' that she was saying to actually forget or dismiss then."" He continued, ""She meant, 'those women aside' -- as in, she's not talking about that, she's talking about Cosby's legacy being destroyed. It was conversational. Somehow this got twisted. I am really sorry if the way I presented it made it seem like either one of us was forgetting anyone."" Allred calls Rashad out . In coming to the defense of her TV husband, Rashad has now waded into a controversy that continues to dog Cosby. More than 20 women have come forward with claims, and a defamation lawsuit has been filed against Cosby. On Wednesday, attorney Gloria Allred brought out three more women -- Linda Kirkpatrick, Lynn Neal and a woman who chose to be identified only as Kacey -- who say they were sexually assaulted by the comedian after being drugged by him. While introducing the women, Allred addressed Rashad's statements to Showbiz 411. ""Phylicia, you should be supporting these women rather than joining Cosby's paid 'attack dogs' who are trying to undermine them in any way that they can,"" Allred said. Cosby stays mum . And Cosby? He's maintaining his silence -- as he's done while his reputation suffers. He was in Kitchener, Ontario, on Wednesday night for a standup appearance. A few dozen protestors rallied outside, but the show went on without a hitch. Larger protests are planned for Thursday night's shows. After his set, Cosby released a statement thanking attendees. ""I would like to personally thank you for giving me the opportunity to bring laughter back into your lives tonight,"" he said.  Also, I would like to applaud all of you and give you a standing ovation for respecting yourselves, the theatre (Centre In The Square) and the event organizers that produced a spectacular show for the Kitchener Community.""

"By . James Rush . Created: . 11:18 EST, 3 March 2014 . An investment banker who claims a man with the same name stood in for him at his own wedding has failed in his attempt to avoid a big money divorce suit. Former top-earning UBS banker Amit Goyal, 36, told a judge his headhunter wife Ankita 'married another Amit Goyal' at a ceremony at a four star hotel. He said he was relaxing at home six hours away while the service was taking place. Amit Goyal (left), 36, told a judge his headhunter wife Ankita (right) 'married another Amit Goyal' at a ceremony at a four star hotel . The high-flying city couple, who lived at Canary Wharf, London, met on Indian dating site Shaadi.com. They were married on September 15, 2003, in the Indian city of Meerut - but Mr Goyal insists he was 'not present at the ceremony'. He claimed his 33-year-old wife could neither divorce him, nor claim any financial support, because they were never married in the first place. However, Judge Mark Everall QC granted Mrs Goyal a decree nisi last year after describing her husband as an 'unreliable' witness and ruling that 'there was a valid marriage between the couple'. Challenging that decision at the Court of Appeal, Mr Goyal pointed to a mysterious thumb print on his marriage certificate - and an absence of wedding photos - in a bid prove himself a bachelor. In his judgement, Judge Everall also said that Mr Goyal was £300,000 in debt - despite earning £185,000-a-year, plus bonuses, before he was made redundant. The Hotel Samrat Heavens, in the Indian city of Meerut, where the marriage between Ankita Goyal and Amit Goyal took place . His complaints were thrown out by the judge, who said he had 'no prospect' of blocking his wife's divorce petition. Mr Goyal met his wife on the Indian matrimonial website in 2003. He had then been accepted to study at the 'very prestigious' INSEAD business school in Paris, having worked in London since 2002, but agreed to meet his prospective bride back in his homeland. The pair became engaged three days after they met and a wedding was fixed for the following month with the consent of Mrs Goyal’s senior army officer father. Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Goyal said she was 'very happy' at the outcome which would have 'massive implications' for her future . 'Mrs Goyal and her parents were happy to go along with the plan. Mr Goyal was a well-educated young man with evidently good prospects in the well-paid world of international finance,' Judge Everall said in his ruling. He flew to New Delhi and his fiancee’s family arranged a 'short marriage ceremony', in advance of the full festivities, in order to speed along her French visa application prior to the couple’s flight to Europe. However, the banker asserted that his wife tied the knot with an imposter at Meerut’s luxury Hotel Samrat Heavens, claiming that he had been six hours’ away in his home town, Bathinda, on the morning of the nuptials. 'His case is that Mrs Goyal and he were not married on September 15, 2003; he was not present at any ceremony that may have taken place on that day. His case is that she married another man that day,' Judge Everall explained. Mr Goyal said this meant his subsequent 'marriage', celebrated just three days later, was invalid - even though the groom’s name on the wedding certificate for the previous ceremony matched his own. The pair moved to France and then the UK, before their daughter, now six, was born in 2007. But their relationship 'irretrievably broke down' and Mrs Goyal moved out of their Docklands home in 2011. Mr Goyal claimed that he had 'not read the certificate carefully enough' in 2003 and that the first time he noticed the discrepancies in the dates was more than a year after the relationship ended. Judge Everall heard expert evidence that a photograph, supposedly depicting the groom on the marriage certificate, was not of Mr Goyal, and a thumb print on the document, which was purportedly his, belonged to someone else. The expert also highlighted a number of 'oddities' about the registration of the marriage. 'Standing back and having regard to . all the evidence and Judge Everall’s reasoning, I do not detect that he . had any real difficulty in arriving at his conclusion. Indeed, . having regard to his finding that Mr Goyal’s evidence pointed to him . being unreliable, it seems to me that the conclusion to which he came . was, in reality, the only one which was open to him' - Lord Justice Kitchin . Nonetheless, the judge said that 'the overwhelming probability on all the evidence is that Mrs Goyal did not marry, and did not intend to marry, a different Amit Goyal on 15th September, 2003. 'Why should she do so? Why should she do this on September 15 and then marry Mr Goyal on September 18 and fly with him to France?' the judge asked. Mr Goyal was a 'highly educated and intelligent man' who had worked for Barclays, Deutsche Bank and UBS and who was 'precise and careful'. But the judge said of him: 'I did not find him a satisfactory witness'. Rejecting his claim that he did not check the marriage papers until long after the split, the judge said his evidence about that was 'unconvincing and implausible'. 'I find there was a valid marriage between Mrs Goyal and Mr Goyal on September 15, 2003, in Meerut, India,' the judge concluded, before formally ending their union. On appeal, Mr Goyal argued in person that it 'simply was not possible' that he could have made the ceremony in time, because he was in Bathinda at 9am on the day of the wedding. Pointing to the lack of wedding snaps, he said: 'Marriage is the one of the most sacred things in the Hindu religion. If you say to someone there is a marriage without photographs, it simply does not add up.' But Lord Justice Kitchin said: 'Standing back and having regard to all the evidence and Judge Everall’s reasoning, I do not detect that he had any real difficulty in arriving at his conclusion. 'Indeed, having regard to his finding that Mr Goyal’s evidence pointed to him being unreliable, it seems to me that the conclusion to which he came was, in reality, the only one which was open to him.' The judge concluded: 'I’m satisfied there is no prospect of success in this application. It must therefore be dismissed.' Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Goyal said she was 'very happy' at the outcome which would have 'massive implications' for her future.","Amit Goyal told judge his wife Ankita 'married another Amit Goyal'

"The glitch caused iPad software - used by the planes' pilots and co-pilots for viewing flight plans - to stop working.
The firm's cockpits went ""paperless"" in 2013 to save its staff having to lug heavy paperwork on board. AA estimated the move would save it more than $1.2m (Â£793,600) in fuel every year.
The company said that it was still investigating the cause of the problem.
""Some American Airlines flights experienced an issue with a software application on pilot iPads yesterday evening,"" a spokesman told the BBC.
""In some cases, the flight had to return to the gate to access a wi-fi connection to fix the issue.
""We apologise for the inconvenience to our customers and we had them on the way to their destinations soon afterwards.""
Serge Gojkovich, chief executive of car parking app-maker Curbstand, was among the passengers affected.
He tweeted that his San Francisco-to-Los Angeles flight was only able to get airborne after the crew had printed off the maps they needed.
A spokesman for the airline was unable to confirm the report.
American Airlines is not the only carrier whose pilots and cabin crew have switched from using physical charts and paper manuals to tablets.
United Airlines was also an early adopter of iPads, while Delta has opted for Microsoft's Surface tablets instead.
British Airways and Ryanair are among others still in the process of shifting to so-called Electronic Flight Bag-based systems.
In addition to saving on fuel costs, it is also suggested that such kit reduces flight preparation time, reduces the likelihood of injuries and helps staff by offering real-time updates.
There is competition between several firms to provide the software and support that make the technology possible.
American Airlines pilots use an app called FliteDeck, which is made by the Boeing subsidiary Jeppesen.

"By . Anna Edwards . Imomotimi Wilson treated his alleged victim 'like a piece of meat' A man on trial for rape for allegedly refusing to wear a condom on the third time he had sex with a woman in a one-night stand has told the jury it was 100 per cent consensual. Imomotimi Wilson, 30, met his alleged victim in a pub and she agreed to go back to his house but told him she would only have sex if he used protection. They had consensual sex twice but on the third occasion claims that Wilson failed to use a condom. The woman, a 40-year-old, said Wilson treated her 'like a piece of meat' as the alleged attack took place. She said he held her hands over her head and told her 'if you love me you'll do it' before raping her for 15-20 seconds. But giving evidence at his trial at Cambridge Crown Court Wilson said 'she said stop and that's when I stopped'. He said: 'She said I feel like having sex again and I said ""Yes, I feel like having sex with you as well again but there is no condom"". 'She was romancing me, touching and kissing, and I said no, I do not want to do that because there is no condom. 'She started kissing me again and then I penetrated her.

"But there are strict rules about their usage, which has led some to come up with innovative ways to fly such vehicles more safely.
""I'm using a dog leash for a small dog,"" says roboticist Sergei Lupashin as he demonstrates a new kind of consumer-friendly drone at the Ted (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference in Vancouver.
By tethering it, he hopes the Fotokite, as it is called, can avoid some of the issues faced by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are banned without a special licence because of safety and privacy concerns.
""It doesn't rely on GPS [ Global Positioning System], sophisticated machine vision, radio, it doesn't even use a compass. Most crashes today happen because of GPS, radio or piloting issues,"" says Dr Lupashin.
""Should something happen, the leash gives a robust fail safe - the vehicle reduces thrust and it automatically comes back to the operator,"" he adds.
The inspiration for the device came during street protests in Bolotnaya Square in Moscow, when he realised it could be an invaluable tool for reporting protests around the world.
""For journalists it is good to get that perspective, to show the scale of the event without adding to the tension,"" says Dr Lupashin.
But he also sees potential for amateur and professional photographers, archaeologists, architects and even as a toy for children.
His prototype device uses a shop-bought quadrocopter with ""a basic action camera attached"" which, in turn, is connected to a standard dog lead. It can shoot both video and stills.
Drones have long been associated with the military, but increasingly they are finding their way into civilian life, for a wide range of uses including delivering medicines in the developing world, for farming and as a low-cost way of getting broadband to remote parts of the world - something both Facebook and Google are actively pursuing.
They are also useful tools for both professional and amateur photographers, providing the opportunity for a bird's eye view of people and places.
""Aerial photography is a fascinating new application for small, unmanned vehicles but the remote-controlled ones are very complex and can be difficult to use. They are also dangerous,"" says Dr Lupashin.
The safety issue took centre stage last month when an Australian triathlete was injured by an aerial drone taking pictures of the race she was competing in.
A drone on a lead is likely to be treated with far less suspicion, says Dr Lupashin.
""People treat you normally - it is like a flying pet. It always has a physical connection to the operator,"" he says.
The BBC, along with other news organisations, already uses drones for filming, but it is constantly looking to update its kit.
Andy Armstrong, a consultant looking at emerging broadcast technologies, recently tested the Fotokite for the BBC. Its ease of use and portability makes it useful for journalists in the field, he says.
""Anyone who's walked a dog without losing it can operate Fotokite,"" he adds, although he notes that ""to get really stable shots you need almost completely still air"".
Its lack of anonymity could also be a problem though.
""There are certain scenarios where you wouldn't want to attract that much attention,"" he says.
Jake Berger, a BBC programme manager, wanted a UAV that would be able to safely film aerial shots of the crowds at an open-air theatre show.
""The fact that Fotokite was tethered - flown on a retractable dog leash - meant it was suitable,"" he says.
""Unfortunately, the British weather confounded us on the day of the performance - it rained continuously for about six hours.
""This would have both blown the electronics on Fotokite and risked electrocution from lightning.""
Currently the use of commercial drones in the US is banned by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA). Anyone wishing to use one has to obtain a special licence.
The question of whether a tethered drone would be exempt from this is unclear.
According to Ben Gielow, general counsel for the Association for Unmanned Vehicles Systems Internet,  even a drone on a lead would be against the law.
He says the FAA told one company that wanted to fly a tethered drone that ""until we have new regulations in place, the only path for you to fly your aircraft in the National Airspace System (even tethered) is to obtain the special airworthiness certificate in the experimental category"".
Others though, who are developing similar tethered drones, say they have been told by the FAA that such UAVs would be exempt from current guidelines.
The reality is that, in the US at least, there are no clear rules yet about the use of UAVs, tethered or not.
""The FAA has been dragging its feet for four years and are now faced with an explosion of this technology. People can buy inexpensive, sophisticated systems off the internet and it doesn't have the resources to govern or control these unmanned aircraft,"" said Mr Gielow.
There are guidelines governing the use of model aircraft in the US -  they must always be:
This led the FAA to ban Texas-based search-and-rescue group EquuSearch from using a remote-controlled plane to help search for missing people.
In response the group has launched legal action challenging the validity of an FAA ban and similar cases are also going through the courts.
""Their frustration is that if they were using such an aircraft for fun it would be allowed but because they are using it for search and rescue it isn't,"" says Mr Gielow.
The lack of clarity about the use of UAVs has led to anger among US manufacturers who fear being left behind by other countries, such as the UK, France and Israel, which have much clearer guidelines regarding drone use.
The US Congress has given the FAA until 2015 to create such rules, and this month it opened its first test facility in North Dakota.
But, for the time being at least, it seems that much about the use of such unmanned flying vehicles remains up in the air.","Drones are becoming more common in our skies, performing a variety of tasks, from taking photos to monitoring crops and potentially even delivering broadband."
"Montreal's Olympic Stadium is known as the ""Big O,"" but for many of the city's taxpayers it is really the ""Big Owe."" ""It took us 30 years to pay it off and as a taxpayer I'm not too happy about it,"" said one Montreal resident, echoing the anger that many here still feel about the way the games were funded in 1976. ""It was not very well managed as a financial project. And we have a fabulous stadium, but I think it cost more than all the covered stadia in North America put together, "" said Dick Pound, former International Olympic Committee vice-president and a prominent resident of the Canadian city. However, Pound said calling the Montreal games of 1976 ""the bankrupt Olympics"" is a bad rap, and pointed out that the games actually made money. He said they paved the way for a new financial structure and the introduction of lucrative new television rights deals. People still come up to him and remember how well the Montreal games were staged and, in the end, how exciting they were, he added. ""They were pretty magic. All Olympics are magic but we had Comaneci with her first '10' and we had the Spinks brothers and we had Sugar Ray Leonard,"" he said. ""I mean we had some magnificent heroes of the modern Olympics."" But there is weariness in Montreal about being known for staging the Olympic games that almost bankrupted a city. The city's mayor at the time, Jean Drapeau, famously remarked that if the games end up having a deficit, men will have babies. And it was in large part due to the Olympic Stadium construction that the statement seems so ridiculous now.  The Olympic debt was nearly US$1.48 billion, and the stadium itself has been an engineering nightmare -- the retractable roof has struggled to worked properly over the years and almost forced the closure of the entire arena last year amid safety concerns. But the city's current government insists Montreal has put that legacy behind it and the Olympic stadium is now a key attraction. ""Now it is paid, and it's profitable for Montreal to keep it,"" said Manon Barbe, the councillor in charge of sports and leisure for the city. Barbe pointed out that the legacy of the games has created a sporting city that nurtures hundreds of elite athletes. ""Today Montreal has more than 1,000 elite athletics and more than 100 coaches. And if it's that high, it's not a coincidence. It is because we decided to keep most of our sporting facilities,"" said Barbe. One of those facilities is the Claude Robillard Sporting Center, an impressive training facility for more than a dozen sports that nurtures athletes of all ages. During the 76' games, the center hosted handball and water polo and was a training center for athletics, swimming and field hockey. Today, hundreds of aspiring athletes receive access to coaching and equipment, much of it subsidized by the city of Montreal. On most days you will find former Canadian Olympian Hank Palmer here on the track, either indoors or outdoors, or training in the pool or weights room. ""If I didn't have this center, I probably wouldn't be at the peak I am, I would not have the career I've been able to have,"" said the sprinter, who competed at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. ""This center really helped me develop myself, not only as a track athlete but an athlete in general because I have so many other sports around me. ""I can cross-train, do basketball, soccer, weight training, anything.""","The 1976 Montreal Olympics almost left the city bankrupt with its US$1.48 billion-price tag .
But former IOC vice-president Dick Pound said the games were hailed as a sporting success .
The city retained and invested in its sporting facilities long after the Olympics finished ."
"On Wednesday, a court in Thane, a Mumbai suburb, had convicted Girish Pote, 35, for the 2013 murder.
The prosecutors told the court that Pote killed his wife Madhuvanti Pathak and chopped her body into pieces.
The crime came to light after he telephoned relatives to confess to the crime and they informed the police.
In India, a life term generally ends in 14 years, but the Thane district court judge Mridula Bhatia said he would remain in jail for as long as he lived because of the ""gruesome"" nature of his crime.
Pathak held a French passport since her mother was from France.
The couple married on 20 June 2006 and lived in Mumbai's Bhayander area.
They had a two-year-old son, who was with Pote's parents at the time of the crime.
Police said Pote had attacked his wife with a knife.
They said the couple had been fighting over money and also because Pathak wanted to return to France.",An Indian man who murdered his French wife and hid her severed body in the refrigerator has been jailed for life.
"(CNN) -- In a bookstore, I saw a woman taking photograph after photograph of newly released titles that were arranged on a shelf. She was using her phone to take the pictures. I didn't understand. Why would anyone want to take pictures of books? Then, at a restaurant, waiting for a table, I heard two men, also waiting, talking. One said he had just ended a frustrating day at the store he owned. ""Do they think I'm a showroom?"" he said. He mentioned people who had come into his shop that day, had looked at the merchandise, had taken notes -- and then had left. ""Do they think I don't know what they're doing?"" he said. It is a relatively new phenomenon. Among retail merchants -- owners of stores both small and large -- it has a name: . ""Showrooming."" No one showrooms by choice. And it represents a potential sea change in American life. Its implications are vast. As described in an article by reporter Amy Zimmerman in the Wall Street Journal, showrooming is ""when shoppers come into a store to see a product in person, only to buy it from a rival online, frequently at a lower price."" Say a merchant owns a retail store -- a brick-and-mortar store, on a city street. He or she hires staff, pays rent, writes checks for electricity and telephone service, pays for janitorial work, pays real estate and sales taxes, invests heavily in merchandise. And hopes against hope that customers will come in, look around and buy something. This is how the retail sales business has always worked. But in recent years, as online companies without a single physical store have risen to prominence, something new has occurred. People will come into stores, look around, stop at items they particularly like -- and instead of carrying them to the cash register, will take photos of them, or type a description into their smartphones. Then, in many cases, they will go home, enter the product into a search engine and find some online-only merchant -- a merchant who has no real-life stores -- who is selling the item for less money. A tap of the ""Enter"" key, a few keystrokes to provide credit card information, and the item -- the item the person has examined and liked in the brick-and-mortar store -- is on its way to the buyer's home. It's all so effortless. The online merchant wins. The purchaser wins. Who loses? You know the answer. The loser is the owner of that real-life store: the person who has stocked the merchandise, hired the staff, paid to keep the store cool in summer and warm in winter, written the rent checks and the tax checks. It is no wonder merchants are feeling frustration and anger that their stores are being considered as little more than showrooms by some shoppers -- showrooms displaying merchandise that, if the people wandering the aisles go home and buy from an online vendor, will provide not a cent in revenue to the owner of the real store. Do the customers ever look into the eyes of the proprietor of the store and wonder if this new way is fair to him? As Brad Tuttle of Time magazine has written: . ""Most consumers don't really care how, or even if, a retailer makes money. All they care about is which one has the best products at the cheapest prices. The ideal situation is one in which they can inspect merchandise in person, and then buy it at the cheapest price without having to schlep it to and from the car, and without having to pay extra for delivery."" What's the difference, you may ask? Why does this matter? It will matter when and if critical mass is reached, and online-only merchants, who don't have to underwrite the expense of having traditional stores on city streets, reach dominance. Then, one by one, the stores that have unwillingly become showrooms for the online merchants will fold up. And the American downtown-and-mall landscape will begin to look barren. A doomsday scenario? Perhaps. But ""just browsing"" has taken on a different meaning in the context of shoppers who go home and use their computers' browsers to find online retailers who will undercut the conventional stores. Last weekend I was in central Ohio for the annual charity race we hold to raise cancer-research money in memory of my late friend Jack Roth. I asked his daughter, Maren, who owns a women's boutique called Rowe, whether she was familiar with the showrooming phenomenon. She said she has seen it with her own eyes, in her own store. ""If they tell you how much they like an item, and take a picture of it and then leave the store and you never hear from them again, it's a pretty good indication that they may be going home and looking for a better price online,"" she said. ""And if they call the store later and ask you to tell them the specific style name and number of the item -- then you really know. They're putting the merchandise they saw in your store into a search engine."" It's not just smaller merchants like Roth. Target, the retail-store giant, wrote a letter to its vendors this year that said, ""What we aren't willing to do is let online-only retailers use our brick-and-mortar stores as a showroom for their products and undercut our prices without making investments, as we do, to proudly display your brands."" What all this will eventually do to old-style stores is anyone's guess. Perhaps they will be judged to have outlived their usefulness. In the meantime, merchants will continue to open their doors each morning in the hopes that the people who come in will really intend to buy something. There is a longstanding axiom that business owners are supposed to believe in: ""The customer is always right."" But in this emerging era in which people come into stores taking photos and making lists, with no intention to give the store owner their business, worried merchants can't be blamed if they look around their shops and ask themselves: . Who, and what, is a customer? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: A new practice called' ""showrooming"" a threat to brick and mortar businesses .
He says shoppers take pictures of an item, or make notes, and then buy the item online instead .
He says running a store costly, how can merchants compete if shoppers ""showroom?""
Greene: Even big stores, like Target, worry. Showrooming may lead to stores' demise ."

"CNN senior international correspondent Nick Paton Walsh has won an Emmy award for outstanding writing for his reports filed from Syria and Afghanistan. The award-winning reports were ""Aleppo Airstrikes,"" ""Aleppo: Old City Fight,"" and ""Afghan Women Self-Immolation."" In its submission to the Annual News and Documentary Emmy Awards, CNN highlighted Paton Walsh's ""poetic writing,"" saying it contrasted ""with the sobering environments from which his stories are usually drawn."" ""His reports punch through the daily accounts of wounded and dead, and give us a fresh way to see the grinding pitilessness of war, and its quirky inconsistencies,"" the broadcaster said. ""Aleppo Airstrikes"" is the account of indiscriminate shelling in the Syrian city of Aleppo. Walsh's piece to camera sees him crouching as a government bomber jet flies above. ""It's that sound that terrifies ordinary residents of Aleppo daily,"" he says. Of the lone infant who survives the strike, Paton Walsh observes: ""A year old, he was born into Syria's bloody revolution, and may yet survive it still."" In ""Aleppo: Old City Fight,"" Paton Walsh goes right inside the fight for the historic old city. His report focuses on the improvised nature of the battle, with ""pot-shots at nothing in particular"" and what it could mean for the wider conflict. CNN said Paton Walsh's war reporting was ""complemented by his sensitive stories about the plight of women in the developing world."" In ""Afghan Women Self-Immolation,"" the correspondent reports on an epidemic of self-immolation among young married women in Herat. The women take the drastic measure as a form of protest against the abuse they suffer at the hands of their husbands or in-laws. CNN said Paton Walsh's ""delicate writing has a reverential tone, bestowing upon these sad burn victims in Herat the respect they seek."" Beirut-based Paton Walsh has worked for CNN since 2011, focusing on the Middle East, Afghanistan and surrounding region. He topped five other contenders to take home the award for outstanding writing at the awards ceremony, which was held in New York, Tuesday. More recently, Paton Walsh has reported from scenes of conflict in Egypt and Turkey and from Dagestan, where he secured an interview with the parents of the alleged Boston bombers. CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 also won an Emmy, for Outstanding News Discussion and Analysis for ""Kids On Race: The Hidden Picture,"" while CNN's 2012 U.S. election night coverage saw it honored with an Emmy for ""Outstanding Live Coverage of a Current News Story -- Long Form."" Paton Walsh's previous awards include the British Press Awards' Young Journalist of the Year in 2000 and Amnesty International's Gaby Rado Award (2006) for a reporter at the start of their career for his work in the former Soviet Union. He also won Amnesty's television award for his work in Sri Lanka in 2010, while he was working for British broadcaster Channel 4 News. Read more from Nick Paton Walsh: .

"A presenter on Radio Flaixbak contacted Mr Rajoy's office, pretending to work for Carles Puigdemont.

"Lib Dem Baroness Hamwee had asked if the £1 pay rate ""for people who have committed no crime"" was ""something that as a society we can be proud of"".
Baroness Williams of Trafford told the Lords the work by inmates was voluntary and was a way to ""relieve boredom"".
She said it helped meet ""recreational and intellectual"" needs - and was not a scheme designed to save money.
Baroness Williams, who faced jeers as she answered questions in the House of Lords,  argued that any rights detainees had to work were curtailed, so their pay rights were ""not the same as people who are not subject to immigration detention"".
Labour frontbencher Lord Rosser argued that a Freedom of Information request in May 2014 suggested that hundreds of detainees had been paid £45,438 for 44,832 hours work.
""The saving of using detainees for £1 an hour, compared to paying employed staff on minimum wage, would be in the region of £300,000 a month.
""Who gets the benefit of this apparently considerable saving each month by using detainees at immigration centres on just £1 an hour to do necessary work, as opposed to using employed staff on the minimum wage? Is it the government or is the firm running the centre who reap treat financial benefit?""
Baroness Williams insisted the work at immigration removal centres was not about supplementing contractors, who she said were obliged to provide a minimum number of opportunities for detainees to participate voluntarily in paid activities.
But after Lib Dem Lord Paddick received a similar reply, former Commons Speaker Lady Boothroyd pressed the minister: ""The question that's being asked is who benefits? That was the original question and that's the question we're all waiting to hear the answer.""
Lady Williams replied: ""Who benefits is the detainee.""
She said that ""this money is not wages as the ordinary working population would see it"", adding that the rate is ""being reviewed"" and a report is expected at the end of the year.","Detainees benefit from being able to work for £1-an-hour at immigration centres, a minister has insisted."

"(CNN) -- A body found near Lubbock, Texas, has been identified as that of a baby sitter seen in a motel surveillance video with a longtime family friend charged in the case, authorities said Wednesday. The medical examiner identified the remains found Monday about seven miles outside of the city as belonging to Elizabeth Ennen, 15. She had been strangled, Capt. Greg Stevens told CNN. Stevens told reporters that Humberto Salinas Jr., 45, was being held on a $250,000 bond on an aggravated kidnapping charge. Police are talking with the district attorney about taking a murder charge to the grand jury, he said. Elizabeth was reported missing after baby-sitting at a motel for Salinas, who was a friend of the Ennen family and the father of her boyfriend, police said. The girl did baby-sitting jobs several times for Salinas at the motel, where he lived, police said. Stevens would not say whether Salinas was cooperating, but he indicated the remains were not found by chance or through a tip. Elizabeth was reported missing January 5, and Salinas was charged in the case on Friday. Are you missing a loved one? Share your story . A relative of Salinas declined comment when contacted by CNN Wednesday. Stevens defended the time it took to conduct the investigation and arrest Salinas, saying the suspect was a family friend who deceived the family and police on the girl's whereabouts. But police believe Elizabeth was dead by the time they got a report that she was missing, Stevens said. ""They [the family] trusted this guy to speak ... to the officer,"" said the captain, who would not comment on a possible motive. Lily Huckabee, Elizabeth's aunt, told HLN's Nancy Grace that the girl's mother, Virginia, ""is holding on the best she can...."" Salinas was married and ""always presented himself very respectful,"" said Huckabee, who described Elizabeth as loving, caring, shy and interested in music. Police have a January 4 surveillance video of Elizabeth being taken from the Carriage House Inn, but they did not know of it when they began their investigation, Stevens told CNN. According to an arrest affidavit, the video shows Salinas holding the teen's arm and leaving the motel, he said. ""We believe he killed her while he was gone with her,"" Stevens said. Salinas went to Elizabeth's home and talked with her mother early January 5, police said. He helped her file an initial report, the captain said. According to that report, Salinas said he brought Elizabeth home from the motel and went back to get her purse. When he showed up at the house, the mother asked about her daughter's whereabouts. The suspect indicated Elizabeth might have left the neighborhood with his son, believed to be 18 or 19, Stevens said. ""He began misdirecting the investigation, leading it in the opposite direction of the truth,"" the officer said. Police initially classified the case as a runaway, but within days learned the son had a solid alibi. They began looking at the elder Salinas, who initially gave another location for the baby-sitting, said Stevens, adding police for much of the investigation believed Elizabeth had disappeared from her home. ""We came around 180 degrees,"" said Stevens, adding an investigator suggested they check with the Carriage House Inn on possible video. Officers saw the video on the same day they arrested the suspect, police said. Stevens defended his department from criticism on the time it took to make an arrest and find the body. ""These (type of cases) can often take years,"" he said. A candlelight vigil in Elizabeth's memory is scheduled for Thursday night at Monterey High School, where she attended, CNN affiliate KCBD in Lubbock reported. Her funeral is Friday. Diena Thompson, the mother of a girl found dead in a Georgia landfill, told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell she has issued financial assistance from the Somer Thompson Foundation to Elizabeth Ennen's mother. Thompson's daughter, Somer, was taken from her Florida neighborhood in October 2009. The child was raped and killed and her body left under a pile of trash.

Bangladesh need just 33 runs to seal their first Test win against England but have only two wickets left.
""It has been a fantastic game to play in,"" said Broad, who took 2-26 as Bangladesh chased a victory target of 286 in their second innings.
""Bangladesh have shown a huge amount of skill to get to needing 30,"" he added.
""We have shown character to stay in this game and will come out fighting.""
Broad began the day with bat in hand, but was run out in the second over and England were soon bowled out for 240.
The hosts replied with 253-8, with debutant Sabbir Rahman unbeaten on 59, before the umpires ended play for the day due to bad light.
""I am not sure many players will get much sleep tonight,"" Broad told BBC Test Match Special.
""Although the wicket has turned more than we expected from day one, it has been a very exciting game and both teams have played it very skilfully.""
The opening Test of the two-match series has already become notable for a world record number of decisions being reviewed, with 24 the current total.
""It has been a really interesting Test on the review front,"" Broad said.
""That added to the tension on the field. It has been two countries going hell for leather at each other with a lot of passion - that is what Test cricket is about.

""Hopefully, tomorrow morning we will get a bit of reverse. The spinners have tended to take wickets in the morning so it is a big decision for Cooky [England captain Alastair Cook] on who will open.
""It probably works in our favour. We will get some rest and come back fresher tomorrow. And a lot of wickets have fallen in the first hour of play. We are happy to take it into tomorrow.""

""We will not allow our students' exams to be disrupted and have made arrangements to make sure this does not occur.
""Of the staff that were placed at risk of redundancy as a result of restructuring in the School of Medicine, Medical Sciences and Nutrition, the remaining four have been offered alternative employment on their current salary and grade. As a result, we no longer believe there will be a need for any compulsory redundancies.
""Regarding the concerns of UCU over the process that was followed, it is important to point out that the University of Aberdeen is an equal opportunities employer and takes this responsibility very seriously.""",Members of the University and College Union (UCU) Scotland at the University of Aberdeen are to strike on Wednesday in a dispute over jobs.
"It may be banned for ordinary people in Iran, but Facebook has at least one member in the country. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appears to have become one of the website's newest members. Despite banning it due to its use by activists to rally government opponents in 2009, a page purporting to be for Khamenei himself launched a few days ago with the name Khamenei.ir. Ayatollah Khamenei has joined Facebook despite banning the rest of Iran from the site due to government opposition in 2009 . The 73-year-old's page displays pictures of him alongside speeches and pronouncements he has made. While there are several other Facebook pages already devoted to Khamenei, the new one - whose number of 'likes' was today close to 10,000 - appeared to be officially authorised, rather than merely the work of admirers. The page has been publicised by a Twitter account of the same name that Iran experts believe is run by Khamenei's office. Both U.S-based social media sites are blocked in Iran by a wide-reaching government censor but they are still commonly used by millions of Iranians who use special software to get around the ban. In 2009, social media were a vital tool for those Iranians who believed the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was rigged. Facebook was used to help organise street protests of a scale not seen since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. The protests - which the government said were fuelled by Iran's foreign enemies - were eventually stamped out by the security forces and their political figureheads remain under house arrest. The cover photo for the supreme leader shows Khamenei being driven through the streets with hundreds of supporters surrounding his vehicle . Another picture shows Khamenei alongside Imam Kohmeini in the first days of Iran's Islamic Revolution movement . Khamenei's Facebook page has so far shared a picture of a young Khamenei alongside the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in the early 1960s. It shares a similar tone, style and content with accounts devoted to disseminating Khamenei's message on Twitter and Instagram and to the website www.khamenei.ir, a sophisticated official website published in 13 languages. Experts said the social media accounts showed that Iran, despite restricting access to such sites inside the country, was keen to use them to spread its world view to a global audience. 'Social media gives the regime leadership another medium of communication, one that can share their message with a younger and far more international demographic,' said Afshon Ostovar, a Middle East analyst at CNA, a U.S.-based research organisation. Iran has yet to comment on whether Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has joined Facebook or not . Iran is locked in a decade-long dispute with the West over its nuclear programme, which the U.S. and its allies suspect is aimed at developing a bomb, something Iran has repeatedly denied. Iran, the West and regional states are also often opposed on issues such as the violence raging in Syria and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Iranian authorities have said they are trying to build a national intranet, something sceptics say is a way to further control Iranians' access to the global web. Tehran tried to block Google Inc.'s email service this year but soon reopened access. Iranian authorities had no immediate comment on the site, which apparently went online last week but only recently gained prominence among social media watchers. Despite the possibility that it is a hoax, the page has generated at least 170 comments - laudatory and derogatory, and nearly all in Farsi - that highlight the deep political divisions in Iran and possibly opposition fervor from expatriate Iranians. One post compared Khamenei to a celebrated ruler of ancient Persia, Cyrus the Great, who significantly expanded the Persian empire 2,500 years ago. Another wrote: 'Mr. Khamenei, how are you visiting this page? With proxy?' It was a reference to Iran's blocking of Facebook and many other Western social media sites, and the efforts to bypass the restrictions using proxy server links from outside Iran. The U.S. State Department said Monday it will keep tabs on the page, but had no comment on whether it was genuine or not. Spokeswoman Victoria Nuland joked that Washington is curious how many 'likes' the Khamenei page receives. But much about the page - including an informal photo of Khamenei riding in a car - suggested it was not sanctioned by Iran's top leader. It is also highly unlikely that Khamenei would endorse a banned outlet such as Facebook. The Net is not unknown territory for Iranian leaders, however. Khamenei, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and others have official websites. Also, some senior Iranian clerics issue religious opinions by email.","facebook.com/Khamenei.ir launched a few days ago and has huge following .

"Once again, this was a Liverpool performance that lacked conviction. Once again, this was a Liverpool performance that made you wonder just what their defensive training entails at their Melwood training ground. Once again, this was a Liverpool performance that posed more questions than answers for their manager Brendan Rodgers. At half-time, Liverpool had seemed well on their way to a third win in a row and although this particular showing remained lightyears away from the dynamic and eminently watchable performances of last season, it would have taken them only five points behind Manchester United and within touching distance of the top four. Rodgers’ side, however, do not resemble a team capable of challenging for Champions League football, despite the best efforts of Arsenal and Manchester United to invite them back into the race. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats . Leicester City's Jeffrey Schlupp celebrates after scoring the goal to make it 2-2 against Liverpool at Anfield . Schlupp strikes the ball past Simon Mignolet on the hour mark to equalise for Leicester . It is a measure of Liverpool’s difficulties this season that a victory here - following successes over Burnley, Swansea City - would have represented their longest winning sequence in the Barclays Premier League this season. In truth, they were lucky to escape from this game with a point. Leicester hit the post inside the opening exchanges when Simon Mignolet was caught cold and a Riyad Mahrez free-kick cannoned off the inside of the post. Liverpool failed to heed the warning. Further chances passed Leicester by before their hosts were granted the initiative by a referee decision that Gary Lineker described as the ‘worst ever’ on Twitter. Certainly, Wes Morgan did not help his cause by sliding in, arms outstretched and flailing like an octopus but it did strike his head and Leicester have justification to be aggrieved. For a while, there were signs that Liverpool were discovering the zest and rhythm of happier days, particularly in the speed and skill of Raheem Sterling and Coutinho. They remain the two Liverpool players most eminently capable of raising this Liverpool team when they feel the need. It was this combination that combined so beautifully to slice open the first goal, as Coutinho received the ball on the half-turn, pirouetting into space and zipping a reverse ball into the run of Sterling.

There was one wonderful effort from Jordan Henderson who arrowed a volley inches past the juncture of post and bar, almost replicating the Paul Scholes effort at Bradford City all those years. In the second half, however, all that momentum dissipated. The vulnerabilities of the 3-5-2 system were exposed by a direct Leicester outfit. Gaps appeared between the defence and midfield, defenders backed off as Gerrard and Lucas were caught too high up the pitch. At 2-2, Liverpool were the side that appeared edgy, short on confidence and unable to seize the initiative. There was a telling moment when Steven Gerrard had possession on the right flank and with those in front of him stood like statues, he gestured furiously for some movement. A familiar groan rang out from those fans around the Press box. They have seen this ordinary level of performance far too often this season.

"By . Damien Gayle . Tragic: Kamaljit Sidhu leapt from a motorway bridge after her former partner put her through an ordeal of stalking and harassment, a court heard . The mother of a woman who leapt from a motorway bridge has condemned her daughter's stalking ex-lover for 'putting her through hell'. Ryan Dey, 23, refused to accept that Kamaljit Sidhu wanted to end their 18-month relationship and made threats towards her and her friends. He was arrested soon after Miss Sidhu jumped from a bridge over the M6 last autumn, and today he was jailed for two years after admitting stalking the 29-year-old. Passing sentence, a judge told how Dey had threatened to tell Miss Sidhu's family she had an abortion and that he had once beaten her up. Miss Sidhu's grieving mother Sarbjit Sidhu said 'evil' Dey put her daughter through an ordeal of 'control and abuse' in the weeks before she fell to her death. 'Does Ryan Dey really realise the damage he has inflicted on my beloved Kam, me and my family?' she asked in a statement released after the hearing today. 'We will never forget our baby Kam, I was unable to see her for the last time when she was put to rest and that has been difficult to deal with. 'Ryan Dey is evil, he is a bully and a coward and had put my daughter through hell with his control and abuse and will never be forgiven for what he has caused. 'As a mother and a family we want the world to know this can never be allowed to happen again, I do not want anyone else to go through what we have. Our lives have stopped and we can't breathe.' She added: 'The police asked is there anything we can do, Mrs Sidhu, and my only answer to them was can you please give me my daughter back, we really miss her, her death has left a big hole in our lives.' Miss Sidhu, who was known to loved ones as Kammi, leapt to her death last October from a bridge over the M6 near to Great Barr in the West Midlands, where she lived with her family. In the weeks leading up to her death, Birmingham Crown Court heard, she had been hounded by Dey, a lorry driver from Oldbury, who had refused to accept that she had put an end to their relationship. He made threats towards her, contacted her friends and had searched various locations in Birmingham, where she worked, trying to find her. She went on to make comments on social media telling friends that she was afraid of Dey in the lead up to her death. 'He put my daughter through hell': Ryan Dey, left, was arrested soon after Miss Sidhu, right, jumped from a bridge over the M6 last autumn, and today he was jailed for two years after admitting stalking the 29-year-old . Judge Michael Chambers said: 'You had been in a relationship with Kam for the previous 18 months notwithstanding the other relationship you were in. 'You did not like her seeing or socialising with anybody else. You did not even like it when she was seeing friends in her own home. 'She sought to end the relationship but instead of accepting it you started persistently harassing her. 'It led her to becoming very frightened. You even hacked into her Facebook system and sent messages to her friends pretending to be her. 'She was living at home with her parents and you called their land line at all times of night and day. You repeatedly went to the address and waited outside.' The court heard that on the night before Miss Sidhu's death, she had been out at a bar with friends following a job interview in Birmingham. But her 'demeanour changed dramatically' when she spotted Dey in the same bar with two men, leading her to drop down on all fours and hide from him. 'She continued the evening with her friends and she ended up on motorway bridge having been drinking,' the judge said. 'A message was written by her on a moisturiser bottle and said: ""I loved you all. I just got weak. Sorry.""' Afraid: The court heard that on the night before Miss Sidhu's death, she had been out with friends in Birmingham. When Dey arrived at the bar with two men she dropped down on all fours to hide from him . Miss Sidhu jumped to her death at 4.30am on October 25, hours after the incident in the bar. 'I'm satisfied that you did or said something to her that made her very frightened,' said Judge Chambers. 'Coupled with the background plus whatever had caused her to be so frightened of her significant factor which caused her to fall off that bridge. 'I'm satisfied she did take her life and you were a factor in that. 'What you did or communicate will never be known but from police interviews we know you threatened you would disclose to her family she had had an abortion and at least on one occasion you had beaten her up. 'She was a much loved and liked young woman with her life before her. Those close to her should understand any sentence does not reflect or measure the loss of a loved one.' Dey was arrested a month after Miss Sidhu's death and charged with harrassment and stalking. Prosecutor Peter Grieves-Smith told the court that on the night she spotted him while out drinking in Birmingham she had already told her parents that he had been in touch with her and that if he called the house not to tell him where she was. Dey began calling the Sidhus repeatedly, leading them to disconnect their phone. 'They did not wish to speak to him,' the prosecutor said. 'But the effects of that meant when the victim tried to call her parents later that night she couldn't get through.' 'Much loved and liked': The court heard that Dey repeatedly hacked into Miss Sidhu's Facebook account, sending abusive messages to her friends . Friends who were out with Miss Sidhu that evening got the impression that she was on edge, said Mr Grieves-Smith. 'The effect of what he did by coming to the bar that night was that she was terrified. The victim continued to hide and eventually she returned looking distressed,' he said. 'That night she left the bar after she was satisfied he was gone and she was given a lift by a friend. It was not long after she was dropped off she fell from the motorway bridge. 'Something had occurred to make her manifestly scared. We might never know what that was.' The court heard Dey sent a string of threatening messages to Miss Sidhu on Facebook just hours before she died. Mr Grieves-Smith added: 'It was clear that one of the Facebook entries from the defendant at 1.30am that night said ""I'm going to f*** you up"". 'He repeatedly hacked into her Facebook account and could see who she was communicating with and what she was doing. 'A Facebook message on October 23 at 6.21am from the victim's account to a friend asked ""What do you think about orgies and threesomes"". 'The message had been sent from the defendant who had hacked into the account. 'The victim's friend told police the defendant had said ""You stupid bitch I will tell your family all of the f***ed up shit you have done."" 'He also took her mobile phone and the purpose of doing so was control. 'Bit by bit it as time proceeded it got worse and had led to the moment of the early hours of October 25 when she died.' Dey was sentenced to two years in prison at Birmingham Crown Court after avoiding a trial by admitting stalking and causing serious alarm or distress at a hearing last month. Following the sentencing today, detective chief inspector Kim Madill, from West Midlands Police Public Protection Unit, said: 'This has been a difficult, challenging and deeply upsetting case to investigate for all concerned. 'The investigation team has worked tirelessly to try and find some justice for Kamaljit and her family, following her tragic and untimely death. 'One can only imagine the fear and torment that Dey must have put her through to take such a course of action. 'Even though this conviction cannot bring Kamaljit back, hopefully the fact that Dey has admitted his crimes and is now facing a spell in prison will come as some comfort to her grieving family.'","Kamaljit Sidhu was 'put through hell' by ex-partner who stalked her .

"The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme, set up in 2012 by the now First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster, is set to run £490m over its budget.
The motion, proposed by former DUP councillor Ruth Patterson, was passed by 23 votes in favour to 12 against.
The UK government has already rejected an Alliance call for a public inquiry.
The Treasury has refused to cover the RHI overspend and it will have to be paid from the block grant that Northern Ireland receives from Westminster.
Mrs Patterson, who was expelled from the DUP in 2015, asked her fellow councillors to note the ""serious public concern amongst our constituents in relation to financial squander"" over the RHI scheme.
Now an independent councillor, she proposed that Belfast City Council writes to Secretary of State James Brokenshire to request a public inquiry.
""The secretary of state has a public responsibility to initiate an inquiry regarding this,"" Mrs Patterson said.
""I certainly think he will listen to Belfast City Council - we are elected by the people and we certainly need to have our say in this. We are the closest, on the ground, to the people of Northern Ireland, right across the province, and everyone is talking about the same issue.""
A government spokesman said it is up to the Northern Ireland Executive to decide on what form of investigation is carried out.
Mrs Patterson's motion also called on her former party leader Mrs Foster to ""step aside"" during the inquiry.
DUP councillor Lee Reynolds said the outcome of the vote was ""predictable"" and accused other parties of playing political ""games"".
""They're not interested in solving the problems with RHI, which we should be trying to move forward,"" Mr Reynolds told BBC News NI.
""They're not interested in getting towards an independent investigation, they're just trying to find ways of having a go at the DUP and trying to undermine the First Minister Arlene Foster.""
Eighteen councillors abstained from taking part in the vote.
Sinn Féin attempted to amend Mrs Patterson's motion, this time calling not for a full public inquiry, but for an independent investigation led by a judicial figure from outside Northern Ireland, but their amendment did not attract enough support.
""We think the public want the truth, but they also want the truth as quickly as possible,"" said Sinn Féin councillor Jim McVeigh.
""They don't want to wait a year, or two years, like some of these public inquiries can take, so we think the best way to do this is a robust, transparent investigation that will get to the truth quickly.""
The Ulster Unionist Party also proposed an amendment that called on Mrs Foster to resign, but it too failed.
Earlier on Tuesday, it was reported that the UK government has already rejected a request from Alliance Party leader Naomi Long to hold a public inquiry into the RHI scandal.
Mrs Long had written to both Mr Brokenshire and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke to ask for their intervention.
A government spokesman said: ""The operation of the RHI scheme is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive. So it is right for the executive and the assembly to decide the form of any investigation or inquiry.""
Mrs Foster has resisted calls for a public inquiry and for her to temporarily step aside while the matter is investigated.
The matter has caused a rift at the heart of the Stormont administration, with Sinn Féin threatening to call a fresh election if the first minister does not stand aside for an investigation.",Belfast City Council has passed a motion calling on the government to hold a full public inquiry into Stormont's 'cash-for-ash' scandal.

"(CNN) -- The search for an American -- whose wife says he was shot on a lake that straddles the U.S.-Mexican border -- has been suspended, a Mexican official said Friday. David Hartley was reportedly shot to death September 30 by gunmen investigators believe are linked to a Mexican drug gang. At present, there are no Mexican agencies actively searching Falcon Lake for Hartley. But the mother of Tiffany Hartley -- the woman who says her husband was shot --  says she's ""hopeful that they'll restart on Monday,"" after meeting with Mexican officials on Friday. Cynthia Young, Tiffany's mother, said said that she, her daughter and Tiffany's dad met with Mexican and American officials for about 8 hours on Friday. Young would not specify which officials attended the meeting but said the family was told that the Mexican government was ""restrategizing"" how it is handling the search for Hartley's body. Young said that the day mostly entailed Tiffany refiling a witness statement with Mexican officials, recounting what happened on the day she said he was killed. Young said the meeting occurred in McAllen, Texas, where Tiffany and her husband had recently relocated. Earlier in the day, Tamaulipas state attorney general spokesman Ruben Dario Rios explained the decision to halt the search. ""Our investigators have taken a temporary recess so that we can better assess the strategies we are using to find the body. We are currently considering other approaches to our search,"" he said. The search was suspended on Thursday. Responding to local reports that it may have been threats of imminent gun battles by the Los Zetas cartel that led to Mexican officials to suspend the search, Dario Rios said, ""Negative."" ""We have no official information of threats on our investigators."" Tiffany's mother said that ""we're very disappointed"" in the development. ""The longer this goes the less chance there is of finding David,"" she said. Tiffany Hartley  told authorities the couple was on a sightseeing trip on Falcon Lake, a reservoir on the Rio Grande. She believes the attackers may still have her husband's body. Dario Rios said earlier Friday taht Tiffany Hartley has not responded to the attorney general's formal request for more information about the incident. ""We still have not spoken to her,"" he said. Young had said her daughter is willing to meet with Mexican authorities on her terms and on U.S. soil, not in Mexico. Tamaulipas state governor Eugenio Hernandez Flores, in Washington for annual meetings on Mexican-U.S. partnerships, was scheduled to  meet with FBI officials during his visit Friday to pledge cooperation as authorities look into the matter. He told CNN that Mexican police had deployed dozens of searchers but have found neither a body nor a jet ski. Tiffany said she met with the lead Mexican investigator in the death of her husband days before the police officer was killed and his severed head delivered to authorities in a suitcase. U.S. and Mexican authorities vowed the search for Hartley's husband would continue despite the investigator's slaying on Tuesday. ""I met him. He sat right next to me,"" Hartley said, referring to Mexican state official Rolando Armando Flores Villegas. Her remarks aired on CNN's ""American Morning"" Thursday. ""We talked through a translator and he just seemed like a really good guy who really wanted to just do good for -- you know, his country,"" Hartley said. Hartley said she wonders if the death of the lead Mexican investigator will hamper the search for her husband. ""It definitely makes me worried that nobody is going to want to take over,"" she said. On Thursday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States is doing everything it can to find Hartley and told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that she is ""sickened"" by the case. ""I hope that we can [find him],"" said Clinton. ""I mean, the beheaded body of the brave Mexican investigator that just showed up shows what we're dealing with."" She said the United States is ""supporting local law enforcement, supporting the authorities on the border, doing everything that we know to do to try to assist in helping to find the body and helping to find the perpetrators."" A report issued by a Texas-based think tank suggested Thursday that Hartley's death may have stemmed from a case of mistaken identity in the ongoing war between two Mexican drug cartels. The Stratfor report, which cites anonymous sources, noted that Hartley worked for an oil and gas company with operations in Reynosa, Mexico. The couple had lived there for two years and had only moved to McAllen within the past few months, the report said. The truck they drove to Falcon Lake on September 30 still had a license plate from Mexico's Tamaulipas state. The couple drove their personal watercraft to the Old Guerrero area of the lake, which the report said is a ""known battleground in the ongoing war in the Los Zetas and Gulf cartels."" The sources told Stratfor both cartels have been known to conduct surveillance and countersurveillance operations on personal watercraft, so Zetas scouts identified them as possible Gulf spies, because of their license plate and their method and direction of travel on Falcon Lake. They were then apparently confronted by ""Zetas enforcers,"" Stratfor said. The sources told Stratfor the attack was unauthorized by senior Los Zetas members and ""a damage control campaign is currently under way ... to identify and eliminate those who engaged the Hartleys without proper authorization."" Protocol involves prompt disposition of a body to ensure no evidence can be brought against the group, the report said. Sources said that ""once Hartley was identified as an American, his body was destroyed the same day as the incident to prevent a backlash from the U.S. government against the group,"" Stratfor said. ""With the heavy diplomatic and public pressure on both U.S. and Mexican authorities to find David Hartley's remains in the investigation, the decapitation of Flores Villegas was a stern signal to both the United States and Mexico that no body will be produced and to leave the situation alone."" Falcon Lake is about 70 miles west of the Hartleys' home in McAllen. CNN's Ed Lavandera, Eric Fiegel and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Tiffany Hartley meets with Mexican authorities in Texas .

"Tasered teen: Bryce Masters isno longer in a medically induced coma and is speaking with family members . The Missouri police officer who used a stun gun on a 17-year-old during a traffic stop says he smelled marijuana in the vehicle and saw him recording the incident on an iPhone. Bryce Masters has been upgraded from critical to serious condition at a hospital where he was taken Sunday after the Independence police officer used a Taser on him. A spokesman for Masters' family says he went into cardiac arrest and was being treated for a lack of oxygen to his brain. According to a search warrant application, the officer smelled marijuana inside the car. Police said they later found drug paraphernalia. Police say Masters was pulled over because of a warrant attached to the license plate of the vehicle and was combative when ordered to get out. The Kansas City Star reports  Masters  began slowly recovering overnight Wednesday. Family attorney Daniel Haus characterized the recovery as a miracle. Masters' family has said his heart stopped after he was shocked with the stun gun during a traffic stop on Sunday in Independence. Bryce suffered some memory loss and doctors do not yet know what the long term affects will be. Police say he was combative and wouldn't comply with the officer's demands. They say he was pulled over because of a warrant associated with the license plate on the car, which belonged to someone else. 'They are seeing some signals that their son may make a fairly remarkable recovery, basically coming back from the dead,' Haus told the Kansas City Star.'It looks like whatever the doctors did with this medically induced coma, this new procedure where they lower the body temperature, was exactly what he needed,' Haus added. The FBI is investigating after a police officer used a stun gun to subdue Bryce Masters in suburban Kansas City, Missouri, on Sunday afternoon after stopping a car he was driving because it had a warrant attached to it. The officer, identified by the police department as Tim Runnels, has been placed on administrative leave. An eyewitness filmed the incident on her cell phone. In the footage you can see the officer dragging the Bryce's body to the sidewalk, then standing with his foot on the teen's back (ringed) Police said in the statement that Bryce became uncooperative and physically resisted getting out of the car, prompting Runnels to warn Bryce he would use a stun gun. Police said the stun gun was used on Bryce while he was still in the car but he was able to get out of the car on his own. The confrontation continued outside the car and both Bryce and Runnels fell to the ground. The teen then suffered a 'medical emergency' and needed resuscitation, prompting a call for an ambulance, police said. But eyewitnesses gave a different account to Fox4KC. Michelle Baker filmed the incident on her mobile phone when she heard screams outside and says she saw the Runnels Taser the teen when he was inside his car. In a cell phone video taken by Baker you can see the officer dragging the teen's body to the sidewalk, then standing with his foot on the teen's back. You could tell the kid was going into convulsions. 'He turned him over and his head was dangling like this and he had blood coming out,' said Baker. Curtis Martes, 17, says the teen was coming over to play XBox with him. 'I hear him say from my porch he's like 'I can't roll down my window it's broke,' said Martes. 'He was like 'what am I being arrested for?' The cop just grabbed him and said 'you're under arrest,' said Martes. The officer, identified by the police department as Tim Runnels, has been placed on administrative leave. The footage, shot on Sunday, shows him walking up to the Bryce's body (left) and stepping over it right) He is then (pictured) seen raising his foot as Master lies on the ground. 'He like threw him on the ground busted his face up.

'Several times, the cop put his foot on the kid like he was stepping on his neck, but it was on his back,' said Robert Baker, who lives nearby told The Kansas City Star. 'I think (the officer) was wrong, because the kid tried to explain to him that his window won't roll down.'

Doctors have reacted with anger after leaked documents revealed plans by union militants to intimidate GPs over health reforms. Unite's 'leverage team' – the dirty tricks unit which bullied managers and their families during last year’s Grangemouth oil refinery dispute in Scotland – intends to deploy the same tactics against doctors involved in 'privatising' the NHS. At a recent Unite executive meeting attended by controversial general secretary ‘red’ Len McCluskey, there was a proposal that ‘the next comprehensive leverage campaign will be focused on [the] defence of the National Health Service’. According to leaked minutes, the leverage team suggested taking action at a ‘local level’ by using ‘direct intervention to... target private health care companies and commissioning bodies’. Under the Government’s health reforms, the bodies, partly staffed by GPs, are responsible for putting local medical contracts out to tender – and are therefore seen by Left-wing opponents as being in the vanguard of privatisation. During the Grangemouth dispute last autumn, the sinister leverage unit – staffed by campaigners who describe themselves as ‘industrial terrorists’ – personally targeted executives of the Ineos chemical company which owns the plant by sending mobs of protesters to their homes. One director embroiled in the row over pay and conditions said he had feared for the safety of his wife and two young children after 30 Unite activists descended on his drive during the school holidays and told his neighbours that he was 'evil'. And the daughter of another company boss had 'Wanted' posters denouncing her father posted through her front door in Hampshire. During the Grangemouth dispute (pictured) the sinister leverage unit personally targeted executives of the Ineos chemical company which owns the plant by sending mobs of protesters to their homes . Last night, Tory Health Minister Dan Poulter condemned Unite’s plan, saying: 'We take threats to doctors and nurses very seriously.' 'Unite may have walked all over Ed Miliband and taken over the Labour Party, but we will not let them do that to our NHS.' Leading GP Michael Dixon, the president of NHS Clinical Commissioners, said: 'This plan is deeply worrying. It will be the patients who suffer from attempts to intimidate hard-working doctors.' 'Nobody deserves to be threatened just for trying to improve patient care.' Last night, a Unite spokeswoman said that while the executive had discussed the plan, it was 'just a proposal. She added that defending the NHS from the 'savagery' of the Government was 'one of the most serious issues facing the country'.","Unite 'leverage team' intends to deploy same tactics used at Grangemouth .

"Hess's bones were exhumed at the graveyard in the town of Wunsiedel, southern Germany, early on Wednesday.
The remains were later cremated and are to be scattered at sea.
Hess was captured after flying to Britain in 1941 and sentenced to life in prison. He killed himself in a Berlin jail in 1987 at the age of 93.
As he requested in his will, he was buried in the small Bavarian town of Wunsiedel, where his family had a holiday home and where his parents were already interred.
The local Lutheran church which supervises the cemetery gave its permission for the burial at the time, ruling that the wishes of the deceased could not be ignored.
But they and local people have since become concerned by the number of far-right groups visiting the grave.
Each year on the anniversary of his death, neo-Nazis have attempted to stage a march to the cemetery, saluting the grave with its epitaph ""I dared"", and laying floral wreaths.
The enduring myth of Rudolf Hess
A member of the church council, Hans-Juergen Buchta, told the Associated Press news agency: ""The whole town was shut down and in turmoil and there was a huge police presence. We here at the graveyard were not always able to cope.""
A 2005 court order banning such gatherings had little effect so the church decided to terminate the family's lease on the grave as of October 2011.
A granddaughter of Hess objected to the decision and filed a lawsuit in an attempt to prevent it going ahead, but was eventually persuaded by the parish council to drop the case and allow the exhumation to go ahead.
Roland Schoeffel, the deputy mayor of Wunsiedel, told AFP news agency that the monument had been razed ""in an operation not open to the public"".
Cemetery administrator Andreas Fabel told AP news agency on Thursday: ""The grave is now empty. The bones are gone.""
One resident, named as Mrs Koenig, said: ""Perhaps we will now have some peace when he is gone. Perhaps they won't come any more, which is what Wunsiedel wants.""
Charlotte Knobloch, the head of the Jewish community in Munich and Upper Bavaria, welcomed the move.
""For decades this town and its inhabitants were terrorised by far-right extremists from all over the world,"" she is quoted as saying by AFP.
Hess was one of Hitler's closest aides. But in 1941 he made a solo flight to Scotland, where his plane crash-landed, in an apparently unauthorised peace mission which was denounced by the fuhrer.
He was imprisoned by the British for the duration of the war.
At the Nuremberg Trials in 1946, Hess was cleared of war crimes and crimes against humanity but convicted of crimes against peace and jailed for life.
He spent 40 years in Spandau Prison in Berlin.
He was the last remaining inmate at the prison when he was found hanged there in August 1987.",The grave holding the remains of Adolf Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess has been destroyed to stop it being used as a pilgrimage site by neo-Nazis.

 Twin sisters who gained fame after becoming the first people in Colorado to receive a pioneering surgery for obsessive compulsive disorder were found dead with gunshot wounds in Cañon City, the Fremont County Sheriff's Office confirmed Monday. 
  
 Sisters Amanda and Sara Eldritch were found Friday in a vehicle parked near a rest area at the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park. They were 33 years old. 
  
 The sisters, who lived in Broomfield, were the first people in Colorado to receive deep brain stimulation — a surgery commonly used for patients with Parkinson's disease — to treat their often-debilitating symptoms of OCD. 
  
 In a spring 2016 publication printed by Littleton Adventist Hospital, where they received the surgery, the twins said they began to feel at peace with their existence after receiving the treatment in spring 2015. One year after the treatment, Sara Eldritch told the hospital, ""I feel like I can identify my anxiety. I can actually see where it's coming from. And I feel like I can deal with it."" 
  
 But before the surgery, the story said, ""they felt at war with their own existence. And in a desperate cry for help as adolescents, they tried taking their own lives.""

 For the sisters, coping with the disorder meant living with compulsions, such as taking 10-hour showers, 20-minute hand-washings and using dozens of bottles of rubbing alcohol to disinfect everything they touched. 
  
 For many patients with OCD, according to the hospital, unwanted thoughts become unavoidable, causing them to act on compulsions. 
  
 The deep brain stimulation was intended to inhibit overactive parts of the brain, halting anxiety and making therapy more effective. As part of the procedure, a surgeon, Dr. David VanSickle, placed electrodes on specific areas of their brains, with electrode wires under the skin of their heads, neck and shoulder. 
  
 The wires were then connected to a battery pack inserted into their chests. In programming appointments, doctors ensured that their brains received enough stimulation. 
  
 One year after the surgery, the spring 2016 publication said, the twins began finding ""hope and joy in simple things like taking a morning walk — something they hadn't done in more than a decade."" 
  
 And one year after the publication was printed, the twins were featured on an episode of the TV show, ""The Doctors,"" where they were taken for spa treatments separately from each other to ""help them break through their codependency,"" the show's website said. 
  
 The sisters also spent the night in two separate hotels as part of the show, where they found struggles but made it through the night, it said. 
  
 ""I did kind of like the contrast of, this is what it's like to be alone, and this is what it's like to be back with my sister and friends,"" Amanda Eldritch said at the time. ""I like having two things to compare."" 
  
 The sheriff's office said in a news release that no other information is available at this time. 
  
 Sara Knuth: 719-276-7644, knuths@canoncitydailyrecord.com ||||| Twin sisters - the first in Colorado to receive a pioneering surgery to treat their obsessive compulsive disorder - were found fatally shot Friday in a vehicle near Royal Gorge Bridge and Park, the Fremont County Sheriff's Office said. 
  
 Sara and Amanda Eldritch, 33, of Broomfield, appear to have died in a suicide pact, said sheriff's spokeswoman Sgt. Megan Richards. 
  
 They had received deep brain stimulation at Littleton Adventist Hospital in the spring of 2015, the Cañon City Daily Record reported. 
  
 In the procedure, typically used for patients with Parkinson's disease or essential tremor, electrodes are placed on areas of the brain, says an article in the hospital's spring 2016 magazine. 
  
 ""The electrode wires are placed under the skin of the head, neck, and shoulder, connecting with a battery pack (called a neurostimulator), which is implanted in the chest during a second procedure about a week later,"" the article says. ""Then, routine programming appointments help ensure the brain gets the proper amount of stimulation."" 
  
 Before the surgery, the article says, the sisters ""felt at war with their own existence. And in a desperate cry for help as adolescents, they tried taking their own lives."" 
  
 A year after the surgery, they were ""finding hope and joy in simple things like taking a morning walk - something they hadn't done in more than a decade,"" the article says. 
  
 The sisters were featured on an episode of ""The Doctors,"" a CBS talk show. 
  
 Friday, their bodies were found in a vehicle parked at a rest area near the Royal Gorge, the Sheriff's Office reported. A sheriff's news release Saturday said one body had been found. 
  
 ""After further investigation and results from the autopsy,"" a Monday release said, ""this appears to be an isolated incident, and there is no threat to the public.""

"A team of diggers has started removing 2,500 tonnes of waste from a 40ft-high rat-infested rubbish pile which has blighted the lives of residents for the past three years. The towering mountain of putrid rubbish sits at the end of cul-de-sac near Orpington, Kent, and is laden with everything . imaginable - from rotting industrial waste, old shoes and broken fridges . to tyres, scrap metal, excrement, discarded nappies and plastic bottles. The stinking mound - which residents say 'smells like rotting corpses' - is also prone to catching fire, as 'hot spots' smoulder deep inside the 60-ft wide pile of rubbish. Fire crews have now been called to 23 fires at the site - one of which lasted ten days - which has cost the taxpayer £650,000. Scroll down for video . This 40ft pile of stinking rubbish has blighted the lives of . residents living in a cul-de-sac near Orpington, Kent, since . 2011. Now, experts from the Environment Agency are starting to remove . some of the waste . The Environment Agency, which has been locked in a High Court legal battle with Waste4Fuel, which runs the site, has called in experts to remove 2,500 tonnes of rubbish from the 20,000 tonne pile . The towering mountain, which sits at the end of cul-de-sac, is laden with everything imaginable - from rotting industrial waste, old shoes and broken fridges to tyres, scrap metal, excrement, discarded nappies and plastic bottles . Now the Environment Agency - which is locked in a High Court legal battle with Waste4Fuel, which runs the site - has ordered experts to remove some of the mess so the pile is at a 'safe' level and stops spontaneously catching fire. But fed-up locals in Cornwall Drive, St Paul's Cray, say the action is not enough - and have called for the entire 20,000-tonne mountain to be removed. Jan Watkins, 60, a grandmother-of-two, said: 'It is a plague. It is a living nightmare. It is really, really horrible. You can't open your doors or your windows. The smell that comes through is like rotting corpses. 'You can't go out, it is in your clothes, in your hair, because the smell gets in them. You can't use your garden. Many residents have sore throats and coughs. Anybody who has a breathing problem suffers greatly.' Ms Watkins said residents had been campaigning to clear the site for three years and accused the EA of allowing the mound to spiral out of control by failing to take swift action. She said she feared the frequent fires . were belching toxic fumes which could be endangering the health of her . two young grandchildren, whom she looks after during the day. She said: 'If the Environment Agency . had taken action when we wanted them to two and a half years ago it . would be half the size. We feel very, very let down.' The mountain of garbage has been a problem for residents since rubbish disposal . company Waste4Fuel took over the site in 2011. Fire crews have been called to 23 fires at . the site, mostly during the hot summer weather, costing the taxpayer £650,000 and taking up 2,000 hours of firefighters' time . But residents say efforts by the EA to remove some of the waste - which includes rotting industrial waste, tyres, scrap metal and even excrement - is too little too late. They are campaigning for the entire tip to be removed . According . to its website, the firm’s aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . and it ‘specialises in the collection and correct disposal of waste that . can be reprocessed for use in generating electricity.’ It charges people to dump rubbish at the site during the day and the night, which it then sorts, treats and sends on for disposal elsewhere. But residents say this practice does not happen and instead, over the past couple of . years, Waste4Fuel has simply taken the money and let it stack up into a . monstrous pile. Resident Denise Clark, 34, a mother-of-two, said : 'The smell, especially when it's hot, is repugnant, disgusting. It makes you feel sick to the stomach. It's like living next to a sewage . works. 'We have a real rat . problem. The size of the rats are massive - up to 2ft with their tails. I . have a three-year-old son and five-year-old daughter and it makes me . fear for their health. My son has eczema and it is not good for him.' Diggers working on the site is the first sign of any tangible action . being taken to free the residents of the rat-infested rubbish mound, which regularly catches fire . Waste4Fuel uses the site as a waste transfer site where it 'processes . general non-hazardous waste'. It is allowed a maximum of 5,500 tonnes on the site at . a time - but has almost four times that amount . She said local schools do not allow children out in the playground at break when the rubbish pile is on fire because of health fears. She added that residents fear the pile will one day cause a fire that gets out of control and spreads. She said: 'About 18 months ago there was a fire that lasted 10 days and that was pretty scary. If the wind was blowing the other way it could have taken the whole street out.' Ms Clark also blamed the unsightly 'scourge' for sending house prices in the street down, saying house prices had plummeted by £100,000. The location of a waste or recycling plant is the responsibility of the local authority, which in this case is Bromley Council. But . its size and scope is set out in the operating permit granted by the . Environment Agency, which allows Waste4Fuel to use the site ‘as a waste . transfer station processing general non-hazardous waste, from commercial . operators with [a maximum] of 5,500 tonnes allowed at any time.’ The pile is often seen emitting steam, as . rubbish smoulders deep inside the mound, pictured left. It is that which . has forced the EA to send in workers, pictured right, in a bid to take . the mound to a 'safe' level . The height and width of the giant mound mean most residents can see the rubbish pile from their window. Resident Denise Clark, 34, said the smell is 'repugnant, disgusting' and it is 'like living next to a sewage works' The . Environment Agency is currently locked in a legal battle with the firm, claiming it has not been paying for . the mound to be treated and sent on for disposal or recycling elsewhere. Last November, the agency won a court order for Waste4Fuel to clear the site of combustible waste by the end of April. But the firm said it could only afford to comply by generating more money — by allowing more waste to be brought on site — and applied to increase the amount of rubbish it handles from 75 to 200 tonnes a week. It ended up failing to comply with the order. The Environment Agency then tried to seek contempt charges against the recycling company, former company director Bryan Hughes, new company director Shelley Hurst and site manager Jonathan Beckson. The charges were in relation to . Waste4Fuel not complying with an undertaking to install appropriate fire . breaks and separate areas for new waste at the site. Resident Jan Watkins, 60, said she cannot open her doors or windows because the smell comes through like 'rotting corpses'. She said the smell even gets in her hair and on her clothes when she steps outside . Steam can often be seen coming from the top of the rubbish mountain as fire from within smoulders away, creating a putrid stench of burning plastic for local residents . But, in July this year, the High Court dismissed the case – a decision which the agency is now deciding whether to appeal. Talking about the team of diggers, the EA said: 'Environment Agency contractors have entered the Waste4Fuel site in Orpington in an operation to lower the illegal waste pile to a safe level. 'The Environment Agency's battle to ensure that the site operator and landowner clean up the site is continuing, but is taking this rare step to reduce the blight on the local community.' Rob Wise, environment manager at the EA, said: 'We understand the frustration of local residents and we will continue our fight against Waste4Fuel. 'It is not right that taxpayers should pick up the bill for this operation when it remains the responsibility of the site operator and landowners, but the priority is to make the site as safe as possible. 'We are committed to working with our partners, including the London Borough of Bromley, to find a long-term solution.'","The 40ft tip, which is also 60ft wide, has 20,000 tonnes of rubbish which towers above street near Orpington, Kent .

"(CNN) -- When Joanne Branham lost her husband, Frank, to a brain tumor, she was devastated. But it wasn't until she visited her old neighbors in McCullom Lake, Illinois, that she began to question the cause of his death. Back in the community where she and Frank had lived for almost 40 years, Branham learned two of her former neighbors also had brain tumors. ""It was like a light bulb went off,"" Branham recalls. ""How can that many have cancer living right next door to each other?"" Since then, more brain cancer cases have turned up, 30 in all, among current and former residents of McCullom Lake, a community of about 1,000 residents in northern Illinois, not far from the Wisconsin state line. Branham and others in McCullom Lake are now pointing the finger at a chemical plant a mile up the road in Ringwood, Illinois. For decades, they say, the Rohm and Haas plant dumped, spilled and leaked thousands of pounds of vinyl chloride and other toxic chemicals, poisoning the water and air around McCullom Lake. ""I don't think there's been a bigger brain cancer cluster outside the workplace -- ever,"" says Aaron Freiwald, attorney for 31 McCullom Lake Village plaintiffs now suing Rohm and Haas. In addition to the brain cancer cases, there is one plaintiff alleging her liver damage resulted from environmental pollution. The company denies making anyone sick. Branham's case is the first to go to trial, with jury selection set to begin Wednesday in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 'Frank didn't have a chance' Frank Branham died in June 2004, a month after learning that he had a deadly glioblastoma brain tumor. He was 63. ""Frank didn't have a chance,"" Joanne Branham says. ""What they did was very wrong. They played with people's lives. I lost a husband, who was my best friend. The kids lost their father. The grandkids lost their grandfather,"" she added, barely able to get her words out through her tears. Rohm and Haas says even though the cancer cases are close together, they are random. ""There is no cluster in McCullom Lake Village,"" says Kevin Van Wart, attorney for Rohm and Haas. ""If you draw circles around selected cases, you can always draw the conclusion of something unusual."" Brain and central nervous system cancers strike 7.6 per 100,000 people in the United States, according to the National Cancer Institute. An estimated 22,020 men and women in the United States will get diagnosed with these cancers this year. A month after the lawsuit was filed in 2006, the McHenry County Health Department in Illinois concluded there was no cluster of cancer cases in McCullom Lake. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did its own analysis and agreed. Originally a dairy . The Rohm and Haas site produces polymers, adhesives, resins and sealants on a 120-acre site originally built as a dairy operation in 1916 and converted to chemical manufacturing in the early 1940s. The facility has disposed its waste off site since 1978, but vinyl chloride, trichloroethylene, or TCE, and vinylidene chloride have all been found in nearby groundwater, according to the CDC. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services calls vinyl chloride ""a known carcinogen."" Long-term exposure to vinyl chloride on the job increases workers' risk of cancers of the liver, brain, lung and blood, according to the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Breathing or drinking high levels of TCE can damage the central nervous system, liver and lungs and also cause an abnormal heartbeat, according to the agency. Breathing high levels of vinylidene chloride can affect the central nervous system, liver and kidneys, the agency says. But Van Wart, the Rohm and Haas attorney, says the plume of contaminated groundwater is moving away from McCullom Lake and does not affect any homes or residential wells. ""Nobody disputes that it exists. But that is not going anywhere near McCullom Lake Village,"" Van Wart says. ""No agency has ever concluded any resident was exposed to dangerous chemicals."" To put residents' fears at ease, Rohm and Haas has offered to pay up to $50,000 to test residents' wells. There are about 400 homes with private wells in the village. The company has also offered to pay $5,000 to monitor the air for vinyl chloride and $50,000 for an independent analysis of theories of possible vinyl chloride exposure. 'A beautiful place to live' When Joanne and Frank Branham moved to McCullom Lake in August 1960, they saw a picturesque community with other young families. ""It was a beautiful place to live. We lived by a beach. We had such close neighbors. The whole subdivision was like a family,"" says Branham, who raised five children there. Frank Branham worked as general manager at a die cast plant in nearby Woodstock, Illinois. On Sundays, the husbands would go down to the beach to play baseball. The wives would pack picnic baskets and watch. Looking back, Joanne Branham says there were warning signs. In the summer, a terrible odor would sometimes force them to close their windows, she says. ""We didn't put two and two together until we found there were so many other neighbors with cancers,"" Branham says. After her husband died, Joanne Branham's children bought her a plane ticket to return to Illinois, from Phoenix, Arizona, where she and her husband had retired. Visiting old friends, she learned former next-door neighbor Bryan Freund also has a brain tumor, an oligodendroglioma. So does Kurt Weisenberger, who lives on the other side of the Freunds, two doors down from the Branhams' former home. Freund, 49, a truck driver and jewelry store owner, says he never gave the Rohm and Haas plant a second thought until Joanne Branham came back to town. ""It was really just a place I drove past,"" says Freund, who now suffers from headaches, seizures and memory loss. ""I had dreams and aspirations,"" he adds. ""Now when I look to the future it's really sort of a blank. I can't really expect to have one. That's a daily struggle."" Weisenberger, 69, a retired general contractor, says he hopes the lawsuit will bring out the truth of what happened to the people of McCullom Lake. ""It was a cover-up from the get-go as far as I'm concerned,"" says Weisenberger, who also suffers from seizures. Joanne Branham says she hopes the lawsuit, which asks for unspecified compensatory and punitive compensation, will make companies think twice. ""What they did was wrong, and if this will save one person's life and they won't do this again, it will be worth it,"" she says. The trial is expected to last 10 to 12 weeks.","McCullom Lake, a small community in Illinois, has seen 30 brain cancer cases .

He may have trust issues with women - but that certainly doesn't stop Josh Elliott from bedding them, according to new reports. It was revealed today that The Good Morning America anchor has been seen doing the 'walk of shame' from the home of WABC-TV anchor Liz Cho. The reports come just one day after the 41-year-old was described as being 'high-maintenance' and having 'serious trust issues with women stemming from a difficult childhood' - but friends of the star say he considers these rumours to be 'hurtful'. The couple were first reported to be in a relationship in September and a source told RadarOnline today: 'Josh has been seen sneaking out of Liz's apartment way early in the morning. 'It's been going on for at least three or four months, and she is in the middle of a really messy divorce.'

' Ms Cho, 41, split from her husband Evan Gottlieb over the summer and moved out of their Yonker's mansion with her daughter to a Upper West Side apartment - where Josh has been seen leaving in the early hours of the morning.

The TV hosts were first spotted having dinner together in Manhattan in September sparking rumors of a fledgling relationship, but at the time friends said it was not a serious romance and they had been on a few dates. The New York Post reported that Ms Cho and her ex-husband were embroiled in a nasty legal battle over renovation work done to their $2.2 million, nine-bedroom, four-bathroom Westchester mansion. Ms Cho split from her husband Evan Gottlieb, pictured, over the summer and moved out of their Yonker's mansion with her daughter to a Upper West Side apartment . Cathal Maguire, a Yonkers contractor, claimed that Ms Cho and Mr Gottlieb racked up a $430,875 bill for upgrades made to their home and then stiffed him for $100,875 of the work. Ms Cho and her spouse filed a counterclaim in state Supreme Court in White Plains alleging Maguire inflated prices, charged for work never done and did a shoddy job. The case is ongoing. Meanwhile, It was also claimed that Josh has repeatedly clashed with co-host Lara Spencer . over trivial issues, including how stories are covered, and the pair's off-air relationship is anything but amicable. The only woman he is said to have any time for is primary anchor Robin Roberts. 'The only female Josh hasn't fought with is Robin Roberts, because he respects her for her previous work at ESPN, the source told Radar.

"The ""Read On. Get On."" report said children who fell behind could feel the impact for the rest of their lives.
It said they were less likely to gain good qualifications and go on to further education.
The coalition behind the report aims to have all 11-year-olds reading well within a generation.
Organisations such as Save the Children and the Scottish Book Trust are part of the coalition. They want to see parents reading to young children for 10 minutes a day.
Their report said that 40% of families in the lowest income bracket had fewer than 10 children's books at home and fathers from these households were half as likely to read with their children at age two as fathers in the highest income households.
It said that this impacted on children later in life as those who were read to often as toddlers were more likely to become keen readers themselves.
The Read on coalition said there were 220,000 children living in poverty in Scotland and they expected this number to rise.
Neil Mathers, head of Scotland at Save the Children, said: ""As a country we cannot continue with a situation where one in five poor children are not reading well at the end of primary school. It is unfair.
""We know that getting every child reading well at 11 cannot happen overnight but it is possible within a generation if we work together.
""Read On. Get On. is a mission to galvanise the nation so that parents, grandparents and volunteers play their part in teaching children to read. We want every child to be given a fair and equal chance to learn to read well, regardless of their background.""
While children are still reading books, the report found that the most commonly read material by children is now text messages, with websites and e-books growing in popularity.","One in five children from poor families in Scotland leaves primary school unable to read well, according a group aiming to tackle poor literacy levels."

 The scene was chaotic at McCorkle Place on the campus of UNC-Chapel Hill on the evening of August 20. Students and antiracist activists were angry after brief skirmishes with the university police, but they were mostly determined that the Confederate monument Silent Sam would come down. 
  
 They were also on edge as neo-Confederates and other far-right activists milled around the periphery in the semi-darkness, watching with grim resignation. Some walked up to students holding banners and verbally sparred; one has been accused of charging a student protester, while another has been accused of threatening someone with a knife. Among the crowd at the base of Silent Sam before the statue was pulled down that night was Dwayne Dixon, a forty-six-year-old UNC teaching assistant professor, and a group of friends. 
  
 Dixon might be the most renowned antifascist activist in the state because of his role with the left-wing militia Redneck Revolt in providing armed security for a park held by antiracist activists during the August 12, 2017, Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, and then a week later when he carried a rifle in response to a threatened Ku Klux Klan rally in Durham. He had been charged with going armed to the terror of the people and bringing a weapon to a downtown demonstration for his involvement in the Durham incident, but a judge dismissed the charges, finding that they were unconstitutional. 
  
 Some of the far-right activists stationed at the periphery of the crowd recognized Dixon at the Silent Sam protest on August 20. 
  
 “There’s Dwayne Dixon, that communist leader!” one man exclaimed angrily. More than one person stalked Dixon with a camera phone, accusing him of “chasing” James Fields Jr. with a rifle and causing him to kill Heather Heyer when he rammed his car into a crowd of people in Charlottesville. One of the accusers, who declined to give his name, was captured on video accosting Dixon. Another was Patrick Howley, the twenty-eight-year-old editor of the alt-right website Big League Politics. 
  
 The hideous falsehood—that Dixon caused Fields to kill Heyer—is among the most durable hoaxes to grow out of Unite the Right. Popularized by the far-right outlets InfoWars and Gateway Pundit, along with Howley’s outfit Big League Politics, the hoax has been widely embraced as a deflection of responsibility by Unite the Right participants. 
  
 On the evening of August 20, Howley approached Dixon near the base of Silent Sam. 
  
 “Dwayne, why did you chase James Fields with a rifle right before he hit those people?” Howley asked. The sixty-eight-second video posted on YouTube by Big League Politics reporter Peter D’Abrosca shows the two men arguing; at one point the lens is obscured and the shot jumps as if the person holding the phone was jostled. The next day, Howley published an article on the Big League Politics site with the title “VIDEO: UNC Antifa Professor Assaults Big League Editor At Statue Tear-Down.” 
  
 × 
  
 Accompanied by his friend, a Chapel Hill-based political consultant named Noel Fritsch, Howley later went to a local magistrate’s office and swore out a warrant resulting in a misdemeanor charge against Dixon for simple assault. In a victim statement, Howley wrote that Dixon “rushed me, grabbed my left hand and armed with my phone in it, and struck me repeatedly.” 
  
 Dixon stood trial in Orange County District Court on November 15. His lawyer, Scott Holmes, mounted an elaborate defense, attempting to impeach Howley’s credibility as a witness by building a case that Howley’s coverage is driven by ideology and monetizes a pattern of falsehoods based on dubious sourcing. Holmes also argued that the video contradicted Howley’s testimony about the alleged assault, resulting in a “fatal variance.” But Judge Samantha Cabe didn’t have to rule on any of those questions. Holmes was holding an ace card—an apparent typo by the magistrate that the District Attorney’s Office failed to correct before taking the case to trial. 
  
 “Finally, the reason that it’s really defective is that it names Dwayne Dixon as the victim and not only the perpetrator,” Holmes said. “They have not proven that Mr. Dixon assaulted himself.” 
  
 Judge Cabe quickly announced that she was dismissing the charge because of a “fatal flaw” in the charging document. 
  
 × Expand Jordan Green UNC professor Dwayne Dixon addresses the media on the steps of the Orange County courthouse before standing trial. 
  
 Flanked by supporters before the start of the trial, Dixon gave a brief statement on the steps of the courthouse in Hillsborough. He accused Howley and his colleagues of continuing “to create falsehoods in order to create a narrative to maintain power—a power that they can only finally ever acquire by actually killing people, by killing Heather Heyer, by killing the eleven people who died in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. This is the truth that needs to be told: that these individuals are working in collusion with the very killers who are now incarcerated for murder.” 
  
 Although he benefited from skillful representation, Dixon made it clear that whatever the outcome of the trial, he viewed the legal process as illegitimate from the start. 
  
 “I have no truck with this legal system,” he said. “I have no faith in it. And yet, if we as a larger society are going to be in agreement about something, it’s that putting people in the ground is not the way to create a healthy, beneficial, and open life for all of us. So when I go in today, the things that are going to happen today are largely immaterial. I’m not concerned. This was completely based on untruths.” 
  
 Holmes cross-examined Howley for more than an hour—roughly seven times the length of the time used by the prosecutor for direct examination and showing the video of the incident. Throughout the trial, Howley displayed evasion and even defiance. On eight different occasions, Judge Cabe admonished him to answer Holmes’s questions, and three times she told him to not speak unless he was responding to a question. The judge also expressed impatience with Holmes, sharply ordering him to “move on” at one point. 
  
 Holmes reminded Howley that August 20 was not the first time he had approached Dixon with a camera phone and attempted to ask him about James Fields. Howley admitted that when he and Noel Fritsch accosted Dixon in the hallway of a UNC academic building in February, he did not have an appointment to meet Dixon and did not give him notice that he was coming. And although Howley publicly accused Dixon of assaulting Noel Fritsch—identified on the site as a “Big League cameraman”—Howley testified that Fritsch opted to not pursue charges. 
  
 Howley presented himself as a neutral interlocutor who remains open-minded while attempting to pose questions. He said that, in addition to asking Dixon about James Fields, he wanted to ask Dixon if he stood “behind the violence that Redneck Revolt has perpetrated across this country”—another leading question based on a faulty premise. 
  
 Howley, like other activists and media figures on the far right, latched on to a Facebook comment by Dixon—since deleted—in retort to an anti-Antifa viral social media post by the firearms maker Spike’s Tactical, in which Dixon said he was proud to have carried a Spike’s firearm when he “chased off James Fields” from the block he was patrolling when Fields drove past, shortly before Fields rammed into a crowd of antiracist marchers three blocks south. Later, Dixon clarified in a talk at Harvard University that Fields “paused right in front of me, and I waved him off with my rifle.” 
  
 During the trial, Holmes asked Howley if he had seen the video presented by prosecutors in the Fields case that showed the defendant putting his car in reverse for more than a block, and then accelerating into the crowd. Howley’s responses were evasive, and after Holmes asked a third time, he finally said, “I saw the video. That’s your interpretation of what happened.” 
  
 Judge Cabe said she didn’t understand “the purpose of rehashing what happened in Charlottesville.” 
  
 “It shows how his level of competency as a witness—to somehow accuse Mr. Dixon of—to have seen the video of what happened and want to go to UNC campus and stick a camera in his face and accuse him of any responsibility shows that this person lacks all credibility whatsoever,” Holmes replied. 
  
 Holmes called Howley’s attention to an article in which he described Dixon as “the de facto leader” of the August 20 rally that ended with the toppling of Silent Sam. After initially refusing to answer the question of how many sources he had for the statement, Howley finally responded, “Based on my research, I count myself as a source on that. I did my research. There are many sources who would say that Dwayne Dixon is the leader of this network. There are two sources that I can think of right now.” 
  
 Holmes also asked Howley about a statement he published that “Dixon mostly carried out his activist plots in anonymity until Charlottesville,” asking Howley if he “had any knowledge of anonymous plots that Mr. Dixon participated in.” After deflecting by referencing events in Charlottesville and at the Silent Sam protests, Howley finally conceded that one “source said Mr. Dixon was acting anonymously prior to Charlottesville and him being exposed in Charlottesville forced him to change his strategy.” His final testimony dropped any reference to “plots” prior to Unite the Right. 
  
 Howley acknowledged on the stand that he was put on suspension from Breitbart News for four days, prior to founding Big League Politics. 
  
 “And that incident working with Breitbart News had to do with an incident where a reporter was accusing someone else of assaulting them,” Holmes said. “Isn’t that correct?” 
  
 Howley acknowledged the incident, in which he expressed skepticism in a series of tweets about the allegation that Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski assaulted his Breitbart colleague Michelle Fields during a campaign event in March 2016. According to screen-grabs of deleted tweets that were shared by CNN reporter Hadas Gold, Howley insinuated that Fields’s allegation was manufactured to sabotage Trump in the mainstream press.

 After initially brushing aside the question as “irrelevant,” Howley reluctantly testified that Big League Politics is partially owned by Mustard Seed Media, “which is owned by my friend, Reilly O’Neal.” Howley testified that Big League Politics receives revenue through advertisements, but when asked if the site has a list of subscribers, he responded, “I really don’t want to get into that.” 
  
 “Is it true or untrue that you have subscribers?” Cabe asked impatiently. 
  
 “True.” 
  
 “Isn’t it true that one of the sources of your revenue is selling your subscriber list to political campaigns?” Holmes asked. 
  
 “I believe it is possible. You’d have to ask my business partner.” 
  
 O’Neal, a Raleigh-based political consultant who owns Tidewater Strategies, could not be reached for comment. Tidewater Strategies has worked on campaigns for far-right Republican candidates, including Greg Brannon, who ran for the U.S. Senate against Thom Tillis in the 2014 primary; Corey Stewart, who decisively lost his U.S. Senate race this year in Virginia to Democrat Tim Kaine; Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore; and Paul Nehlen, who unsuccessfully sought to replace House Speaker Paul Ryan in Wisconsin’s First Congressional District. 
  
 Howley has publicly sought to play down his right-wing ideological orientation. “I consider myself to be an independent,” he testified. “I consider myself to be a populist and a citizen. I’m not a conservative or a liberal.” 
  
 Tidewater Strategies is more straightforward about its orientation. “We are a full-service political consulting firm working exclusively with conservative candidates and organizations across the country,” its website announces. 
  
 Some of the messaging in the campaigns that O’Neal has worked on align with Big League Politics’ drumbeat of coverage promoting the idea of antifascists being violent and out of control. In response to an inquiry from WBTV 3 in Charlotte, O’Neal acknowledged that he helped set up a political action committee called Principled Leadership Project, which ran a controversial ad in support of Republican Karen Handel during the 2017 special election to fill the vacant Sixth Congressional District seat in Georgia. 
  
 The ad, which ran after a Bernie Sanders supporter shot Republican U.S. Representative Steve Scalise at a congressional baseball game, urged voters to “stop” Handel’s opponent, Democrat Jon Ossoff, while claiming that the “unhinged left is endorsing and applauding shooting Republicans.” “When will it stop?” a narrator asks. “It won’t if Jon Ossoff wins on Tuesday, because the same unhinged leftists cheering last week’s shooting are all backing Jon Ossoff. And if he wins, they win.” 
  
 Fritsch, the cameraman who accompanied Howley to confront Dixon inside an academic building in February, is also a political consultant, who, like O’Neal, has worked on the Nehlen, Stewart, and Moore campaigns. 
  
 Howley gave a contradictory explanation of Fritsch’s involvement with Big League Politics during his testimony. 
  
 “Does he work for Big League Politics?” Holmes asked. 
  
 “No, he’s my friend,” Howley said. “He works with me. … Yes, I suppose you could say he’s a photographer for Big League Politics.” 
  
 “You just said he wasn’t,” Holmes said. 
  
 “Well, I changed my answer. He is.” 
  
 Howley was listed as a witness in the charging document for the August 20 incident but was not called to testify. 
  
 After Judge Cabe’s dismissal of Dixon’s charge, Howley stood up in the courtroom and walked out, uttering aloud: “Unbelievable. Wow.” 
  
 As Dixon and his supporters were leaving, Howley returned with his cell phone. Howley turned on his camera near the courthouse’s security checkpoint and started filming Dixon as he stood near the front entrance. Howley’s question was predictable. 
  
 “Can I ask you a question now about Charlottesville?” he asked. 
  
 “Can we get an officer of the court to intervene here please?” Dixon asked. 
  
 Frustrated once again, Howley turned his ire on the court system, and the mainstream media. 
  
 “Obviously it was rigged on a technicality, but the facts are clear that Dwayne Dixon did assault me and he is a very violent person,” Howley said. “And I think that people in Chapel Hill are put in harm’s way by the radical, violent riots he and his friends cause on campus and elsewhere in this country. And until the media, sir—until the media starts reporting on this violence, we’re not gonna be able to come together and have rational conversations in this country because we’re just gonna descend into street fighting out there. And is that what the media wants? That’s not what I want.” 
  
 Howley and Big League Politics gave ample coverage about the case in the run-up to the trial. Since the verdict, both the site and its editor’s Twitter account have remained silent about the charge’s disposition. ||||| Lawyers for James Alex Fields, 21, the Ohio man charged with the first-degree murder of Heather Heyer and accused of plowing his Dodge Challenger into a crowd of demonstrators on Fourth Street August 12, 2017, suggested he may argue self defense in early questioning of potential jurors. 
  
 Fields, a self-described neo-Nazi, is also charged with five counts of aggravated malicious wounding, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of leaving the scene. He appeared in court unshaved and wearing a dark suit and tie. 
  
 The case—and the swarms of white supremacists and neo-Nazis in the streets of Charlottesville for the Unite the Right rally—made national news. Fields’ attorney, former commonwealth’s attorney Denise Lunsford, earlier had requested a change of venue. Judge Rick Moore took the motion under advisement, but seemed confident he could find 12 impartial jurors and four alternates. 
  
 Questionnaires went out to 360 potential jurors, the largest pool ever in Charlottesville, and by 10am November 26, around 60 were sitting in Charlottesville Circuit Court. 
  
 Jury selection got off to a slow start. Potential jurors were put in a group of 28 for the first round of questioning to determine juror bias. One was dismissed because she no longer lived in Charlottesville. 
  
 Nearly all of the 28 raised their hands when asked if they’d heard about the case through the media. 
  
 The prosecution said it planned to call 40 witnesses, including victims Marcus Martin and Marissa Blair, and former Daily Progress reporter Ryan Kelly, whose photo of the Fourth Street crash won a Pulitzer prize. 
  
 Lunsford listed around 15 possible witnesses, including Officer Tammy Shifflett, the school resource officer who left her position blocking Fourth Street at Market when she became fearful for her personal safety, and Fields’ mother, Samantha Bloom, who has called police in the past because she was frightened by her son’s behavior. 
  
 The trial is expected to last three weeks. |||||","– It looks like the man accused of deliberately ramming his car into a crowd of people in Charlottesville will try to sway jurors with a self-defense strategy. Lawyers for James Fields suggested as much Monday as jury selection got underway in the closely watched murder trial in Virginia, reports C-ville. For one thing, attorney John Hill asked potential jurors their views on whether violence could be justified in cases of self-defense, reports the Daily Progress, which notes that University of North Carolina professor Dwayne Dixon is on the witness list. Dixon is affiliated with the Antifa movement, and he has publicly talked about seeing Fields on the block he was patrolling shortly before the crash. In a speech at Harvard, Dixon said Fields ""paused right in front of me, and I waved him off with my rifle,"" per IndyWeek. Far-right conspiracy theorists have used Dixon's comments to make the case that Fields was fleeing when he drove into the crowd, per the Daily Progress. Prosecutors plans to show jurors video showing that Fields backed up, then accelerated into the counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. Also on the witness list: an officer, one who normally worked as a school resource officer, who left her position before the crash because she feared for her personal safety. The trial is expected to last three weeks, though jury selection could take days."
"WASHINGTON—Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R., N.C.) has decided against a proposal circulating quietly on Capitol Hill to create criminal penalties for companies that decline to comply with court orders to decipher encrypted communications, a spokeswoman said Thursday night. 
  
 The issue of how to pressure companies on encryption matters has become inflamed in Washington in recent days. Several people familiar with the matter previously said Mr. Burr was considering criminal provisions as part of the proposal.... ||||| Neither Hillary Clinton nor Bernie Sanders was willing to pick a side Thursday in the heated battle between the FBI and Apple over the government’s demand that the company create new, less secure software to comply with a warrant. 
  
 The tech giant made headlines on Wednesday with its forceful response to a federal judge’s court order that it help the government break into an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino killers, Syed Farook. 
  
 When Democratic town hall host José Díaz-Balart asked Sanders, “Whose side are you on?” Sanders replied: “Both.” 
  
 “I am very fearful in America about Big Brother. And that means not only the federal government getting into your emails or knowing what books you’re taking out of the library, or private corporations knowing everything there is to know about you in terms of your health records, your banking records, your consumer practices,” Sanders said. 
  
 “On the other hand, what I also worry about is the possibility of another terrorist attack against our country. And frankly, I think there is a middle ground that can be reached.” 
  
 Clinton called the situation a “difficult dilemma.” She discussed some of the main concerns Apple has “about opening the door, creating what they call a backdoor into encryption.” And she pointed out that the capability could be abused by authoritarian regimes like “the Chinese, Russian, Iranian governments” who want the same kind of access. 
  
 But she concluded with a favorite law enforcement talking point: that the smart people in America can surely solve this problem and find a way to help the FBI access encrypted communications with a little brainstorming and teamwork. “As smart as we are, there’s got to be some way on a very specific basis we could try to help get information around crimes and terrorism,” she said. Technologists refer to this as the “magic pony” solution. 
  
 Try as the two candidates might, however, there really isn’t a middle ground to occupy — either in the war between Apple and the FBI, or when it comes to the use of unbreakable encryption generally. 
  
 Technologists almost unanimously agree that there’s no secure way to insert a backdoor into their products without undermining security and exposing data to criminals and hackers. 
  
 And Apple CEO Tim Cook, supported by a growing legion of cryptologists, scientists, and other tech companies, said Wednesday that acceding to the government “would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.” 
  
 If Apple is forced to build a new way to hack its own product, the genie would be out of the bottle — the U.S. government could ask for it to do so again, and other governments could demand the same. Apple users would no longer have confidence that their data is secure, and presumably, other companies would soon find themselves in the same position. ||||| NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) will likely seek to invoke the United States’ protections of free speech as one of its key legal arguments in trying to block an order to help unlock the encrypted iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters, lawyers with expertise in the subject said this week. 
  
 The company on Thursday was granted three additional days by the court to file a response to the order. Apple will now have until Feb. 26 to send a reply, a person familiar with matter told Reuters. 
  
 The tech giant and the Obama administration are on track for a major collision over computer security and encryption after a federal magistrate judge in Los Angeles handed down an order on Tuesday requiring Apple to provide specific software and technical assistance to investigators. 
  
 Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook called the request from the Federal Bureau of Investigation unprecedented. Other tech giants such as Facebook Inc (FB.O), Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google have rallied to support Apple. 
  
 Apple has retained two prominent, free-speech lawyers to do battle with the government, according to court papers: Theodore Olson, who won the political-speech case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010, and Theodore Boutrous, who frequently represents media organizations. 
  
 Government lawyers from the U.S. Justice Department have defended their request in court papers by citing various authorities, such as a 1977 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld an order compelling a telephone company to provide assistance with setting up a device to record telephone numbers. 
  
 The high court said then that the All Writs Act, a law from 1789, authorized the order, and the scope of that ruling is expected to be a main target of Apple when it files a response in court by early next week. 
  
 But Apple will likely also broaden its challenge to include the First Amendment’s guarantee of speech rights, according to lawyers who are not involved in the dispute but who are following it. 
  
 Compared with other countries, the United States has a strong guarantee of speech rights even for corporations, and at least one court has ruled that computer code is a form of speech, although that ruling was later voided. 
  
 Apple could argue that being required to create and provide specific computer code amounts to unlawful compelled speech, said Riana Pfefferkorn, a cryptography fellow at Stanford University’s Center for Internet and Society.

 The order against Apple is novel because it compels the company to create a new forensic tool to use, not just turn over information in Apple’s possession, Pfefferkorn said. “I think there is a significant First Amendment concern,” she said. 
  
 A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles declined to comment on the possible free-speech questions on Thursday. 
  
 A speech-rights argument from Apple, though, could be met with skepticism by the courts because computer code has become ubiquitous and underpins much of the U.S. economy.

 “That is an argument of enormous breadth,” said Stuart Benjamin, a Duke University law professor who writes about the First Amendment. He said Apple would need to show that the computer code conveyed a “substantive message.” 
  
 In a case brought by a mathematician against U.S. export controls, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers California, found in 1999 that the source code behind encryption software is protected speech. The opinion was later withdrawn so the full court could rehear the case, but that rehearing was canceled and the appeal declared moot after the government revised its export controls. 
  
 The FBI and prosecutors are seeking Apple’s assistance to read the data on an iPhone 5C that had been used by Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, carried out the San Bernardino shootings that killed 14 people and wounded 22 others at a holiday party. 
  
 U.S. prosecutors were smart to pick the mass shooting as a test case for an encryption fight with tech companies, said Michael Froomkin, a University of Miami law professor. That is because the shooting had a large emotional impact while also demonstrating the danger posed by armed militants, he said. 
  
 In addition, the iPhone in dispute was owned not by Farook but by his employer, a local government, which has consented to the search of the iPhone. The federal magistrate who issued the order, Sheri Pym, is also a former federal prosecutor. 
  
 “This is one of the worst set of facts possible for Apple. That’s why the government picked this case,” Froomkin said. 
  
 Froomkin added, though, that the fight was enormously important for the company because of the possibility that a new forensic tool could be easily used on other phones and the damage that could be done to Apple’s global brand if it cannot withstand government demands on privacy. “All these demands make their phones less attractive to users,” he said. ||||| The news this week that a magistrate ordered Apple to help the FBI hack an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooter suspects has polarized the nation—and also generated some misinformation. 
  
 Those who support the government say Apple has cooperated in the past to unlock dozens of phones in other cases—so why can't it help the FBI unlock this one? 
  
 But this isn't about unlocking a phone; rather, it's about ordering Apple to create a new software tool to eliminate specific security protections the company built into its phone software to protect customer data. Opponents of the court’s decision say this is no different than the controversial backdoor the FBI has been trying to force Apple and other companies to build into their software—except in this case, it's an after-market backdoor to be used selectively on phones the government is investigating. 
  
 The stakes in the case are high because it draws a target on Apple and other companies embroiled in the ongoing encryption/backdoor debate that has been swirling in Silicon Valley and on Capitol Hill for the last two years. Briefly, the government wants a way to access data on gadgets, even when those devices use secure encryption to keep it private. 
  
 Apple specifically altered its software in 2014 to ensure that it would not be able to unlock customer phones and decrypt any of the most important data on them; but it turns out it overlooked a loophole in doing this that the government is now trying to exploit. The loophole is not about Apple unlocking the phone but about making it easier for the FBI to attempt to unlock it on its own. If the controversy over the San Bernardino phone causes Apple to take further steps to close that loophole so that it can't assist the FBI in this way in the future, it could be seen as excessive obstinance and obstruction by Capitol Hill. And that could be the thing that causes lawmakers to finally step in with federal legislation that prevents Apple and other companies from locking the government out of devices. 
  
 If the FBI is successful in forcing Apple to comply with its request, it would also set a precedent for other countries to follow and ask Apple to provide their authorities with the same software tool. 
  
 In the interest of clarifying the facts and correcting some misinformation, we've pulled together a summary of the issues at hand. 
  
 What Kind of Phone Are We Talking About? 
  
 The phone in question is an iPhone 5c running the iOS9 version of Apple's software. The phone is owned by the San Bernardino Department of Public Health, which gave it to Syed Rizwan Farook, the shooter suspect, to use for work. 
  
 What Is the Issue? 
  
 Farook created a password to lock his phone, and due to security features built into the software on his device, the FBI can't unlock the phone and access the data on it using the method it wants to use—a bruteforce password-guessing technique wherein they enter different passcodes repeatedly until they guess the right one—without running the risk that the device will lock them out permanently. 
  
 How Would It Do That? 
  
 Apple's operating system uses two factors to secure and decrypt data on the phone–the password the user chooses and a unique 256-bit AES secret key that's embedded in the phone when it's manufactured. As cryptographer Matthew Green explains in a blog post, the user's password gets ""tangled"" with the secret key to create a passcode key that both secures and unlocks data on the device. When the user enters the correct password, the phone performs a calculation that combines these two codes and if the result is the correct passcode, the device and data are unlocked. 
  
 To prevent someone from brute-forcing the password, the device has a user-enabled function that limits the number of guesses someone can try before the passcode key gets erased. Although the data remains on the device, it cannot be decrypted and therefore becomes permanently inaccessible. The government's motion to the court (.pdf) notes that this happens after 10 failed guesses when the auto-erase feature is enabled by the user. 
  
 The government says it does not know for certain if Farook's device has the auto-erase feature enabled, but notes in its motion that San Bernardino County gave the device to Farook with it enabled, and the most recent backup of data from his phone to iCloud ""showed the function turned on."" 
  
 A reasonable person might ask why, if the phone was backing data up to iCloud, the government can't just get everything it needs from iCloud instead of breaking into the phone. The government did obtain some data backed up to iCloud from the phone, but authorities allege in their court document that he may have disabled iCloud backups at some point. They obtained data backed up to iCloud a month before the shootings, but none closer to the date of the shooting, when they say he is most likely to have used the phone to coordinate the attack. 
  
 Is This Auto-Erase the Only Security Protection Apple Has in Place? 
  
 No. In addition to the auto-erase function, there's another protection against brute force attacks: time delays. Each time a password is entered on the phone, it takes about 80 milliseconds for the system to process that password and determine if it's correct. This helps prevent someone from quickly entering a new password to try again, because they can only guess a password every 80 milliseconds. This might not seem like a lot of time, but according to Dan Guido, CEO of Trail of Bits, a company that does extensive consulting on iOS security, it can be prohibitively long depending on the length of the password. 
  
 ""In terms of cracking passwords, you usually want to crack or attempt to crack hundreds or thousands of them per second. And with 80 milliseconds, you really can only crack eight or nine per second. That's incredibly slow,"" he said in a call to reporters this week. 
  
 With a four-digit passcode, he says, there are only about 10,000 different combinations a password-cracker has to try. But with a six-digit passcode, there are about one million different combinations a password cracker would have to try to guess the correct one—a simple six-digit passcode composed of just numbers would take a couple of days to crack, Guido says; but a more complex six-character password composed of letters and numbers could take more than five-and-a-half-years, according to Apple. The iOS9 software, which appears to be the software on the San Bernardino phone, asks you to create a six-digit password by default, though you can change this requirement to four digits if you want a shorter one. 
  
 Later models of phones use a different chip than the iPhone 5c and have what's called a ""secure enclave"" that adds even more time delays to the password-guessing process. Guido describes the secure enclave as a ""separate computer inside the iPhone that brokers access to encryption keys"" increasing the security of those keys. 
  
 With the secure enclave, after each wrong password guess, the amount of time you have to wait before trying another password grows with each try; by the ninth failed password you have to wait an hour before you can enter a tenth password. The government mentioned this in its motion to the court, as if the San Bernardino phone has this added delay. But the iPhone 5c does not have secure enclave on it, so the delay would really only be the usual 80 milliseconds in this case. 
  
 Why None of This Is an Issue With Older iPhones 
  
 With older versions of Apple's phone operating system—that is, phones using software prior to iOS8—Apple has the ability to bypass the user's passcode to essentially unlock the device and access data on the phone. It has done so in dozens of cases over the years, pursuant to a court order. But beginning with iOS8, Apple changed this so that it securely encrypts all of the most important data on your phone by default—photos, messages, contacts, call history—using the password you choose. And Apple cannot bypass your password to obtain that data. 
  
 According to the motion filed by the government in the San Bernardino case, the phone in question is using a later version of Apple's operating system—which appears to be iOS9. We're basing this on a statement in the motion that reads: ""While Apple has publicized that it has written the software differently with respect to iPhones such as the SUBJECT DEVICE with operating system (""iOS"")9, Apple yet retains the capacity to provide the assistance sought herein that may enable the government to access the SUBJECT DEVICE pursuant to the search warrant."" 
  
 The government is referring to the changes that Apple made with iOS8 that exist in iOS9 as well. Apple released iOS9 in September 2015, three months before the San Bernardino attacks occurred, so it's very possible this is indeed the version installed on the San Bernardino phone. 
  
 After today, technology vendors need to consider that they might be the adversary they're trying to protect their customers from. 
  
 What Does the Government Want? 
  
 A lot of people have misconstrued the government's request and believe it asked the court to order Apple to unlock the phone, as Apple has done in many cases before. But as noted, the particular operating system installed on this phone does not allow Apple to bypass the passcode and decrypt the data. So the government wants to try bruteforcing the password without having the system auto-erase the decryption key and without additional time delays. To do this, it wants Apple to create a special version of its operating system, a crippled version of the firmware that essentially eliminates the bruteforcing protections, and install it on the San Bernardino phone. It also wants Apple to make it possible to enter password guesses electronically rather than through the touchscreen so that the FBI can run a password-cracking script that races through the password guesses automatically. It wants Apple to design this crippled software to be loaded into memory instead of on disk so that the data on the phone remains forensically sound and won't be altered. 
  
 Note that even after Apple does all of this, the phone will still be locked, unless the government's bruteforcing operation works to guess the password. And if Farook kept the iOS9 default requirement for a six-digit password, and chose a complex alpha-numeric combination for his password, the FBI might never be able to crack it even with everything it has asked Apple to do. 
  
 Apple CEO Tim Cook described the government's request as ""asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers—including tens of millions of American citizens—from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals. The same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe."" 
  
 What Exactly Is the Loophole You Said the Government Is Exploiting? 
  
 The loophole is the fact that Apple still retains the ability to run crippled firmware on a device like this without requiring the user to approve it, the way software updates usually work. If this required user approval, Apple would not be able to do what the government is requesting. 
  
 How Doable Is All of This? 
  
 Guido says the government's request is completely doable and reasonable. 
  
 ""They have to make a couple of modifications. They have to make it so that the operating system boots inside of a RAM disk…[and] they need to delete a bunch of code—there's a lot of code that protects the passcode that they just need to trash,"" he said. 
  
 Making it possible for the government to test passwords with a script instead of typing them in would take a little more effort he says. ""[T]hat would require a little bit of extra development time, but again totally possible. Apple can load a new kernel driver that allows you to plug something in over the [Lightning] port… It wouldn't be trivial but it wouldn't be massive."" 
  
 Could This Same Technique Be Used to Undermine Newer, More Secure Phones? 
  
 There has been some debate online about whether Apple would be able to do this for later phones that have newer chips and the secure enclave. It's an important question because these are the phones that most users will have in the next one or two years as they replace their old phones. Though the secure enclave has additional security features, Guido says that Apple could indeed also write crippled firmware for the secure enclave that achieves exactly what the FBI is asking for in the San Bernardino case. 
  
 ""It is absolutely within the realm of possibility for Apple themselves to tamper with a lot of the functionality of the secure enclave. They can't read the secure private keys out of it, but they can eliminate things like the passcode delay,"" he said. ""That means the solution that they might implement for the 5c would not port over directly to the 5s, the 6 or the 6s, but they could create a separate solution for [these] that includes basically crippled firmware for the secure enclave."" 
  
 If Apple eliminates the added time delays that the secure enclave introduces, then such phones would only have the standard 80-millisecond delay that older phones have. 
  
 ""It requires more work to do so with the secure enclave. You have to develop more software; you have to test it a lot better,"" he said. ""There may be some other considerations that Apple has to work around. [But] as far as I can tell, if you issue a software update to the secure enclave, you can eliminate the passcode delay and you can eliminate the other device-erase [security feature]. And once both of those are gone, you can query for passcodes as fast as 80 milliseconds per request."" 
  
 What Hope Is There for Your Privacy? 
  
 You can create a strong alpha-numeric password for your device that would make bruteforcing it essentially infeasible for the FBI or anyone else. ""If you have letters and numbers and it's six, seven or eight digits long, then the potential combinations there are really too large for anyone to bruteforce,"" Guido said. 
  
 And What Can Apple Do Going Forward? 
  
 Guido says Apple could and should make changes to its system so that what the FBI is asking it to do can't be done in future models. ""There are changes that Apple can make to the secure enclave to further secure their phones,"" he said. ""For instance, they may be able to require some kind of user confirmation, before that firmware gets updated, by entering their PIN code … or they could burn the secure enclave into the chip as read-only memory and lose the ability to update it [entirely]."" 
  
 These would prevent Apple in the future from having the ability to either upload crippled firmware to the device without the phone owner's approval or from uploading new firmware to the secure enclave at all. 
  
 ""There's a couple of different options that they have; I think all of them, though, are going to require either a new major version of iOS or new chips on the actual phones,"" Guido said. ""But for the moment, what you have to fall back on is that it takes 80 milliseconds to try every single password guess. And if you have a complex enough password then you're safe."" 
  
 Is the Ability to Upload Crippled Firmware a Vulnerability Apple Should Have Foreseen? 
  
 Guido says no. 
  
 ""It wasn't until very recently that companies had to consider: What does it look like if we attack our own customers? What does it look like if we strip out and remove the security mitigations we put in specifically to protect customers?"" 
  
 He adds: ""Apple did all the right things to make sure the iPhone is safe from remote intruders, or people trying to break into the iPhone.… But certainly after today, technology vendors need to consider that they might be the adversary they're trying to protect their customers from. And that's quite a big shift.""

 NEW YORK (AP) — Police and prosecutors in New York City said Thursday that the top-notch encryption technology on Apple mobile phones is now routinely hindering criminal investigations. And they predicted the problem could grow worse as more criminals figure out how well the devices keep secrets. 
  
 Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said at a news conference that investigators cannot access 175 Apple devices sitting in his cybercrime lab because of encryption embedded in the company's latest operating systems. 
  
 ""They're warrant proof,"" he said, adding that the inability to peer inside the devices was especially problematic because so much evidence once stored in file cabinets, on paper, and in vaults, is now only on criminals' smartphones. 
  
 Apple has marketed its encryption data as an important privacy tool, and many privacy advocates have praised the company, saying that if it opened its devices to government surveillance that ability to spy on users could be abused in places with authoritarian regimes. 
  
 ""There is no magic key that only good guys can use and bad guys cannot,"" said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil liberties organization. 
  
 ""Any vulnerability Apple is forced to create in its phones can and will be exploited by criminals making all less secure,"" Cohn said. ""This is really a question of security versus surveillance."" 
  
 Apple, based in Cupertino, California, is currently fighting a federal magistrate's order to help the FBI hack into an iPhone used by a gunman in December's mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. An Apple spokesman did not immediately return a call Thursday for comment on the concerns of New York City authorities. 
  
 Vance didn't specify which cases were being hindered. But Police Commissioner William Bratton said a phone seized in the investigation of the shooting of two police officers in the Bronx last month is among those detectives can't crack. It was displayed Thursday alongside other phones, iPads and tablets similar to 600 devices the prosecutor's team tested, of which the 175 proved inaccessible. 
  
 Bratton said criminals are increasingly aware of the protection offered by their devices. He said a prisoner in a city jail was recently recorded saying in a phone call that iPhone encryption was ""another gift from God."" 
  
 Vance said investigators have relied on phone data to investigate killings, child pornography, robbery and identity theft. He said that might include checking a suspect's contact list to get the names of witnesses or conspirators, or viewing incriminating videos and photographs. 
  
 Apple CEO Tim Cook has warned that creating software allowing the FBI to unlock the San Bernardino suspect's phone could make millions of other phones vulnerable to hackers and criminals. 
  
 Cook said that if Apple were forced by the courts to ""hack our own users,"" the government could order the company to build surveillance software to intercept all sorts of messages, ""access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone's microphone or camera without your knowledge."" |||||","– It's a battle that could shape the future of technology, and Facebook has chosen a side: The company issued a statement on Thursday signaling that it supports Apple in its refusal to crack an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. Facebook condemns terrorism, the company said in a statement, but it will ""continue to fight aggressively against requirements for companies to weaken the security of their systems."" Earlier, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted: ""We stand with @timcook and Apple (and thank him for his leadership)!"" In related coverage: The New York Times looks at how the Apple-FBI showdown was more than a year in the making—and how it was foreshadowed by a clash over a meth dealer's phone. Wired dives deep into the technical issues involved and explains why the feds may never be able to get into the phone, even if Apple does everything they want it to. Reuters speaks to legal experts about the case, one of whom notes that the San Bernardino case presents the ""worst set of facts possible for Apple"" to have to defend its encryption policy under. The Wall Street Journal reports on the reaction on Capitol Hill, where Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr was rumored to be looking at introducing criminal penalties for companies that buck court orders on encrypted communications. When the issue came up at a Democratic town hall on Thursday night, neither Hillary Clinton nor Bernie Sanders would pick a side, even though ""there really isn't a middle ground to occupy,"" the Intercept reports. The AP reports that at a Thursday press conference, police and prosecutors warned that Apple encryption was hindering investigations, with scores of ""warrant proof"" devices now gathering dust in a cybercrime lab. (A law from 1789 is central to the government's case.)"
"New York (CNN) -- As weekend temperatures soared over 90 degrees Fahrenheit, New York City saw a sudden increase in shootings, with 26 people felled by bullets in 72 hours -- seven fatally. ""When we have hot temperatures, we see that the crime rate seems to go up,"" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Monday. But Bloomberg emphasized that for the year, shootings are down in the city -- 127 since January 1, which is 40 less than the same period in 2012. ""One shooting is one too many, but last week we had the fewest shootings in a decade, including this weekend's shootings,"" Bloomberg noted. A professor says the heat index and the crime rate can connect. ""Lifestyle differences exist between cold weather and warm weather,"" says James Alan Fox, a professor of Criminology, Law and Public Policy at Northeastern University in Boston. Fox has conducted research on the possible connection between temperature and crime. His findings illustrate how these lifestyle differences can contribute to varying levels of violent crime. ""In cold weather, particularly in blizzards, people stay indoors, and the violent crime rate is lower. When the weather is warm, people are interacting more with others, be they friends, family, or strangers, so there are increased opportunities for conflict,"" Fox says. Fox says this trend continues except when it gets incredibly hot, so unbearable that even criminals become lethargic. ""When it gets to be in the high 90s, especially over 100 degrees, people just go indoors and look for air conditioning,"" Fox said. However, drawing any conclusions about this past weekend may be premature, says Professor Jon M. Shane, assistant professor in the Department of Law, Police Science, and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay Criminal College. ""I would not put too much emphasis on a single spike in weather and the uptick shootings,"" Shane said. ""The reality is that you do not have enough information from this single episode to conclude that hot weather is related to increases in crime--specifically shootings, in this case."" In November 2012, New York City logged a record-breaking ""murder-free Monday"" when there was not a single reported slaying, stabbing, shooting or knifing in any of the five boroughs, according to the New York Police Department. ""It is unusual in a city of 8 million people, but we never read that much into one day,"" said Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne, who said it was the ""first time in memory"" that the city had such a lull in violent crime. At the close of 2012, Bloomberg hailed New York City the ""safest big city in America,"" giving the NYPD credit. ""The fact that the safest big city in America is safer than ever is a testament to the hard work and determination of the men and women who put their lives on the line for us every day -- and it also reflects our commitment to doing everything possible to stop gun violence,"" Bloomberg said. CNN's Chris Boyette and Adam Reiss contributed to this report.","Bloomberg: ""When we have hot temperatures ... the crime rate seems to go up""
But year-to-date, shootings are down in New York City .

"A spa manager received third-degree burns when a scented candle set light to acetone she was using to clean an elderly woman's nails. Julia McKeown, who works at the four-star Dalmeny Hotel in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, was badly burned on her hands, arms, chest and stomach and had to spend three months in hospital having skin grafts after the accident. Today Blackpool Magistrate's Court heard Mrs McKeown, 38, also suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. The customer, 96-year-old Mary Heyworth, was unharmed. Julia McKeown (pictured, left) was burned on her hands, arms and chest after a scented candle set light to acetone she was using to clean a customer's fingernails . The accident happened when Mrs McKeown spilled the chemical on herself and the candle. Staff rushed to help her but she suffered third-degree burns and had to have skin grafts . The accident happened in January last year when Mrs McKeown spilled acetone on herself during a spa treatment in the pool area of the hotel. Mrs McKeown was engulfed in flames after the liquid also spilled on to a scented tea light candle which was being used in a decorative lantern. Staff rushed to help her and managed to put out the flames, but Mrs McKeown was already very badly burned. Michael Hayton QC, prosecuting, said: 'Mrs Mc Keown the salon manager was using a pad soaked in acetone from a two and a half litre bottle. 'The bottle spilled and splashed on the beautician’s arms and body and the table.She and her clothing ignited from the naked flame of a tealight type of candle which was lit and placed in a open topped lantern. 'Staff went to her aid but she had to undergo extensive skin grafts some of them full depth. 'The local council investigated and found a a the hotel company failed in its duty to protect its employees.There was no training and no supervision when it came to using what is known to be a significantly hazardous product. 'The investigation showed there had been previous spillages of acetone and the company had been previously warned about health and safety issues.' The accident happened in January last year at the four-star Dalmeny Hotel in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire . Fining Dalmeny Hotel Ltd £16,000 and ordering the company to pay £9,075 in costs, District Judge Joanne Hirst said: 'The woman suffered significant and horrific burns to her body. 'She has suffered a loss of self esteem as a result and her marriage has been affected, as has her social life. 'The hotel failed to heed earlier warnings about health and safety. There had been previous problems with the use of acetone and a systematic failure in safety and risk to staff.' Charles Lavery, defending, said: 'The directors of the hotel deeply regret what happened. They believe the size of the bottle their member of staff purchased was unsuitable to use to take off nail varnish. 'After the incident, caused by failings which conspired together, the company brought in health and safety consultants and has totally addressed any problems.' Mrs McKeown, who has worked at the spa since 2006, is now back at work but has launched a compensation claim against her employers.","Julia McKeown, 38, was using a bottle of acetone to clean a woman's nails .

"(CNN) -- Several years ago, Satwant Singh Kaleka put a large American flag in the front of his yard, raising the eyebrows of his children, who thought it might be considered an eyesore. Kaleka pointed out there were no homes nearby with flags, and he wanted to show that the United States was a land of opportunity, said his son, Amardeep Kaleka. The elder Kaleka, 65, served as president of the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Milwaukee, scene of Sunday morning's mass shooting. He was one of six community members killed. Sikhs react to the Wisconsin temple shooting . ""He lived the American dream,"" Amardeep Kaleka told CNN. His father brought his family to the United States with little money but a strong work ethic in the early 1980s. The flag also was a form of protection for the family, Satwant Kaleka told them. It stood at half-staff Monday evening as the family grieved. The six killed in Sunday's attack were identified by police as five men -- Kaleka; Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; Prakash Singh, 39, and Suveg Singh, 84 -- and a woman, 41-year-old Paramjit Kaur. ""She was a good woman. She was a great mom,"" said Kaur's son, Harpreet Saini, 18. Kaur and her family immigrated to the United States eight years ago. ""She lived for us. She worked for us. Anything she did, it was for us,"" said her older son Kamal Saini, 20. ""If there wasn't enough to eat it was always us before she ate."" When Kaur was in the temple praying on Sunday, ""My aunt told her that there was a shooting going on outside, we need to get up and leave,"" said Kamal Saini. ""Rather than just getting up and leaving, she wanted to just bow down and pray for the last time and then get up and leave. She was just getting up. She was shot in the back."" Her dream was for her sons to be educated. ""She told us education is everything here,"" said Kamal Saini. His mother's death ""took my world away,"" he said. Both young men plan to pursue careers in law enforcement. ""I wanted her to see me in uniform,"" Kamal Saini said. Another victim, Suveg Singh, spent every day at the temple, said his granddaughter, Sandeep Khattra. ""He is always there, and he's with the community and anybody who is willing to listen,"" said Khattra. ""He educated them about our religion."" Belief blog: Who are Sikhs? The victim's family told CNN they will return to their temple. His son, Baljander Singh Khattra, said Suveg Singh was friendly and a ""very strong person."" Prakash Singh was a priest who recently immigrated to the United States with his wife and two young children, said Justice Singh Khalsa, a temple member since the 1990s. Amardeep Kaleka said people called to tell him that his father saved many lives Sunday. The son said he was not surprised his father tried to stop the gunman at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin. ""It's an amazing act of heroism, but it's also exactly who he was,"" Amardeep Kaleka told CNN Milwaukee affiliate WTMJ. ""There was no way in God's green Earth that he would allow somebody to come in and do that without trying his best to stop it."" Remembering the victims . Amardeep Kaleka said the FBI told him his father attacked the shooter in the lobby, resulting in a ""blood struggle."" A knife close to the victim's body showed blood on it, he said. ""From what we understand, he basically fought to the very end and suffered gunshot wounds while trying to take down the gunman,"" said Kanwardeep Singh Kaleka, Satwant's nephew. Satwant Kaleka's wife, Satpal, hid with several other women, telling them to remain quiet during the horrific incident. The gunman came into the kitchen and shot and wounded two women, she told CNN. ""I grabbed everybody and said run, run to the pantry."" Amardeep Kaleka said his father worked hard and was an honest man. ""I would love for them (the public) to know that he lived his life with the principles that he knew and he was taught at a young age. It made him highly successful in America."" President Barack Obama signed a proclamation honoring the victims, ordering that U.S. flags be flown at half-staff at federal facilities and buildings. Vigils were held Monday night, and one is set for Tuesday. The Sikh temple in Brookfield, northwest of Oak Creek, was to hold a candlelight vigil late Monday. The Rev. Paul Armstrong of Oak Creek Community United Methodist Church, site of a Monday evening prayer vigil, said the diverse array of faiths in the community have an opportunity to further deepen bonds. ""There's a few of us who will be calling folks together to organize some more interfaith services,"" he told CNN. Opinion: An American tradition of bigotry . ""Being in mission to the world is something we share,"" Armstrong said of his faith and the Sikh community. ""Their hospitality is wonderful. That is something the Christian community is called to do."" The vigil was held outdoors, and a survivor of the temple shooting spoke, according to Armstrong. ""The focus was to express our sorrow and that all of us can be lights of the world,"" he said. Navdeep Singh, a policy adviser to the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund, says Sikhs believe in freedom of religion, community service and inclusiveness. At temples, or gurdwaras, where Sikhs hold services, everyone is welcome. ""You can come and be equal,"" he says. Opinion: Sikh temple shooting is act of terrorism .

"By . Sara Malm . A top television executive has taken the blame for a public street fight with his best friend, Australia’s third richest man, outside a luxury apartment complex at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Sunday. David Gyngell, 47, chief executive of Nine Entertainment, has said he started the brawl with billionaire casino mogul James Packer, 46, at the latter's home in the exclusive Sydney suburb. Despite Mr Gyngell admitting he instigated the fight, and that no complaints have been made, police are now investigating the incident which was captured on camera and widely published in newspapers across Australia this morning. Mischief managed: David Gyngell, left, has admitted he started the fight with his billionaire best friend James Packer, pictured right on Tuesday with a black eye, at Packer's luxury apartment block in Sydney . Mr Gyngell and Mr Packer’s fathers revolutionised the television industry in Australia and as well as being best friends since high school, they were each other’s best men at their weddings. Mr Gyngell’s television company, The Nine Network, later broadcast a statement where he accepted blame for the fight on the curb outside James Mr Packer’s flat on Sunday. ‘David Gyngell respects the job police do and will cooperate fully with their investigation,’ the statement said. ‘He also fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident,’ it said. ‘Clearly had he not turned up at Mr Packer's premises in an angry mood, then the confrontation would never have occurred.’ The morning after: TV boss David Gyngell leaves James Packer's Bondi Beach house on Monday, the day after the fight . Looking a bit better: James Packer's shiner had cleared up on Tuesday afternoon when he was pictured out in Sydney with his mother Roz . News Corp., headed by Mr Packer and Mr Gyngell’s long-time friend Lachlan Murdoch, reportedly paid more than $200,000 for pictures of the outside Mr Packer's luxury apartment at Bondi Beach on Sunday. James Packer is chairman of Crown Resorts and has interests in casinos in Australia, Macau and Manila. Forbes lists him as Australia's third-richest person worth an estimated $6.6 billion and he is allegedly dating supermodel Miranda Kerr. It is said that the fight started after Mr Packer sent angry texts to Mr Gyngell after seeing a van from the latter’s television channel parked near his apartment and assumed Nine were trying to catch him and Miss Kerr together. Nine employee Nick Tokic later told . reporters that he lived near Mr Packer and had brought the van home . overnight for an early job Monday morning. Mr . Packer had just returned home to Sydney from Jerusalem and was met by . an angry Mr Gyngell blocking his driveway when he arrived at his flat. Cause of it all? Packer is said to have become angry when he thought a TV van from Gyngell's network was trying to catch him with his alleged new girlfriend, supermodel Miranda Kerr, pictured with her son Flynn in Sydney on the day of the fight .

"Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) -- It was supposed to be an ordinary night out with friends for 20-year-old Zukiswa Gaca but it ended with her lying on a railway track attempting to take her own life. Gaca was at a bar, drinking with friends in Khayelitsha township, less than 40 kilometers outside Cape Town, South Africa, when a man tried to ask her out. ""I told the guy that no I'm a lesbian so I don't date guys and then he said to me, 'no I understand. I've got friends that are lesbians, that's cool, I don't have a problem with that.'"" Gaca says he was nice and she trusted him, and they left the bar to go to the home of one of his friends, and that is where his friendly exterior turned nasty. ""He said to me, 'you know what? I hate lesbians and I'm about to show you that you are not a man, as you are treating yourself like a man,'"" she told CNN. ""I tried to explain 'I'm not a man. I never said I'm a man, I'm just a lesbian'. And he said, 'I will show you that I am a man and I have more power than you.'"" Then he raped her, she says, as his friend watched. Gaca said: ""[Afterwards] I went to the railway train road, because I was suicidal at the time. I was lying on the tracks. I think the train was 100 meters away from where I was. Then some other guy came and grabbed me. The train passed. He called the police."" It is called ""corrective rape"" - where men force themselves on lesbians, believing it will change their sexual orientation. The extent of the problem is hard to know as South African police do not compile corrective rape statistics separately from other rape cases. But human rights groups in the country -- where gay rights are constitutionally protected -- are outraged. Cherith Sanger, of the Women's Legal Centre in Cape Town, which provides legal support for rape victims who cannot afford good lawyers, said: ""We believe that corrective rape warrants greater recognition on the basis that there are multiple grounds of discrimination. ""It's not just about a woman being raped in terms of violence against women, which is bad enough, but it's also got to do with sexual orientation so it's another ground or level of unfair discrimination leveled against lesbians."" It was not the first time Gaca had been raped. She says she ran away from her home village, in the rural Eastern Cape, after the first rape when she was 15 years old and too afraid to press charges. She says running was easier than dealing with a community that didn't accept lesbians. She moved to Khayelitsha Township, a sprawling shanty town near Cape Town, Africa's ""gay capital"" where she hoped to find tolerance. Instead, she was confronted by more hate. ""Being a lesbian in Khayelitsha is like you are being treated like an animal, like some kind of an alien or something,"" she said. While there are no official statistics on corrective rape, there have been enough publicly reported incidents to spark widespread alarm. This time Gaca is fighting back. New York-based Human Rights Watch recently conducted interviews in six of South Africa's nine provinces and concluded: ""Social attitudes towards homosexual, bisexual, and transgender people in South Africa have possibly hardened over the last two decades. The abuse they face on an everyday basis may be verbal, physical, or sexual -- and may even result in murder."" The group added: ""This is a far cry from the promise of equality and non-discrimination on the basis of 'sexual orientation' contained in the country's constitution."" Most known victims, like Gaca, are poor and black and so are the perpetrators, prompting many to ask how a people who fought against discrimination during apartheid can today treat some of its most vulnerable in such a violent manner. Siphokazi Mthathi, South African director at Human Rights Watch, said: ""We've failed to make it understood that there is a price for rape. Sexism is still deeply embedded here. There is still a strong sense among men that they have power over women, women's bodies and there's also a strong sense that there's not going to be consequences because most often there are no consequences."" Interpol estimates that half of South African women will be raped in their lifetime. But corrective rape is not even recognized as a hate crime and rights groups say few victims report their cases to the police. But Gaca did. In many African countries being gay is illegal. In South Africa, those entrusted with enforcing the country's ""tolerant laws"" now stand accused of re-traumatizing victims. ""When a woman is raped she is re-raped by the system and for me this is a big thing because it's a serious violation of our constitution and the duties that are placed on the state in terms of what the state needs to do for survivors,"" Sanger said. CNN saw the treatment meted out to survivors firsthand with Gaca as she trekked from police station to police station trying to first find, and then get answers from, her investigating officer. He was the third assigned to her case since she reported the attack in December 2009 and she eventually found him at the sexual offences unit in Bellville, a 30-minute drive from her home. Despite the sensitive nature of her case, he met her in the wide, open office. When Gaca asked why the police had failed to interview her alleged attacker's friend, who witnessed the rape, another officer in the room told her: ""I never take a statement from a suspect's friend."" He added: ""The suspect's friend is obviously going to say you are in a relationship with the suspect or that he didn't see anything. The only statements that are important here are the ones from your friend, a neutral person or a neighbor. Not someone who was there watching while you were being damaged and he wasn't helping."" CNN requested an interview with the investigator and was referred to his superiors, before being granted an interview with South Africa's Minister of Police, Nathi Mthethwa, who promised an investigation. ""I feel bad,"" the minister said. ""I feel bad about all these things. That is why I'm saying people who are responsible have a case to answer."" No action has so far been taken against the police officers who not only treated Gaca with disdain but who she also had to push every step of the way to do their job. When they let her alleged attacker go without taking DNA evidence, potentially crucial in proving his guilt, it was Gaca who insisted they re-arrest him. After neglecting to question the eyewitness who was allegedly there throughout the incident, it was Gaca who forced the police to talk with him. She says she sat in a car while they questioned him, as he leaned in through an open window to tell the police officer what he saw of the assault, forcing Gaca to once again relive the experience. South Africa's Victims' Charter was drafted in 2004, granting seven fundamental rights to every victim of crime. Among them is the right to be treated with fairness and with respect to your dignity and privacy. Gaca says these rights are ideals she has never experienced. Yet she's determined to press on. She said: ""They always get away with it. I'm just pushing so that there will be a different story on my case. Maybe if this guy could be sentenced or something happens to him I think a lot of my friends will report their cases because some of the lesbians, they don't report their cases, they don't go to the police station because they know that it will just be a waste of time."" Nearly two years after reporting her case, Gaca is still awaiting her day in court, still hoping for justice, and still fighting.","In South Africa the full scope of 'corrective rape' is not known because cases are not separated from other forms of rape .

"FIFA vice president Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan has announced that he is to stand for the presidency of the world governing body. Prince Ali, who is also a member of the FIFA Executive Committee and the head of the Jordan Football Association, will stand against incumbent Sepp Blatter and Frenchman Jerome Champagne for the top job in May this year. 'I am seeking the presidency of FIFA because I believe it is time to shift the focus away from administrative controversy and back to sport,' he said in a statement on www.jfa.com. FIFA vice president Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan will run for football's top job . 'This was not an easy decision. It came after careful consideration and many discussions with respected FIFA colleagues over the last few months. 'The message I heard, over and over, was that it is time for a change. The world's game deserves a world-class governing body - an International Federation that is a service organisation and a model of ethics, transparency and good governance.' Blatter has held his position as FIFA president since 1998 and will be running for a fifth term at the 65th FIFA congress in Zurich on May 29. The governing body has been engulfed by controversy in recent months over the decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar. Prince Ali will challenge Sepp Blatter (right), who is running for a fifth term as FIFA president . American lawyer Michael Garcia produced a 430-page report into the bidding for the tournaments but quit as FIFA's ethics investigator after losing his appeal challenging the findings to clear Russia and Qatar to host the World Cups. The Executive Committee agreed unanimously in December that an 'appropriate' form of the Garcia report into World Cup bidding should be published. Officials at a meeting in Morocco agreed to the proposal without a vote being taken - but nothing will be published until the Ethics Committee charges against three FIFA ExCo members - Angel Villar Llona of Spain, Belgium's Michel D'Hooghe and Thailand's Worawi Makudi - have been dealt with. 'The headlines should be about football, not about FIFA,' Prince Ali added. 'FIFA exists to serve a sport which unites billions of people from all over the world, people of differing and divergent political, religious and social affiliations, who come together in their enjoyment of ""the world's game"".' Football Association chairman Greg Dyke said: 'Personally I welcome Prince Ali's decision to stand for the FIFA presidency. It is very important that there is a credible candidate standing against Mr Blatter and Prince Ali is certainly that.' FA chairman Greg Dyke, pictured in July, has welcomed Prince Ali's decision to stand against Sepp Blatter . Prince Ali has served as president of the Jordan Football Association since 1999 and a year later founded the West Asian Football Federation which consists of 13 different nations. The 39-year-old was educated in the US at the Salisbury School in Connecticut, where he impressed as a wrestler, before moving to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK. He's served as a pathfinder in the Jordanian Special Forces and graduated from Princeton University in 1999. Ali is married to Algerian-born Rym Brahimi, now Princess Rym, who previously worked as a journalist for CNN and is the daughter of UN diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi. They have two children. Frenchman Jerome Champagne will also challenge to end Blatter's reign, which began in 1998 . Among his achievements in football is his championing of the lifting of FIFA's ban on the hijab in the women's game. Ali was among those FIFA officials who have called for the publishing of the Garcia report. Champagne is a former FIFA deputy secretary general. Nominations have to be made before January 31.","Vice president Prince Ali of Jordan to run in FIFA president election .

"(CNN) -- A dry and mild spring led Don Villwock, like all of Indiana's corn and soybean farmers, to plant two weeks early this year. He was hopeful for a bountiful Labor Day harvest. But the rain didn't fall and June brought blistering heat. Now, as punishing drought grips the Midwest, Villwock, 61, walks his hard-hit 4,000 acres in southwest Indiana in utter dismay. Where there should have been tall, dark green, leafy plants, there now stand corn stalks that are waist high or, at best, chest high. They are pale in color and spindly. Fragile. Tired. Pull back an ear's husk and you find no kernels, he says. With temperatures rising above 95 degrees, the pollen starts to die. ""It's emotionally draining,"" he said. ""The crop got out of the ground very well. We were so optimistic. But maybe a few of us were counting our eggs before they were hatched."" The costs of America's worst drought in 24 years is obvious to Villwock, who has been farming for four decades. They are not so apparent to American consumers -- at least, not yet. But down the line, people are certain to be paying more for food this year. Authorities have declared more than 1,000 counties in 26 states as natural disaster areas. A county is generally qualified as a natural disaster area if it has suffered severe drought for eight consecutive weeks. Farmers are then eligible for low-interest emergency loans from the Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency. Is the drought hitting your area? Let us know how you're coping on CNN iReport. As of Tuesday, 61% of land in the lower 48 states was experiencing drought conditions -- stretching from Nevada to South Carolina -- the highest percentage in the 12-year record of the U.S. Drought Monitor. The parched conditions come after some areas of the United States suffered record-setting heat waves, killer storms and blazing wildfires. In America's Corn Belt, the prognosis for farmers is grim as fields and pastures become drier by the day. Villwock says the drought is already larger in scope than in 1988, and he fears it will intensify to become worse. Many areas in the southern Midwest are reporting the poorest conditions for June since 1988. Corn prices pop after lower production forecast . ""In the hottest areas last week, which were generally dry, crop conditions deteriorated quickly,"" writes Rich Tinker, author of the Drought Monitor. He says 30% of the corn crop in the 18 primary corn-growing states is now in poor or very poor condition, up from 22% the previous week. Half of America's pastures and ranges are in poor or very poor condition, up from 28% in mid-June, he says. Think it's hot? Imagine living here . The sizzling conditions have also led to a dramatic increase in wildfire activity since mid-June, shortly after the High Park Fire ignited near Fort Collins, Colorado. During the past three weeks, acres scorched by wildfires went up from 1.1 million to 3.1 million. The past 12 months have been the warmest the United States has experienced since the dawn of record-keeping in 1895, the National Climatic Data Center said earlier this week. In Indiana, with water reservoirs at low levels, a mandatory water ban began Friday at noon in Indianapolis in hopes of saving an additional 25 million gallons a day. The ban mainly affects lawn watering. At Bilskie's Market in Indianapolis, owner Jim Bilskie says he has offered customers local produce for 40 years. This year, he's paying more for fruits and vegetables and says he has to pass on the costs. ""The cost is high now,"" Bilskie told CNN affiliate WTHR. ""The wholesaler isn't making money. The cost is going up. We're not making money. It's outrageous."" Mother nature's kill list . Iowa farmer Dave Miller, 60, has not seen rain in 21 days. His corn looked good until about two weeks ago when the soaring temperatures turned killer. ""I'm about 50 percent short of needed moisture,"" he said. ""In parts of southern Indiana, southern Illinois, they have been much drier for a longer period. We looked good, compared to them."" At this stage, Miller needs 2 inches of rain right away to carry his corn crop as well as his soybeans, which will start aborting pods without adequate moisture. It will be challenging for many farmers, who often pay $800 to $1,000 per acre to plant a crop. Consumers will be hurting as well down the line when they feel the drought in their pocketbooks, says Miller, who is also the director of research and commodity services at the Iowa Farm Bureau. Corn prices have climbed 45% already, Miller says; soybeans, 22%. ""In the short run, that doesn't show up in the grocery store,"" he said, since most of this corn is used as livestock feed. In fact, he said, meat prices could fall at first if farmers slaughter more animals to decrease the cost of buying feed. But eventually, Americans will pay more at the checkout counter. ""It's likely that in three to six months from now, you will start seeing an increase in prices in the meat case,"" Miller said. ""There will be a quicker impact on eggs and poultry because the production cycle is shorter."" And even milk could see 4% to 6% price hikes if there are reductions in dairy herds. Villwock, the Indiana farmer, says he must wait now until the fall of 2013 before he can hope for a full harvest. Harsh weather affects everyone, but farmers are especially at the whim of Mother Nature, he says. Meanwhile in Iowa, the forecast Friday included a 30% chance of rain, filling many hearts with hope. But last time Miller checked his radar, not one drop had fallen on his 350 acres.

"He is among several lawmakers to express frustration after three Republican senators opposed a bill to scale back parts of the US health law.
The so-called ""skinny"" repeal is the Senate's third failed attempt to roll back Obamacare.
It is considered a blow to Republicans who vowed for years to repeal the law.
The legislation fell apart during the early hours on Friday, when Arizona Senator John McCain cast the decisive vote to reject the bill by 51 to 49 in the Republican-dominated Senate.
He joined Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins in opposing the plan.
An estimate from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found the ""skinny"" repeal would have resulted in 16 million people losing their health insurance by 2026, with insurance premiums increasing by 20%.
Mr Ryan said Republicans ""should not give up"" on the plan, but added that he would now turn his attention to overhauling the tax code.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, described the result as a ""disappointing moment"".
He continued: ""It's time to move on.""
Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks blamed Mr McConnell for the failure, telling CNN ""the leadership at the top is responsible. The buck stops there"".
""If Mitch McConnell cannot get the job done on this, how is he going to get the job done on the rest of President Trump's agenda over the next three and a half years?"" he asked.
Mr Brooks added that Mr McConnell should pressure the Senate to pass a new version of former President Barack Obama's signature law - the Affordable Care act - or step down.
Iowa Congressman singled out Mrs Murkowski and Mr McCain for the loss.
He said Mrs Murkowski ""was initially appointed to her position by her father"" and that her write-in campaign in 2010 ""was essentially a revolt"" against Republican primary voters.
Mrs Murkowski was elected to her fourth term last year.
Congressman Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, was among several lawmakers to share his disappointment on Twitter.
Texas Senator John Cornyn tweeted it was up to Democrats now to protect Americans from a market collapse.
Iowa Senator Joni Ernst tweeted she was ""disappointed"" the Senate could not repeal the ""flawed law"" while Georgia Senator David Perdue blamed ""an unworkable budget process and politicians who put their political self-interests ahead of national interest"".
""The American people should be outraged and should demand real change now,"" he said in a statement. ""It is extremely important that we get this fixed.""
But Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich applauded Mr McCain, Mrs Murkowski and Mrs Collins in a tweet on Friday, saying ""Courage is contagious"".
President Trump lamented the failed vote during a speech at Suffolk County Community College in New York on Friday afternoon, but added ""you can't have everything"".
He told the crowd he said from the beginning to ""let Obamacare implode"" first and then repeal it.
""I turned out to be right,"" he added.
A spokesman for Mr Obama weighed in on the debate on Friday, praising those who ""mobilised, organised and made their voices heard"".
""President Obama still believes that it is possible for Congress to demonstrate the necessary bipartisanship and political courage to keep delivering on the promise of quality, affordable health insurance for Americans,"" Kevin Lewis said in a statement.
Meanwhile, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer lauded the three senators who voted against the bill.
""I have not seen a senator who speaks truth to power as strongly as well as frequently as John McCain,"" he said at a news conference on Friday.
He also called Mrs Collins and Mrs Murkowksi tough women and said he spoke to Speaker Ryan on Friday about working on bipartisan legislation.

Instead of beating the drum for healthcare reform, the administration has been all over the map.
A hastily announced ban on transgender individuals in the armed forces, issued by presidential tweet. A press conference to herald efforts to combat gang violence. A campaign-style rally in Ohio with a focus on the threats of illegal immigration. A speech to a Boy Scouts gathering that was heavy on media bashing.
In case that wasn't enough, over the past week the administration has been beset by internecine warfare. Mr Trump publicly questioned the effectiveness of his former campaign confidant, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, subjecting him to an increasingly angry barrage of tweets.

The bill - officially known as the Health Care Freedom Act - would have eliminated parts of Obamacare, including the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance coverage or pay a fine, and the employer mandate, which requires the same of companies with 50 employees or more.
It also would have temporarily repealed a tax on medical devices, defund the US women's group Planned Parenthood for a year and provide more money to community health centres, as well as given states more flexibility in complying with Obamacare regulations.
But the pared-down measure would have left much of Obamacare untouched, including the expansion of Medicaid, a government health programme for the poor that faced deep cuts in earlier proposals.
A requirement that all insurance plans cover essential health benefits, federal subsidies to help consumers pay for insurance as well as taxes on wealthy Americans also would have remained in place.
The stripped down bill came after earlier Senate defeats for proposals to replace Obamacare and then to partially repeal it.
Mr McCain said he had voted against the skinny repeal because it did not amount to meaningful reform and would not have improved care for Americans.
There are not thought to be any further plans for a new bill to repeal Obamacare because the skinny repeal was seen as the only measure Republicans could get through Congress.
However, lawmakers could revive the issue and take it up later in the year.
Following the vote, President Trump tweeted: ""As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal.""
Mr Trump's position on healthcare reform has varied - he has spoken out at various points for Obamacare being repealed, repealed and replaced, or being allowed to collapse by itself.
In his statement, Mr McCain said Obamacare was in a state of ""collapse"", with healthcare premiums ""skyrocketing"" and providers ""fleeing the marketplace"".
He criticised the way Obamacare had been passed by Democrats using their Obama-era majority and called for senators to ""return to the correct way of legislating"" with input from both parties.
""We must do the hard work our citizens expect of us and deserve,"" he said.
But Texas Senator Ted Cruz insisted the fight was not over.
""Mark my words, this journey is not yet done,"" he said.","Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he is ""disappointed and frustrated"" by the Senate's failure to repeal the Obama-era healthcare act."

"Donna Savigar was eating breakfast at a Newcastle-under-Lyme branch of McDonald's when she found a screw in her sausage and egg McMuffin (above) A grandmother who discovered a metal screw in her £3.39 McDonald's breakfast is 'outraged' after staff did not offer her a refund. Donna Savigar ordered a sausage and egg McMuffin at a Newcastle-under-Lyme branch of the fast food chain around 9.45am on Friday. The 45-year-old was three-quarters of the way through her sandwich when she felt metal crunch between her teeth and spat out a screw. Donna's daughter Dayna Bennett, 20, went to complain about the dangerous nail - but staff said they could only make her a fresh one. Ms Savigar, who works for a charity, said: 'I could have ended up choking to death - imagine if it had happened to a child. 'A child would start choking and you wouldn't know what to do because you certainly wouldn't be expecting them to have swallowed a screw in the middle of McDonald's. 'I don't see why they don't just pay up. All I was looking for was a refund.' The mother-of-one, from Halmer End, said she complained to headquarters but couldn't receive a refund until they had done a thorough investigation. She added: 'They need to train staff to deal with that sort of situation. A manager needs to come over and deal with it. 'We weren't offered a refund and we weren't even told how we could go about complaining to McDonald's about it, we had to Google that for ourselves. Scroll down for video . 'I had already eaten three-quarters of the burger when I felt something weird in between my teeth. 'Your first instinct is to spit it out, so I did, and I couldn't believe it. It was about an inch big and quite fat.' The mother-of-one (above), from Halmer End, said she complained to headquarters but couldn't receive a refund until they had done a thorough investigation . Ms Bennett, who works as a carer and lives in Alsagers Bank, Stoke-on-Trent, said: 'It was absolutely outrageous. 'Imagine if it had been a child who ate it, they could have choked to death. Donna's daughter Dayna Bennett (left above), 20, went to complain about the dangerous nail - but staff did not offer a refund and instead suggested making a fresh McMuffin . 'We had gone in for a quick breakfast because we were going out shopping for the day. Mum was eating her McMuffin and then started making a funny face and then spat out the nail. 'I took a picture straight away so no one could say we had planted it there and then took the McMuffin back to the counter. 'They just took it away, I don't know what they did with it. Then they just asked if we wanted a fresh one. 'I said no and went back over to my mum. I couldn't believe they hadn't offered us a refund, but we didn't go and ask again because we just wanted to get out of there by that point. 'I've never been to McDonald's before and I won't be going back.' McDonald's confirmed it is investigating. A spokesman said: 'We are sorry for Ms Bennett's experience when visiting our restaurant. 'Food safety and quality are our highest priority and both our restaurants and our suppliers place great emphasis on quality control and follow rigorous standards in order to avoid imperfections in our products. 'An investigation is underway following the reporting of this incident and our Customer Service department will be in touch with Ms Bennett to keep her updated.'

One of the animals required urgent help after it was found dragging barbed wire from its leg and mane. But despite the state of the animals the council has so far been powerless to remove the horses and appeals to the owner have been ignored. Both the RSPCA and South Tyneside Council are trying to resolve the issue but the owner has so far refused a notice demanding he remove his horses from the public land.

Men may believe that whizzing around in an expensive set of wheels is the way to a woman's heart, but they couldn't be more wrong. The stereotype that women are turned on by flashy cars is in tatters as new research has shown that, while 48 per cent of men are convinced an expensive car makes them more attractive to the opposite sex, women actually labelled drivers of expensive sports cars as arrogant, self-centred and dangerous. New research aimed to establish whether the type of car you drive actually does influence perceptions - and the results could make you think twice before buying your next car. Sorry, Lewis Hamilton! Women label drivers of sports cars as 'arrogant, self-centred and dangerous' While men might believe a sports car gives them the edge, women overwhelmingly associated the drivers of these cars with more negative personality traits. Meanwhile, men tended to most associate negative personality traits with drivers of 4x4s, viewing owners of these vehicles as arrogant, rude, and self-centred. By comparison, women felt that saloon drivers (like Ford Mondeo, Renault Megane, VW Passsat) were likely to be hard working and safe drivers, while hatchback drivers were seen as being modest. Both sexes attributed the most positive personality types with eco- car drivers (such as Nissan Leaf, Toyota Prius), naming them as the most likely to be conscientious, intelligent and also the safest drivers on the road. Despite being one of the most difficult colours to keep clean, the research found that black is the car colour that is most likely to turn someone’s head. Not so fast! While men might believe a sports car gives them the edge, women overwhelmingly associated the drivers of these cars with more negative personality traits and prefer those who drive eco-friendly cars . The research suggests that the perfect car for a man looking to attract a partner would be a black eco-car, such as a Toyota Prius or Nissan Leaf. Phill Jones, a spokesman for Motors.co.uk, who carried out the research, said: 'Our survey provided an interesting snapshot into how people perceive car drivers, with the bad boy sports car stereotype still holding true. 'The disparity between men and women suggests that the yummy mummy “Chelsea tractor” stereotype might be having a similar effect on men as sports cars appear to be having on women. 'While there is no doubt that owning the Batmobile or a Back to the Future Delorean would be a conversation starter if you’re looking to meet new people, in reality the car we buy is likely to make us feel more confident rather than make other people find us more attractive.'

Four people have been arrested on suspicion of involvement in a spate of attempted letter bomb attacks in Northern Ireland and England, including on a number of Armed Forces recruitment offices. Two men, aged 35 and 46, and two women, aged 21 and 44, are being questioned over the sending of explosive devices to  careers offices in Oxford, Brighton, Canterbury, Aldershot, Reading, Chatham and Slough in February. They were detained in Londonderry and have been taken to the Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) Serious Crime Suite in Antrim. In October last year, dissident Republicans opposed to the peace process were blamed for sending a series of letter bombs to high profile political and security figures in Northern Ireland and to Army recruiting offices in England. None of the devices detonated. Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and former PSNI chief constable Matt Baggott were among those targeted by letters sent to addresses in Northern Ireland . In the Northern Ireland attacks, one of the devices was sent to Stormont Castle in Belfast addressed to Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers. Another bomb was delivered to the offices of the Public Prosecution Service in Londonderry while another two explosive packages - one addressed to then PSNI chief constable Matt Baggott and the other to one of his senior commanders - were intercepted at Royal Mail offices in Belfast and Lisburn. The sending of bombs in the post marked the re-emergence of a terror tactic that was used by paramilitaries during last half of the 20th century in a period known as the Troubles. Since 2009, republican extremists intent on achieving a united Ireland by violent means have murdered two soldiers, two policemen and one prison officer in Northern Ireland, as well as carrying out numerous other attacks on security force targets. The Army Recruitment Centre at The Queensmere Centre in Slough was one of those targeted in the attacks .

The cyclist shot dead in the Alps may have been the ‘main target’ of the massacre, French police say – not the British al-Hilli family. Investigators made the extraordinary claim as Sylvain Mollier, who worked in the nuclear industry, was ‘temporarily buried’ in a secret ceremony yesterday. This went against the wishes of the 45-year-old’s family, who had asked for him to be cremated. Crime scene: The bullet-riddled BMW where the bodies of Saad al-Hilli, his wife, Iqbal, and mother-in-law Suhaila Al-Allaf were discovered along with his daughters Zeena and Zainab . It is believed forensic experts still want to examine his body for clues, which would have been impossible if the remains had been destroyed. Just 30 people attended the funeral, . which took place at 6.30pm last night - a day when the burial site is normally closed. It was deliberately . kept hidden from the media, employees told French broadcaster RTL. French investigators are examining the theory that he may have led a ‘double life’ and been the intended target of the shooting. Until now the investigation had focused on the deaths of British aerospace engineer Saad al-Hilli, 50, his wife Ikbal, 47, and his mother-in-law Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, who were shot in the countryside near Annecy in their BMW estate car. Mr al-Hilli’s seven-year-old daughter Zainab was discovered badly beaten by a passing British cyclist shortly after the attack. Burial: Relatives of Sylvain Mollier at Ugine Funeral Home after police refused to allow them to cremate him as they continued their investigation . Her four-year-old sister, Zeena, was found unscathed hiding under her dead mother’s skirt eight hours later. The family, from Claygate, Surrey, had been camping near Lake Annecy when they were attacked. Victim: Saad al-Hilli, 50, the father murdered near the village of Chevaline, near Lake Annecy, in the Haute-Savoie region of France . It had been thought that Mr Mollier was killed because he witnessed the shootings as he cycled past. But Lt Colonel Benedict Vinnemann, who is leading the gendarme inquiry, revealed he was considering other possibilities. He said: ‘Was the al-Hilli family the main target? Was it not the cyclist? Only ongoing work on the scene can answer this question clearly. ‘We’re talking about someone whom everybody says was a gentleman, but who’s to say he did not lead a double life?’ Mr Mollier worked for Cezus, a subsidiary of the Areva Group, specialising in zirconium metalworking for nuclear fuel containers. Cezus is owned by the Areva group which in 2007 was forced to deny a report in Der Spiegel that it had flouted UN sanctions by providing Iran with enriched uranium. He lived in Ugine, close to the isolated beauty spot on the edge of the village of Chevaline where the shootings took place. He had two teenage boys from a previous marriage while his second wife, a pharmacist, gave birth in June. Mr Mollier was still on paternity leave and had been using his spare time to cycle around the countryside. He was identified after his partner, worried about not seeing him return, alerted the police. The two survivors, Zainab and Zeena, are back in Britain and are believed to have been reunited at a secret location near London. They are being closely protected, amid fears that whoever was responsible for the attack may try to harm them.","Sylvain Mollier worked in the nuclear industry, specialising in zirconium metal-working for nuclear reactors .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Spinning wind turbines might soon be confined to the recycling bin. That's because German company Festo have revealed their innovative design for a new wind turbine that can operate even in low wing conditions. Known as the DualWingGenerator, it uses . two pairs of wings to generate power even when the wind speed drops to . nine miles (14 km) per hour. Scroll down to watch video . The product is part of Festo's Bionic Learning Network and mimics the natural beating of a bird's wings. As one wing rises the other drops so that they help each other move even when the wind speed is low. The shape of the wings means they generate lift when wind passes over them. The motion of the wings is turned into electricity by an integrated circuit motor. As one wing rises the other falls, so it can operate even in conditions when wind speed is low . But it's the effectiveness of the turbine to operate at low wind speeds that really makes it impressive. It's possible that it could one day be used as an alternative to modern wind turbines. Festo's DualWingGenerator is the first flapping turbine of its kind . The DualWingGenerator is an evolution of Festo's SmartBird. The SmartBird's revolutionary design allows it to start, fly and land autonomously. Its wings not only beat up and . down, they also twist at specific angles, providing the ultra-light . model with 'excellent aerodynamic qualities and extreme agility'. Controlled by a radio handset, it can also simply glide through the skies if left to its own devices. Steering is achieved when the SmartBird, which weighs just 450 grams, moves its tail and turns its head from side-to-side. Inspired . by the herring seagull, scientists at technology firm Festo control the . up/down flapping motion of the wings by spinning two wheels inside the . robot's torso.","German company Festo has unveiled their DualWingGenerator .

"Regina Hungerford, 55, denied striking the 17-year-old when she lost her temper as he listened to music in her classroom at Merthyr Tydfil College.
She previously had a common assault conviction quashed on appeal, saying the notebook was slammed on the desk.
But on Friday, the Education Workforce Council ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and was unacceptable.
It will decide whether to strike her off the register at a later date.
Panel chairman Gareth Roberts said: ""There was a momentary lapse of control and in that moment Mrs Hungerford acted in breach of teaching principles.
""It put at risk the public trust in the profession and her conduct fell far short of the standard expected of a registered teacher.
""Pupil A's behaviour was difficult to manage but we have concluded she acted in an inappropriate way.""
During the hearing, Mrs Hungerford's lawyer Adam Ohringer said her ""calm and patient"" experience with challenging students meant she would not have struck the boy.
""She readily accepts she lost her temper in response to his behaviour,"" he said.
""She slammed the notebook down on the desk as a sign of her anger.
""It is something she regrets but as far as she can say she didn't make contact with him and certainly didn't intend to make contact with him.""
Delivering the panel's ruling, Mr Roberts said, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or the hand.
They found the case against her proven.
He said the pupil's evidence was ""far from satisfactory"", adding: ""But in general terms it was credible.""

"Healthy people given the serotonin-enhancing antidepressant citalopram were willing to pay almost twice as much to prevent harm to themselves or others than those given placebo drugs 
  
 Healthy people given the serotonin-enhancing antidepressant citalopram were willing to pay almost twice as much to prevent harm to themselves or others than those given placebo drugs in a moral decision-making experiment at UCL. In contrast, the dopamine-boosting Parkinson's drug levodopa made healthy people more selfish, eliminating an altruistic tendency to prefer harming themselves over others. The study was a double-blind randomised controlled trial and the results are published in Current Biology. 
  
 The research provides insight into the neural basis of clinical disorders characterized by a lack of concern for others, such as psychopathy. Serotonin and dopamine levels have both been linked to aggressive and antisocial behavior, and this study helps explain why. 
  
 ""Our findings have implications for potential lines of treatment for antisocial behavior, as they help us to understand how serotonin and dopamine affect people's willingness to harm others for personal gain,"" says lead author Dr Molly Crockett, who conducted the study at UCL and is now at Oxford University. ""We have shown that commonly-prescribed psychiatric drugs influence moral decisions in healthy people, raising important ethical questions about the use of such drugs. 
  
 ""It is important to stress, however, that these drugs may have different effects in psychiatric patients compared to healthy people. More research is needed to determine whether these drugs affect moral decisions in people who take them for medical reasons."" 
  
 The study, conducted by researchers from UCL and Oxford University and funded by the Wellcome Trust, compared how much pain people were willing to anonymously inflict on themselves or strangers in exchange for money. A total of 175 healthy adults took part, 89 randomised to receive citalopram or placebo and 86 randomised to receive levodopa or placebo. 
  
 Participants were randomly assigned to the roles of decider and receiver and anonymously paired up such that each decider did not know who the receiver was and vice-versa. All participants were given mildly painful electric shocks matched to their pain threshold so that the intensity was not intolerable. Deciders were explicitly told that shocks to receivers would be at the receiver's own pain threshold. 
  
 Deciders went into a room alone with a computer terminal, and each took part in 170 trials. For each trial, they had to choose between different amounts of money for different numbers of shocks, up to a maximum 20 shocks and £20 per trial. For example, they might be offered a choice of 7 shocks for £10 or 10 shocks for £15. Half of the decisions related to shocks for themselves and half to shocks for the receiver, but in all cases the deciders would get the money. 
  
 At the end of the session, one of the chosen trial results would be implemented so that the decider or receiver received the shocks and the decider received the profits. As such, their decisions had real consequences. Deciders knew that their decisions would be kept secret so that fear of judgment or retaliation would not skew the results. 
  
 A similar experiment conducted by the same team previously showed that people disliked harming others more than harming themselves, a behaviour known as 'hyper-altruism'.* This behaviour was seen again in this study, with most people more willing to harm themselves than others for profit. 
  
 On average, people given a placebo were prepared to pay approximately 35p per shock to prevent harm to themselves and 44p per shock to prevent harm to others. Those on citalopram were far more harm-averse, willing to pay an average 60p per shock to prevent harm to themselves and 73p per shock to prevent harm to others. Over the course of the experiment, this meant that people on citalopram delivered an average 30 fewer shocks to themselves and 35 fewer shocks to others than those on placebo. 
  
 People given levodopa, however, were not willing to pay any more to prevent shocks to others than to prevent shocks to themselves. On average, they were prepared to pay approximately 35p per shock to prevent harm to themselves or others. This meant that they delivered on average 10 more shocks to others during the experiment than the placebo group. They were also less hesitant to deliver shocks to others, making the decision faster than those on placebo. 
  
 ### ||||| Trial showed healthy people given a Parkinson’s drug became more selfish, while people given a serotonin-boosting drug were more protective of others 
  
 Common drugs for depression and Parkinson’s can sway people’s moral judgments about harming others, according to research that raises ethical questions about the use of the drugs. 
  
 The study found that when healthy people were given a one-off dose of a serotonin-boosting drug widely used to treat depression they became more protective of others, paying almost twice as much to prevent them receiving an electric shock in a laboratory experiment. They also became more reluctant to expose themselves to pain.

 The scientists also found that the dopamine-enhancing Parkinson’s drug, levodopa, made healthy people more selfish, wiping out the normal tendency to prefer to receive an electric shock themselves, while sparing those around them. 
  
 Molly Crockett, a psychologist at the University of Oxford who led the work, said the finding that a single exposure to the drugs had such a noticeable impact on behaviour challenged the idea that we have stable moral values. 
  
 “Patients [taking these drugs] are tracked in terms of how their symptoms improve, but not necessarily in terms of how their behaviour changes,” she said. “In the treatment of Parkinson’s, some patients go on to develop compulsive gambling and compulsive sexual behaviour. The drugs have consequences that reach out into the world beyond the patient.” 
  
 She added that it was unclear whether the effects seen in the study would be replicated in patients. An alternative possibility is that the drugs could bring the behaviour of patients “back to baseline” by stabilising their psychological state. 
  
 “The central message is we need to have more research into how these drugs affect behaviour, both in healthy people and in people taking them for disorders,” she said. 
  
 In the study, published in the journal Current Biology, 175 participants took part, with 89 assigned to receive the anti-depressant citalopram or a placebo and 86 given either levodopa or a placebo. 
  
 The participants were also randomly designated as “deciders” or “receivers” and anonymously paired up. All participants were given mildly painful electric shocks matched to their pain threshold so that the intensity was not intolerable. Deciders were told that shocks to receivers would be at the receiver’s own pain threshold. 
  
 Urgent call for new drugs to treat causes of Parkinson’s Read more 
  
 Deciders went into a room alone with a computer terminal, and each took part in around 170 trials. For each trial, they had to choose between different amounts of money for different numbers of shocks, up to a maximum of 20 shocks and £20 per trial. For example, they might be offered a choice of 7 shocks for £10 or 10 shocks for £15. Half of the decisions made in the trials related to shocks for themselves and half to shocks for the receiver, but regardless of who received the shocks, the deciders would get the money. 
  
 On average, people given a placebo were prepared to pay around 35p per shock to prevent harm to themselves and 44p per shock to prevent harm to others. Those on citalopram, the seratonin-based drug, were far more harm-averse, willing to pay an average 60p per shock to prevent harm to themselves and 73p per shock to prevent harm to others. Overall, they delivered around 30 fewer shocks to themselves and 35 fewer shocks to others than those on placebo. 
  
 People given levodopa, however, were not willing to pay any more to prevent shocks to others than to prevent shocks to themselves. On average, they were prepared to pay approximately 35p per shock to prevent harm to themselves or others, meaning they delivered on average 10 more shocks to others during the experiment than the placebo group. 
  
 “The dopamine drug made people more selfish,” said Crockett. “Most people show this pattern where they think it’s worse to harm other people than to harm oneself. That’s abolished by the drug.” 
  
 The researchers suggest that in future it may be possible to give people a simple test to assess whether their decision-making behaviour has been radically altered by a drug, as well as asking them about whether their mood and symptoms have improved. 
  
 “We’re not transforming someone from a healthy person into a criminal or anything like that,” Crockett said. “But in aggregate we make decisions multiple times a day and they can shape our lives.” ||||| Your moral compass can be influenced more than you think. A new study published in Current Biology shows that using two common drugs, an antidepressant and a treatment for Parkinson’s disease, can help sway moral decisions. 
  
 The researchers randomly designated the subjects as “deciders” or “receivers,” while all the participants were given an electric shock based on their own individual pain thresholds. Deciders were to go into rooms by themselves and take part in 170 trials. Within each trial, the subject could choose from different amounts of money for a certain amount of shocks, up to 20 shocks and 20p (pence) per trial. By the end of the experiment, either the subject received an electric shock or the decision-maker got shocked, with the decision-maker getting paid either way. 
  
 The experiment randomly selects half of the group to receive the serotonin-enhancing antidepressant citalopram while the other group received levodopa, a dopamine-enhancer. Levodopa is commonly used to treat Parkinson’s disease. Each of the groups that received medication also were compared against groups who were receiving a placebo. The researchers were surprised by the potential of the findings. The goal of the experiment was to create a real life decision-making process with real consequences in order to see how these specific drugs affect behavior. 
  
 “The central message is we need to have more research into how these drugs affect behavior, both in healthy people and in people taking them for disorders,” Molly Crockett, the lead author of the research and neuroscientist at the University of Oxford told The Guardian. 
  
 In a previous experiment that was conducted by the same team, the results showed that people disliked harming others more than harming themselves. This is behavior referred to as “hyper-altruism,” a term that another study from April of 2015 states is a trait that most people have. 
  
 That was on display for this study as well. On average, the people given a placebo were prepared to pay 35p per shock to prevent harm to themselves and 44p per shock to prevent it in others. Participants who were given the citalopram were willing to pay an average of 73p per shock to prevent harm to others. Conversely, those who were given the drug levodopa were prepared to pay approximately 35p per shock to prevent harm to others or themselves, meaning that they delivered an average of 10 more shocks to others during the experiment. This gives the impression that the participants who took the drug levodopa were on average more selfish than the participants who took citalopram. 
  
 What the study also seems to indicate is that while on average most people wouldn’t inflict harm on others, with the common drug citalopram, participants were more empathetic toward other people’s pain. Lest anyone think that this study can have negative ramifications, as though serotonin-enhancing medications would begin to be doled out to everybody to “force” them to be more empathetic, this study actually might be groundbreaking for the ways in which we can treat people with mood or behavioral disorders. 
  
 “Our findings have implications for potential lines of treatment for antisocial behavior, as they help us to understand how serotonin and dopamine affect people’s willingness to harm others for personal gain. We have shown that commonly-prescribed psychiatric drugs influence moral decisions in healthy people, raising important ethical questions about the use of such drugs,” Crockett said in a statement.

A new study finds two common medications, an antidepressant and a treatment for Parkinson's disease, actually alter your moral compass, reports Medical Daily. Researchers assigned 89 healthy people a dose of the serotonin-boosting anti-depressant citalopram or a placebo, while 86 healthy people were given the dopamine-enhancing drug levodopa or a placebo. They were then separated into pairs of ""deciders"" and ""receivers."" In each of 170 trials, deciders chose to receive a certain number of mildly painful electric shocks for payment, up to 20 shocks and $30 per trial. The catch was that they also decided how many shocks would be given to the anonymous receiver, for which the decider—not the receiver—would be paid. Those who took citalopram were prepared to fork over an average equivalent of about 92 cents to avoid a shock and $1.12 to prevent harm to others, compared to 54 cents and 68 cents, respectively, from those in the placebo group. That suggests citalopram made participants more considerate of other people's pain. On the flip side, those who took levodopa were willing to pay 54 cents to prevent a shock to others or themselves.

"(CNN) -- Before he was Pope Benedict XVI, before he earned the nickname ""Cardinal No"" as the enforcer of church doctrine, he was Joseph Ratzinger -- the son of Maria and police officer Joseph Ratzinger, learning about life and God in Germany between two world wars. According to Roman Catholic doctrine, Benedict is not only the church's leader but God's representative on earth and infallible. He is also a man -- one who savors his meat and potatoes, an accomplished pianist who loves Mozart, and a teacher who for years commanded university classes. His humanity became apparent Monday, when the Vatican announced he'd resign at month's end ""because of advanced age,"" becoming the first pope in nearly 600 years to do so. After his birth on April 16, 1927, in Marktl am Inn, in southeastern Germany near the Austrian border, Ratzinger's early years were defined by his country and the turbulent times, as well as his faith. Adolf Hitler rose to power during Ratzinger's adolescent years in Traunstein, in the heavily Catholic region of Bavaria. When he was 14, school officials followed Nazi officials' orders and enrolled him and the rest of his class in the Hitler Youth movement -- against his will, Ratzinger wrote in his memoir. He left the organization shortly thereafter, because he was studying for the priesthood. But in 1943, Ratzinger was brought back into the Nazi fold upon being drafted into the German army. For the next two years, Ratzinger served his country as part of an anti-aircraft unit. But in the waning days of World War II, he deserted -- and was taken prisoner by the U.S. Army. According to CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John Allen, Ratzinger's family was strongly, if quietly, anti-Nazi and his father took a series of less significant jobs to steer clear from what was happening under Hitler. In June 1945, Ratzinger was released from a POW camp. Hitching a ride on a milk truck, he headed home. And life began anew. Opinion: Why pope will be remembered for generations . The soldier became a scholar, studying philosophy and theology at the University of Munich and another school in Freising between 1946 and 1951. Two years later, he earned a doctorate in theology, after submitting a thesis titled, ""The People and House of God in St. Augustine's Doctrine of the Church."" Eventually, he became a professor -- teaching dogma and fundamental theology at four German universities. In 1969, for instance, he was appointed vice president and professor of theology at the University of Regensburg in Germany. ""Books are his best friends,"" Allen said. All the while, he grew more ingrained in the Roman Catholic Church and its hierarchy. In 1962, 11 years after his ordination as a priest, the then-35-year-old was a consultant during Vatican II to Cardinal Josef Frings, a reformer who was archbishop of Cologne, Germany. As a young priest, Ratzinger was on the progressive side of theological debates. But he began to shift right after student revolutions of 1968, according to Allen, also a correspondent with the National Catholic Reporter. In fact, it was Ratzinger's conservative defense of strict doctrines that defined him in many people's eyes -- until he became pope. A defender of church doctrine and a 'simple, humble worker' In the late 1970s and 1980s, Ratzinger shot up the church's ranks. In spring 1977, he was named archbishop of Munich and Freising. A few months later, Pope Paul VI appointed him cardinal. One of his most significant steps up came in 1981 when he took over as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, the Vatican office that oversees ""the doctrine on the faith and morals throughout the Catholic world,"" according to the Vatican. Ratzinger became known as ""Cardinal No"" stemming from his efforts to crack down on the liberation theology movement, religious pluralism, challenges to traditional teachings on issues such as homosexuality, and calls to ordain women as priests. Liberation theology combined Christian theology with political activism on issues like human rights and social justice. While partially compatible with Catholic social teachings, it was rejected by the Vatican, which objected to the mixing of church theology with Marxist ideas such as class struggle. ""It (was) his job to police the doctrinal boundaries of the Roman Catholic Church, and inevitably when you do that, there are going to be hurt feelings by people who find themselves on the wrong side of those lines,"" said Allen, the author of ""Cardinal Ratzinger: The Vatican's Enforcer of the Faith."" Over subsequent years, he made news when, for instance, he labeled homosexuality ""an intrinsic moral evil"" and called the Soviet Union and its communist satellite nations ""a shame of our time."" In the 1990s, Ratzinger openly challenged a fellow German cardinal who had encouraged divorced and civilly remarried Catholics to return to the sacraments. Ratzinger also argued Muslim Turkey did not belong in Christian Europe and issued a document saying that Catholicism was the only true religion -- questioning the validity of other religions, even Christian ones, even as his Pope John Paul II was trying to reach out to other faiths. Although objections came from some of his fellow cardinals, the pope did not restrain Ratzinger, in part because their friendship went back four decades, to the time when the two were young priests at the Vatican II meetings in Rome. The Pope's resignation explained . That bond persevered until John Paul's death in 2005, by which time Ratzinger was dean of the College of Cardinals -- the high-level group that advises the pope and, when called upon, picks a new pontiff. In April 2005, they picked him, then 78 years old. Now called Benedict, his reputation was seen as more subdued than his predecessor. He traveled extensively, if not at John Paul's pace. His words carried special weight, as in 2006, when he quoted from 14th-century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Paleologus saying the Muslim Prophet Mohammed had only brought into the world ""things only evil and inhuman."" The remarks set off protests by Muslims worldwide, and Benedict apologized for any offense taken by Muslims. For some, the defining element of his papacy was the sex abuse scandal, with the church being accused of not doing enough to deal with reports of abuse by priests over decades, and on multiple continents. Two years after acknowledging ""shame"" over the ""evils"" of abuse, Benedict issued a statement in 2010 saying the church had not been vigilant or fast enough in responding to the problem -- one of the most forthright admissions to date, though it still did not placate some who criticized then-Cardinal Ratzinger for not cracking down sufficiently. Such missives demonstrated his power, in the church and on the world stage. But for all the headlines he generated, Benedict -- as he did in his first blessing after being elected pope -- insisted he was merely ""a simple, humble worker in God's vineyard."" ""I am consoled by the fact that the Lord knows how to work and how to act, even with insufficient tools,"" he said then, ""and I especially trust in your prayers.""","The son of a police officer, Joseph Ratzinger was born in southeastern Germany in 1927 .

"A schoolboy has been told he must stay in isolation until his 'extreme' haircut grows out, which could take months. Liam Pegg, 12, was separated from his classmates after staff ruled his 'mowhawk' style did not fit with uniform policies - despite having the cut for a year. The Year 8 pupil now has to stay in isolation and will not be allowed to go out and socialise with other students, even at break times, until his hair grows out - which could be months. But Liam's father Tim claims the youngster has had the hair cut for more than a year - and it is only now that teachers have chosen to take exception. Liam Pegg (pictured) 12, was separated from his classmates after staff ruled his 'mowhawk' style did not fit with uniform policies . Tim, a 30-year-old carpenter, said: 'His haircut is a mix of a mullet and a mohawk. He spikes up the top, but leaves the back flat for school. 'He has had this haircut for well over a year and no-one has had a problem with it before, so I don't understand why it has been raised as an issue now. 'It's hardly an extreme hairstyle. I would understand if he had dyed it bright pink and had it spiked up all over the place, but it isn't.' Liam arrived at Nailsea School, in North Somerset, on Monday to be told he was no longer allowed to attend lessons with his friends and must report to isolation. Staff at Nailsea School (pictured) ruled he would have to stay in isolation until it grows back which could take months . The school, which became an academy in September 2012 and has around 1,100 students on its roll, has been criticised for its strict dress code before . The punishment involves students being taught in a room on their own, where they are set work and supervised by a member of staff. They are not allowed to go out and socialise with other students even at break time. The case is similar to that of Anthony Mousiou who was told he must study in isolation by Samuel Ryder Academy after his short-back-and-sides was just 4.5 millimetres too short and breached their uniform policy. Liam's parents, Tim and Claire, were informed their son had been placed in the special measure indefinitely when he arrived home from school. They say Liam has had the same hairstyle since he started at the school in September 2013. Mr Pegg added: 'We only found out that he had been placed in isolation when Liam came home and told us. We had no contact from the school. Liam's father Tim claims the youngster has had the hair cut for more than a year - and it is only now that teachers have chosen to take exception . 'He has been in isolation all day, every day, since Monday. He is not in the classes he should be, socialising with other students nor taking any exercise. 'Surely this is against his human rights. When we went up to the school to discuss it we were told he would have to stay in isolation until his hair grows back. 'The headteacher said that in his opinion Liam's hair cut was inappropriate and extreme. There is no legislation relating to pupils' uniform or appearance, which is left up to school's governing bodies to decide. But schools often impose bans on 'extreme' haircuts or colours as part of their broader uniform policy. The Department of Education does advise that pupils who don't comply to uniform rules can be disciplined in accordance with the school’s published behaviour policy. A head teacher may ask a pupil to go home briefly to remedy the breach. But if the student takes longer than is strictly necessary to effect the change, then the pupil’s parents must be notified and the absence should be recorded. If a school is considering excluding a pupil in response to breaches of uniform policy then this must be in line with the legal requirements for exclusion. 'If he has to wait until his hair grows back, he could be in isolation for months. This is outrageous and is effecting his education.' The school, which became an academy in September 2012 and has around 1,100 students on its roll, has been criticised for its strict dress code before. A number of years ago it hit the headlines after it banned female students from wearing skirts after problems with ones that were too short. Head teacher Chris Wade said: 'The governors and staff at Nailsea School are united in setting high standards as we firmly believe our role is not just to enable students to pass exams, but to prepare them for life as an adult in their future work. 'It is also important to instill in students an awareness of rules so that they can be functioning members of society. I do not apologise for having these high expectations and for reserving the right to take action when our standards are not met. 'On this occasion it appears the parents disagree with the school about what is seen as acceptable but I remain open to discussing this in person with them. 'Ultimately if parents are not convinced that the rules we adhere to are of benefit to them or their children they may choose to attend another school.' When students join Nailsea School, parents sign a home/school agreement in which they promise to ensure the children follow the rules. The school's uniform policy says: 'If students arrive inappropriately dressed for school, they will in the first instance, be spoken to by their teachers and, if necessary, by their head of house. 'We reserve the right to send home any student whose clothing, hairstyle or personal appearance is inappropriate for school.'","Liam Pegg was told he must be taught in isolation until his hair grows back .

"(CNN) -- Rwandan President Paul Kagame has won re-election with 93 percent of the vote, with all districts counted, the Rwandan National Electoral Commission said Wednesday. Turnout was registered at just over 95 percent, it said. Electoral observers had expected the outcome, and Kagame claimed victory after early results gave him a huge lead in the nation's second presidential race since the 1994 genocide. Observers said the voting was peaceful and ""largely accurate."" Kagame welcomed the early results at a massive party Tuesday at the national stadium in the capital of Kigali. Thousands of supporters got free drinks and danced to live music. ""This is your victory, this is a victory for all Rwandans,"" Kagame said during the celebration speech, in vernacular Kinyarwanda. ""Our development depends on you."" Human rights groups had expressed concern over violence and repression leading up to the vote, but Salim Ahmed Salim, chairman of the Commonwealth Observation Group, lauded the polling as transparent. ""Elections in Rwanda were conducted in a peaceful atmosphere,"" Salim said. ""The count in the polling stations was transparent and conducted fairly."" But while the vote was highly organized and efficient -- thousands of people had lined up before dawn at polling stations across the country -- observers said Rwanda's democracy faces challenges that include issues of political inclusion and press freedoms. ""There was a lack of critical opposition voices,"" Salim said. ""Each case appears to be different, but the overall impact is a concern."" Of three aspiring candidates, two are under arrest and another has fled to Europe. Three other candidates cleared by Rwanda's electoral commission ran on platforms similar to Kagame's and praised him throughout their campaigns. The only representatives at many polling stations were members of the ruling party, observers said. ""That, frankly, disappointed us,"" said Salim, though he placed responsibility on the opposition parties. ""This right is a key transparency issue."" The vote comes 16 years after Rwanda's genocide left at least 800,000 people dead. Militias made up of ethnic Hutus slaughtered ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus nationwide in 100 days of violence. The killing ended when Tutsi-led militias backing Kagame ousted the Hutu government supporting the massacre. In the aftermath, Kagame transformed his country, turning it into one of the fastest growing nations in Africa and -- in the view of some -- a model of economic and social development. Kagame's administration has mixed patriotic rhetoric with strict rules in an attempt to recreate society, and recently changed the official language for schools to English, rather than French. ""Liberation is a process,"" said Tito Rutaremara, the chairman of Kagame's party, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, and also the country's ombudsman. ""We want to create the nation.""","NEW: Paul Kagame wins re-election with 93 percent of the vote .

"A revolutionary new pill for advanced skin cancer is to be trialled next year. Laboratory tests suggest that the drug is likely to be effective in melanoma patients who no longer respond to existing treatments. Known as a panRAF inhibitor, the drug may also help people with a strain of cancer that cannot be treated with standard drugs. Melanoma, or malignant skin cancer, affects around 13,000 people and causes more than 2,000 deaths in the UK each year. Scroll down for video . A revolutionary new pill for advanced skin cancer is to be trialled next year. Scientists say it is likely to be effective in patients no longer responding to existing treatments . In the U.S., the American Cancer Society estimated that it killed 9,710 people in 2014. The cancer is triggered by short, sharp bursts of sunlight and those who have been burnt at least five times are at double the risk of the disease. Surgery is always the first treatment option. But in more advanced cases patients are given drugs that suppress faulty versions of a protein called BRAF, which fuels the growth of about half of all melanomas. While BRAF inhibitors are initially very effective, the cancers generally become resistant to them within a year. The new drugs, which target a wider range of biological pathways in order to kill cancer cells,  have been shown to halt the growth of resistant tumours. They also appear to work against the 20 per cent to 25 per cent of melanomas driven by a different defective protein, RAS. Professor Caroline Springer, from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, who co-led a study, said: 'Melanomas often respond initially to the current generation of treatments, but they inevitably acquire resistance to them, and there is a desperate need for more effective options. 'Our new inhibitors are the first in a new family of drugs that attack cancers without allowing them the get-out clause of drug resistance, by blocking multiple cancer proteins at once. 'We are very hopeful that clinical trials from this series of new inhibitors will begin very soon - and that they will ultimately become new first or second-line options for patients who, at the moment, exhaust all the available treatments and end up with fatal disease.' Melanoma, or malignant skin cancer, affects around 13,000 people and causes more than 2,000 deaths in the UK each year. In the U.S., it killed approximately 9,710 people in 2014 . Her colleague, Professor Richard Marais, director of the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, based at the University of Manchester, added: 'Our laboratory study showed that these new drugs deliver multiple blows to cancer by hitting several cell survival routes at once. 'It's a step on from the drugs that are currently available which can't multitask in this way. 'The next step is testing this family of drugs in clinical trials to establish that they are both safe and effective in cancer patients, potentially providing urgently-needed new treatments for patients who have run out of options.' The trial is likely to involve a small number of patients and focus mainly on safety and dosage, although it might also produce some data about the drug's effectiveness. If you are unhappy with your looks, there is a greater risk of skin cancer, scientists have warned. A study found that people who believe they are unattractive are more likely to ‘gamble with their skin’s health’ by basking in the sun. They are also less likely to use sunscreen. The UK and US researchers say that those with low body confidence may crave a tan in the belief that the golden glow makes them look better. Alternatively, they may simply care less about their health. The finding could be used to improve advertising campaigns about the danger posed by skin cancer. Assuming the results are positive, further larger trials will look more closely at how well the drug performs. Few details of the trial are available at this stage and the number of patients due to take part is yet to be determined. But Professor Springer said funding had been agreed and an application made for ethical approval. She added: 'We're all very excited and very hopeful, because it's very important to have different therapies to offer patients who have become resistant to existing treatments.' Patients will be given one specific drug which was chosen from hundreds of candidates after rigorous testing. In the laboratory study, two drugs code-named CCT 196969 and CCT 241161 were tested. Both suppressed drug-resistant tumours from patients grown in mice without significant side-effects. Dr Richard Seabrook, of Wellcome Trust, which co-funded the research together with Cancer Research UK, said: 'Malignant melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK, with more than 13,000 people diagnosed in 2011. 'Doctors already have frontline drugs to treat melanoma, but many patients gradually develop resistance to them and are left with few other treatment options. 'This research, which discovered how two newly developed compounds could treat drug-resistant skin cancer, may give hope to the thousands who find themselves in this situation.' The study was published in the journal Cancer Cell.","Drug called a panRAF inhibitor could help advanced skin cancer patients .

"London (CNN) -- An advertisement for Marc Jacobs perfume featuring teenage actor Dakota Fanning has been banned in Britain because it ""sexualized children."" The ad, for Marc Jacobs ""Oh, Lola!"" fragrance, featured Fanning, the child star of ""War of the Worlds"" and ""I am Sam"" wearing a short dress and holding an oversized bottle of the scent in her lap. Four readers complained that the photograph -- which appeared in two British magazines in August -- was ""offensive and irresponsible,"" for showing Fanning, 17, ""in a sexualized manner."" Britain's advertising regulator, the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) agreed with the complaints, and has banned the picture from use in the UK. Coty UK, the perfume's manufacturer insisted that the ad ""did not show any private parts or sexual activity"" and said it was ""provoking, but not indecent."" But the ASA ruled that Fanning ""was holding up the perfume bottle... in her lap between her legs and we considered that its position was sexually provocative."" In a statement, it said that while it accepted that Fanning was 17, ""we considered she looked under the age of 16,"" and that her outfit and pose ""drew attention to her sexuality."" ""Because of that... we considered the ad could be seen to sexualize a child. We therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible and was likely to cause serious offense."" It is not the first time the ASA has banned advertisements featuring Hollywood stars -- in July, the watchdog ruled against a make-up ad starring Julia Roberts, on the grounds it had been airbrushed too heavily.","Ad for Marc Jacobs ""Oh, Lola!"" perfume banned in Britain .

"(CNN) -- Some people like Christmas. Some people love Christmas. And some people are so overcome by their love for the holiday season they decorate homes, gardens, even their vehicles in decorations so spectacular you have to worry about their energy bills. CNN asked people across the world to send in the most stunning and outrageous Christmas displays they had seen. We received submissions from the Dominican Republic to Russia, all of which displayed the inventiveness of people during the holiday season. The U.S., of course, is where outrageous Christmas displays have been elevated to an art form. Robert Ondrovic's image of his neighbor Kevin Lynch's house in Queens, New York, shows a house so festooned with lights and decorations it's hard to make out the front door. Lynch, a retired firefighter, reportedly used more than 300,000 lights and 350 figurines. ""I was amazed at the display, including the total amount of lights and figurines,"" Ondrovic said. ""Plus, Kevin plays Christmas music outdoors."" Read more: 9 sparkling North American Christmas markets . But the U.S. now faces stiff international competition. In the Philippines, where Christmas celebrations are taken so seriously they begin in September, the light displays are so bright they seem like they could be visible from space. iReporter Marlo Cueto took some stunning images of families enjoying a beautiful light show in Pasay City. ""I think the show's significance is to make people feel the excitement and happiness of Christmas in the middle of a busy district,"" he said. ""It brings people together, friends and families."" Meanwhile in the Caribbean, Misael Rincon sent in a series of colorful, Day-Glo shots of Christmas decorations in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. But while the decorations are playful, the sentiment behind them rings true for Misael. ""[Christmas is] a moment to share with family, the arrival of loved ones who are living outside the country,"" he said. ""[It's about] love, faith and hope for the coming of God in a humble manger."" Of course it's not just homes, stores and public spaces that benefit from a sprinkling of tinsel and fairy lights -- many like to deck out their vehicles as well. Paul Tamasi, from Cambridge, Vermont, spotted this decked out truck festooned with lights and couldn't resist taking a quick shot. ""I saw this this truck drive by my restaurant,"" the pizza parlor owner said. ""I jumped in my truck and followed it until I saw it make a stop. My hands got pretty cold capturing it!"" And decorations don't have to be massive to have an effect. Daniel Incandela started collecting quirky Christmas tree ornaments three years ago. A ""Star Wars"" Stormtrooper with a Christmas hat is one of his latest finds to festoon his Christmas tree. ""I have a fair share of decent Christmas decorations that range from Robots to a Harrods Bear to Elvis,"" he said proudly. At times the lights can serve a better, brighter purpose than merely entertaining the public.

"Mike Jones, who led Cheshire West & Chester Council until 2015, spent £4,889 on a credit card for travel, food and accommodation, and failed to provide some receipts.
The authority's rules state those type of credit card transactions are ""barred"" and receipts must be provided. A police review is also under way.
Mr Jones said he met the rules.
In February, council officials announced an internal review of Mr Jones' credit card transactions, after details of his spending were revealed by the Chester Chronicle.
The BBC has been told the review will look into why the card was used for ""subsistence, travel and accommodation"", and also why receipts were not provided on 75 occasions, after new rules were introduced in 2013.
A ""purchase card procedure"" introduced in January 2013 states it ""must not"" be used to pay for food, drinks, travel, parking or accommodation.
A list of transactions shows Mr Jones' card was used for those purposes between 2010 and 2015, as well as paying for hospitality expenses.
Mr Jones was the only councillor to own a council credit card when he ran the Conservative-led Cheshire West & Chester Council from 2009 until elections in 2015, when Labour gained control.
He is now a backbench Conservative councillor for Tattenhall.
Some of Mike Jones' expenses paid for on his council credit card include:
In total, the card was used to spend £2,383 on the ""barred"" categories after the new rules were introduced.
Mr Jones said he was given an exemption allowing him to use his card to pay for parking, adding that some of his transactions may have related to work he carried out for the Local Government Association.
Records released under the Freedom of Information Act reveal Mr Jones did not provide receipts for transactions which mostly included parking and rail travel, despite rules saying ""cardholders are required to retain all purchase receipts"".
He said: ""In all the cases where receipts are issued I have passed them into the council and if they are missing, unfortunately I have no idea why they have not been recorded.
""Expenses and use of the purchase card were properly scrutinised by officers and our audit staff. No such issue was raised with me,"" he said.
Council spokesman Mark Wynn said: ""Councillor Jones, in his role as leader, met with potential external investors with a view to attracting regeneration and development to the borough.
""The council has reviewed all the transactions brought to its attention and responded accordingly and is conducting its own internal review.""
Cheshire Police received a complaint from a former Cheshire West & Chester councillor in February.
It said: ""The allegation is currently being reviewed, in order to establish whether any offences may have been committed.""",A former council leader's expenses are being reviewed over claims they may have breached the authority's rules.
"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:52 EST, 28 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:53 EST, 28 May 2013 . A Utah woman gave birth to a healthy set of quintuplets over the weekend with help from a team of eight doctors, one anesthesiologist and dozens of nurses ensuring the mother and the tiny babies survived. Guillermina and Fernando Garcia's five babies – three girls and two boys – weigh between 2 to 3 pounds each and are expected to have to stay at the University of Utah hospital in Salt Lake City for another six weeks. Doctors predict they will grow up completely healthy. Joy: Guillermina, left, and her husband Fernando Garcia welcomed quintuplets, 3 girls and 2 boys over the weekend in Salt Lake City . New addition: The Utah mother welcomed 3 girls and 2 boys over the weekend (the hospital didn't identify the newborns in the photos they released) Bundle of joy: The Garcia family welcomed three girls among the set of quintuplets, they were named Esmeralda, Fatima, Marissa (one of the unidentified girls born over the weekend) Tiny: The newborns were born by cesarean section. They weigh between 2 to 3 pounds each (pictured one of the unidentified newborns) Guillermina Garcia, 34, carried the babies until 31 1/2 weeks – seven weeks shorter than most single-birth pregnancies but about three weeks longer than most quintuplet mothers. The extra time in the womb helped their lungs develop more than other quintuplets, said Dr. Elizabeth O'Brien, of the newborn intensive care unit. 'They are all doing remarkably well,' O'Brien said. It was the first set of quintuplets ever born at the hospital. Less than 10 quintuplet sets are born each year in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention counted 37 babies who were born as part of a set of five or more in 2010. 'We feel like we're dreaming,' said Fernando Garcia in Spanish at a Monday afternoon news conference. 'It's incredible that we have five.' Early days: The 2 boys are still using breathing tubes, as the girls are breathing on their own. The infants are expected to have to stay at the hospital for another six weeks (pictured one of the unidentified newborns) Precious: The Utah couple used fertility drugs, which increases the odds of a woman having multiple births (pictured an unidentified newborn from the quintuplets born) The Utah couple used fertility drugs, which increases the odds of a woman having multiple births. They found out early in the pregnancy they were having quintuplets, and Guillermina Garcia had been in the hospital on bed rest since early April. All five babies were born by cesarean section – coming out within two minutes. A team of five, including one doctor and two nurses, was waiting for each baby. Their names are Esmeralda, Fatima, Marissa, Fernando and Jordan. 'I was excited to see them and see that they were ok, that everything turned out normally,' she said in Spanish. The largest is baby Fernando, who weighed 3 pounds, 14 ounces. The two baby boys are still using breathing tubes, while the girls are breathing on their own. Dr. Tracy Manuck served as Guillermina Garcia's doctor at the hospital and called the mother an extraordinary person who never complained, despite suffering from high blood pressure and severe pre-eclampsia during the pregnancy. The doctors also complimented her husband's support throughout the pregnancy – including in the operating room Sunday morning.

'He did not become a patient, which is a good thing,' Manuck said. Though the hospital had never had quintuplets before, they've had many women give birth to triplets and quadruplets and drew on those experiences to help them Sunday, Manuck said. The beaming couple, originally from Guanajuato, Mexico, now begins a future sure to be filled with droves of dirty diapers, endless hours of trying to calm crying babies and enough bottles and binkies to fill a sink. They also have a 1-year-old girl, Julietta. They said they have sisters who live in the area who will help them. Fernando Garcia's bosses have told him to take as much time off as he needs from his work as a welder at a local factory. The family has health insurance, but the Utah Doula Association has setup an account where people can donate to help with the costs of having five babies. When asked how she plans to care for all five babies, Guillermina Garcia shrugged her shoulders, laughed and said simply: 'I don't know.' Her husband smiled and gave a more confident answer: 'Now that they're here, we'll find a way,' he said. 'We're through the hardest part.'","Newborns weigh between 2 to 3 pounds each .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Introducing a new word: ""cultuphobia."" It means the fear that another person's culture is taking over your own. The word may be new, but the concept is ancient. America is a land of immigrants that has, in truth, never liked immigrants -- no matter where they came from and whether they came with the proper documents or a letter of reference from the Queen of England. Part of the reason that we don't like immigrants is because they frighten us. And one way in which they frighten us is because we worry that -- with the changes they bring -- they'll wind up marginalizing us and making us less important and less relevant. There is a name for that fear: cultuphobia. For an example, look at what happened this week to mark the launch of the new English-language, Latino-targeted television network Fusion, founded by ABC and Univision. The parent companies came up with what they thought was the cute idea of swapping anchors on their top-rated morning shows. The Spanish-language show, ""Despierta America,"" which is based in Miami, sent hosts Raul Gonzalez and Karla Martinez to New York for some early morning chitchat with George Stephanopoulos and Robin Roberts, the hosts of ""Good Morning America."" Meanwhile, GMA sent Lara Spencer and Sam Champion to Miami to visit with the ""Despierta America"" crew. Come to think of it, this was a pretty good idea. And no one seemed to enjoy it more than the hosts who switched places. In New York, Gonzalez and Martinez were on the ""Good Morning America"" set on the same day as Enrique Iglesias, who sang a new song. Everyone seemed comfortable with one another, and there was a lot of laughing and dancing. In Miami, Spencer told The Huffington Post that she ""had no idea how much fun it was"" to be on Spanish-language television and implored producers to ""please have me back."" Champion proclaimed that he loved the experience and didn't want to go back to New York. ""I'm staying,"" he told the website. More laughing and dancing, this time to mariachi music. It is no wonder that it all went so well, proclaimed Mexican actor Eugenio Derbez, who was also a guest on ""Despierta America"" that day. His hit movie ""Instructions Not Included"" is in limited release in the United States. After all, these days, the language barrier is just a puddle jump and, he said, among Latinos in the U.S., ""everyone speaks both English and Spanish."" Here is where the story gets interesting. Judging from the reaction on the ""Good Morning America"" page on Facebook and the comment section following news stories about the switch, many regular viewers of ""Good Morning America"" did not appreciate the gimmick. In fact, many of them were furious. Some said they changed the channel. Others vowed to never watch the show again if there is a repeat performance. ""This had better be a one-time thing,"" wrote one disgruntled viewer. One woman complained that, when she tunes in to her favorite morning news show, she expects to get what she always gets -- the news of the day ""in ENGLISH."" There's the giveaway. For many of those angry ""Good Morning America"" viewers, it might just have been a case of them preferring to stick with what they like. But for others, it was a case of cultuphobia. These viewers aren't just protecting their favorite show, but -- as they probably see it -- their language, culture and civilization. This is the other side to cultural marketing, and it's ugly. A corporation -- or in this case, a media company such as ABC -- might vie for a larger market share by going after a new set of viewers and alienate its core audience members, who feel slighted, ignored or insulted. When that happens, the core isn't quiet. The core speaks up. Maybe next time, the company decides it isn't worth it. I hope that doesn't happen here. I hope ABC will stand its ground and continue down this road of trying to reach Latino viewers. Still, I'm not sure how Fusion will perform in the long run. I have concerns, and I'm not alone. While the new network is marketed to younger viewers who speak English, it doesn't seem that they've thought deeply about how to reach their viewers. That's not an easy demographic group to tap into, for either marketers or media. Plus, Fusion would be better off not becoming simply an English-language, hipper version of Univision, where -- as I would put it -- the anchors are white and the politics are blue. The liberal Spanish-language network is all about advocacy journalism and protecting what it sees as the interests of Latino immigrants -- especially the undocumented. Yet, on most of its telenovelas, which are produced in Mexico, the lead actress is European-looking with light skin. So, at Univision, they seem to believe that dark-skinned immigrants should have the full pallet of rights -- except, apparently, the right to appear in a starring role on Spanish-language television. That's evidence of a different kind of phobia, and a depressing reminder that -- in either language, and either of side of the border -- people are the same, and prejudice is alive and well.

"The inquests focused on the final movements of Tony Bland, who was left severely brain damaged by the 1989 crush but lived until 1993.
He was left in a persistent vegetative state but his life supporting treatment was removed after a legal battle.
Mr Bland was 18 at the time of the disaster but died aged 22.
The court heard the teenager, from Keighley, West Yorkshire, attended the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989 with a friend, Allan Gill.
They entered the Sheffield stadium at about 14:25 BST and made their way to a central terrace enclosure known as pen three at the Leppings Lane end.
Mr Gill said the crowd ""seemed to really tighten up"" when the players came onto the pitch.
He said he heard screams and shouts from people saying they could not breathe and needed to get out of the pen.
In evidence read to the court, he said he did not see Mr Bland from that point on and that he eventually fell forward and was pulled through a gate.
Footage showed Mr Bland, wearing a red and white Liverpool hat, being lifted over a fence into pen two and then being carried onto the pitch by two police officers at about 15:23 - more than 15 minutes after the match was halted.
PC Steven Plows and a doctor, Colin Flenley, who was at the ground as a fan, said they thought Mr Bland had no pulse and was not breathing when they first attended him.
They eventually detected a heartbeat at 15:26 after several rounds of heart compressions and Mr Bland was put into the back of a St John Ambulance seven minutes later.
The jury heard there were already three casualties inside, with one unconscious adult on the floor, and that Mr Bland was placed on top of him.
PC Paul Jenkinson told the court that he performed mouth-to-mouth on Mr Bland en route to Sheffield's Northern General Hospital and that the casualty began breathing as they arrived.
He said: ""I am fairly sure it was before he went on the trolley because I seem to have got this feeling of relief that we pulled into the hospital and... he was going to get some proper medical attention.""
Rani Naidoo, a senior house officer at the Northern General's gynaecology department at the time, went to assist in A&E after she heard ""a number of sirens and ambulances coming up the hill"".
She said she attended Mr Bland ""because there was no other medical or nursing staff with him"".
Dr Naidoo said she had not been told that a crush had taken place at Hillsborough and recalled an unidentified person telling her they thought a stand had collapsed.
Hospital notes recorded Mr Bland as being unconscious on arrival and ""unresponsive to painful stimuli"".
Breathing was spontaneous but ""laboured"", it was added.
She said she judged him ""stable"" following her initial assessment and thought he did not require any further intervention at that point as his observations were ""reasonable and satisfactory"".
Christina Lambert QC, counsel for the coroner, asked her: ""Did you believe that there was any need for steps to be taken to either secure Tony's airway or indeed to provide him with assisted ventilation?""
She replied: ""I believe at that time my assessment was that his condition was stable. He was breathing by himself spontaneously.""
The jury was told that Mr Bland was first transferred to a general ward for ongoing care at the Northern General, rather than the intensive care unit (ICU).
Asked if she was concerned that he was not transferred to ICU, Dr Naidoo said: ""Well, it was a very extraordinary day.
""I was aware there were a significant number of extremely ill casualties in the A&E department, all receiving varying levels of care.""
Mr Bland was later intubated and ventilated on the receiving ward by other clinicians before his condition deteriorated and he was eventually taken to the cardiac ICU.
At about 18:00 it was noted that ventilation was ""becoming harder"" and emergency intervention was needed, the court was told.
The hearing was adjourned until Monday.

Mr Trump, who has highlighted veterans' issues during his campaign, called their support ""a great honour"".
He has meanwhile been dismissing claims of impropriety over a political donation to a Florida official.
The Washington Post reported on Monday that in 2013 Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi had been considering fraud charges against Trump University.
But she dropped the investigation after a $25,000 (Â£18,600) contribution to her political campaign from the Donald J Trump Foundation.
Mr Trump was fined because he did not disclose the contribution to the US tax authorities.
The letter released on Tuesday by his campaign was signed by four 4-star generals.
The former top brass stated they believe Mr Trump is ""more trusted to be commander-in-chief than (Democratic nominee) Hillary Clinton"".
""We believe that such a change can only be made by someone who has not been deeply involved with, and substantially responsible for, the hollowing out of our military and the burgeoning threats facing our country around the world,"" they added.
Both Mr Trump and Mrs Clinton will take part back-to-back in a national security forum on Wednesday.
The forum, to be hosted by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, will include questions from an audience of military service members.
Also on Tuesday, Mrs Clinton released a campaign ad featuring veterans who are critical of Mr Trump.

 NEW ORLEANS — All last week, people were calling Louis Charbonnet to find out how they might avoid lying down at their funerals. Funeral directors have called; so have people with their own requests, such as the woman who wanted to be seen for the last time standing over her cooking pot. 
  
 The calls started coming in to the Charbonnet-Labat Funeral Home during its June 12 viewing for Miriam Burbank, who died at 53 and spent her service sitting at a table amid miniature New Orleans Saints helmets, with a can of Busch beer at one hand and a menthol cigarette between her fingers, just as she had spent a good number of her living days. 
  
 Word of the arrangement began to spread, hundreds showed up, the news spread online, and now here was Mr. Charbonnet getting a call from a funeral director in Australia. 
  
 Ms. Burbank’s service was the second of its kind that Mr. Charbonnet had arranged, and the third in New Orleans in two years. But there have been others elsewhere, most notably in San Juan, P.R. Viewings there in recent years have included a paramedic displayed behind the wheel of his ambulance and, in 2011, a man dressed for his wake like Che Guevara, cigar in hand and seated Indian style.

 “I never said it was the first,” said Mr. Charbonnet, who mentioned the 1984 funeral of Willie Stokes Jr., a Chicago gambler known as the Wimp, who sat through his funeral services behind the wheel of a coffin made to look like a Cadillac Seville. 
  
 New Orleans, which has long boasted of its ability to put the “fun” in funeral, seems like the place where this kind of thing would catch on, and Mr. Charbonnet boasts that his 132-year-old funeral home is well known for its funeral parades. 
  
 “Couple weeks ago we even had a mariachi band in here,” he said, while checking text messages from people he referred to almost gleefully as his “haters” — apparently other funeral directors. They were criticizing such viewings as improper or even sacrilegious, a concern Mr. Charbonnet admitted was shared by his wife. But he said that he had gotten the O.K. from a local priest and that, besides, he was honoring family wishes.

 The phenomenon first appeared in Puerto Rico in 2008, four years before the first such funeral in New Orleans, with a 24-year-old murder victim whose viewing took place in his family’s living room, the body tethered against a wall. Angel Luis Pantojas’s funeral — called “muerto parao,” dead man standing — became an instant sensation. 
  
 Another murder victim, on a motorcycle, followed, along with the paramedic and the man dressed like Guevara. This year, a boxer’s body was arranged standing in a ring, and an elderly woman was propped up in her rocking chair. 
  
 The same funeral director, of the Marín Funeral Home in San Juan, arranged all of these.

 “It’s been a real boom in Puerto Rico,” said Elsie Rodríguez, vice president of the funeral home. “People have requested every type of funeral that could possibly come to mind. We have only done six so far, because the people who have requested the funerals have not died yet.”

 Ms. Rodríguez said the idea had come from Mr. Pantojas himself. His family has said that ever since he attended his father’s funeral at age 6, Mr. Pantojas had told relatives that he wanted to be viewed on his feet. 
  
 “This is not a fun or funny event; the family is going through a lot of pain,” Ms. Rodríguez said. With these kinds of arrangements, “the family literally suffers less, because they see their loved one in a way that would have made them happy — they see them in a way in which they still look alive.” 
  
 At first, some in Puerto Rico were against the services — which start around $1,700 — an opposition that Ms. Rodríguez attributed to “professional jealousy.” The Puerto Rico Legislature held hearings in which the Department of Health and other funeral directors weighed in. 
  
 “I thought it would propagate competitions for the most exotic funeral,” said Jorge Lugo, president of the Puerto Rico Funeral Home Association. “These people — not all of them, but some of these people who had these funerals — belonged to the underworld and had a life of fast money. It seemed to me that with these kinds of people doing this, there could be negative consequences.” 
  
 As it happened, Mr. Lugo said, the only other time a funeral home tried something unusual — the wake of a dog — it was a fiasco, as the dog had not been embalmed. A law passed in 2012 officially made the wakes with posed cadavers legal, “as long as the position is not immoral,” Mr. Lugo said.

 Such funerals are still quite rare in the United States, though not unheard-of: This year, a deceased biker in Mechanicsburg, Ohio, was towed to a cemetery in a homemade plexiglass coffin, his body astride his Harley-Davidson motorcycle. There, in accordance with his longstanding request, he was buried, motorcycle and all. 
  
 The services began in New Orleans in 2012 with the death of Lionel Batiste, a brass band leader and dapper man about town. Mr. Batiste had said he did not want to have people looking down at him at his funeral, so at his service, here at Mr. Charbonnet’s funeral home, Mr. Batiste stood with his hands on his walking cane, derby tipped rakishly to one side. 
  
 Then in April of this year, there was the service for Mickey Easterling, a socialite and proficient party hostess. 
  
 “What my mother said to me some years ago was, ‘I want to be at my own funeral having a glass of Champagne in one hand and a cigarette in the other,’ ” said Ms. Easterling’s daughter, Nanci. And so she was, greeting her funeral guests from an elegant bench in the lobby of a historic downtown theater. 
  
 Then this month, Zymora Kimball came to the Charbonnet funeral home to ask about arrangements for Ms. Burbank, who had raised Ms. Kimball like a daughter. Ms. Burbank had been neither wealthy nor widely known outside the neighborhood over which she presided from a table on her front porch. 
  
 Ms. Kimball wanted something “out of the box,” said Lyelle Bellard, the intern funeral director, and when he suggested his plan, she thought it brilliantly captured Ms. Burbank’s style. Mr. Bellard said it did not end up costing much more than a typical funeral. 
  
 Despite the recent interest, organizations representing funeral home directors say this kind of viewing is still rare, and just about everyone, including Ms. Kimball, acknowledges that it is not for everyone. 
  
 Even Ms. Rodríguez in San Juan said she has had to refuse a few suggestions that she found distasteful or that “made no sense.” She will not, for example, do a wake with someone in a swimsuit, she said. ||||| This party's dead! Daughters throw bizarre 'party funeral' for mother including her own body propped up at a table under a disco ball with a cigarette and whiskey in hand 
  
 Miriam Burbank died on June 1 at 53 years old 
  
 Her daughters wanted her funeral to reflect how full of life she was 
  
 The decided on propping their mother's body up at a table stocked with cigarettes and booze 
  
 This is the second New Orleans funeral this year that included the body of the deceased seated with booze and cigarettes 
  
 A New Orleans woman was laid to rest earlier this month - but only after one final party, during which her body was displayed sitting at a table that is fully stocked with beer, whiskey and menthol cigarettes. 
  
 But no party is complete without a flashing disco ball, and 53-year-old Miriam Burbank's funeral service was complete with one of those, as well. 
  
  
  
 Burbank died on June 1. When the funeral home directors at Charbonnet Funeral Home asked Burbank's two daughters what their mother liked, the two women decided they wanted her funeral to reflect that she was full of life.

 'Full of life': Miriam Burbank's daughters wanted their mother's funeral be representative of how full of life she was - and this is what they came up with 
  
 Party animal: Burbank's funeral was complete with her dead body propped up at a table with a case of beer and a bottle of whiskey 
  
 Menthols: Burbank's daughters also included a pack of menthol cigarettes 
  
 So the daughters came up with the interesting concept of having their mother's body displayed as though she were at a party - where, presumably, she sat and smoked menthol cigarettes while drinking beer and whiskey as a disco ball lit up the room. 
  
 To honor Burbank's love of the New Orleans Saints football team, her fingernails were painted black and gold - the color of the team's uniforms. 
  
  
  
 According to WGNO, Burbank's daughters said that other family members liked the idea, and thought it was a very fitting goodbye for their mother. 
  
  
  
 This is the second time this year when New Orleans has played host to a rather taboo funeral service. 
  
  
  
 In April, well-known New Orleans philanthropist Mickey Easterling was sent off in a similar fashion. 
  
 Trend: In April, New Orleans socialite Mickey Easterling had a similar funeral service 
  
 Smokers: Like Burbank, Easterling's funeral service included a cigarette and alcohol 
  
 Planned: Unlike Burbank, Easterling planned her entire funeral service, from the champagne to the elaborate hat 
  
 More than a thousand people attended the popular, 83-year-old socialite's funeral - at which her body was propped up on an iron bench with a glass of champagne in one hand and a cigarette holder in the other. 
  
 'She`s in a Leonardo outfit,' Sammy Steele, who did Mickey’s hair and make-up, told WGNO at the time. 'And I actually dressed her tonight for the occasion.' 
  
 Easterling was known for being a bit on the fabulous side, so for her funeral she also was wearing and ornate hate and a fancy outfit. 
  
  |||||","– A boxer wore his gloves and stood in the corner of the ring, apparently ready for a fight—except for the fact that he was deceased. The scene was the funeral of Christopher Rivera, a former fighter whose memorial service belongs to a relatively new trend: Bodies are posed the way they might have been seen in life. Others featured a man riding a motorcycle and a woman sitting in a chair. ""It’s been a real boom in Puerto Rico,” says an exec at the funeral home that organized the events. “People have requested every type of funeral that could possibly come to mind."" It began with a man who stood at his funeral; he'd always wanted it that way, family said. And the phenomenon is no longer limited to Puerto Rico. It's been happening in New Orleans, too, where this month a deceased woman sat at a table with a cigarette and a beer during her funeral, the New York Times reports. Her family saw the event as a party, disco ball included, the Daily Mail notes. Unsurprisingly, some have raised objections to the trend. But Puerto Rico has passed a law legalizing the process, and Louis Charbonnet, a New Orleans funeral home head, says a priest has OKed it."

Mr Saatchi’s art company Conarco, and left it waiting for an age . outside the family home. Irritated . by its beeping, 70-year-old Mr Saatchi made enquiries. He was shocked . to discover it had been waiting to take one of his personal assistants . to a polo match in Berkshire. Mr . Saatchi’s finance director at Conarco, Rahul Gajjar, told the court . that although he had noted Francesca Grillo’s credit card spending . creeping up – with her monthly limit leaping from £25,000 to £100,000 – . he had not yet thought to raise the matter. Only . when the taxi incident happened did he investigate properly and tell Mr . Saatchi that each month Francesca was spending on average £48,000 and . Elisabetta £28,000.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:52 EST, 21 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:12 EST, 22 June 2012 . Victim in the family: Matt Sandusky was preparing to testify against his adopted father during the child sex abuse trial . Jerry Sandusky's own adopted son has dramatically accused him of abuse as a jury deliberates over scores of sex abuse charges against the former Penn State coach. A lawyer for Matt Sandusky said the man told authorities that the former Penn State assistant football coach abused him. Matt Sandusky is one of Jerry Sandusky's six adopted children. His lawyers, Andrew Shubin and Justine Andronici, issued a statement on Thursday naming Matt Sandusky and saying that the 33-year-old had been prepared to testify on behalf of prosecutors at his father's sex abuse trial. The statement says Matt Sandusky is 'a victim of Jerry Sandusky's abuse,' but doesn't go into specifics. NBC News reported that Matt Sandusky was to take the stand as a 'rebuttal witness' if Jerry Sandusky testified. Jerry Sandusky's defence team ultimately decided the 68-year-old former coach wouldn't speak in his own defence . Matt Sandusky's attorney's told the network: 'This has been an extremely painful experience for Matt and he has asked us to convey his request that the media respect his privacy,' they said. The statement came after jurors began deliberating 48 charges against the ex-coach. Prosecutors say Sandusky met the 10 sex-abuse victims through his charity, The Second Mile, which he established in 1977. Lawyers for Matt and Jerry Sandusky and . prosecutors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Matt . Sandusky's lawyer says his client met with investigators very recently. Scroll down for video . New allegation: One of Jerry Sandusky's six adopted sons, Matt, has come forward through an attorney, saying that the ex-coach abused him too . Spouse: Jerry Sandusky and his wife Dottie, pictured Thursday outside the courthouse, were married in 1966, and have no biological children, but they adopted six times . Matt Sandusky went to live with Sandusky and his wife, Dottie, as a foster child and was adopted by them as an adult. Shortly after Sandusky's arrest in November, Matt Sandusky's ex-wife Jill Jones successfully obtained a restraining order forbidding the children from sleeping at their grandparents' home. At about the same time, details emerged that Matt Sandusky had attempted suicide just four months after first going to live with Jerry and Dottie Sandusky in 1995. He had come into the home through The Second Mile charity, and was first a foster child before being legally adopted. His name also came up last week during the testimony of one of Sandusky's 10 accusers. The man, dubbed Victim 4 by prosecutors, said Matt Sandusky was living at the Sandusky home on an occasion when he had stayed there overnight. When asked by prosecutors whether Jerry Sandusky ever engaged him in a soap battle in the showers, he recounted a time when he and Matt Sandusky had been playing racket ball. When they were done, he said, they went back to a locker room. Matt got undressed and got into the shower and then Victim 4 and Sandusky followed him in there, he testified. 'Me and Jerry came in. He started pumping his hand full of soap,' he said. At that point, Matt shut off his shower and left and went to another locker room to shower, the witness said. Asked by prosecutors about Matt's facial expression when the soap battles started, he replied: 'Nervous.' Jerry and Dottie Sandusky married in 1966 and have no biological children together, but adopted six times and have served as foster parents. The news comes just hours after a 30-year-old Ohio man became the first alleged Sandusky victim to reveal himself to the public, saying in an interview that he was sexually abused by Jerry Sandusky more than 100 times, starting when he was just ten. Travis Weaver said Sandusky preyed on . him after he and his brother went to a summer camp for the Second Mile, a . charity the coach founded and through which he is accused of cultivating . most of his victims. In the jurors' hands: Sandusky is pictured leaving court on Thursday after closing arguments in his child sex abuse trial . Coming forward: Travis Weaver is the first alleged victim of Jerry Sandusky to go public with his story of abuse at the hands of the Penn State coach . The revelation comes on the same day as a jury begins to deliberate Mr Sandusky's fate on 48 counts of sexual abuse charges. In closing arguments, his attorney said the accusers were liars who were hoping to cash in on legal settlements from the university. Mr Weaver is not one of the eight accusers who testified at trial, but he did tell his story to the grand jury that handed down the Sandusky's indictment, NBC News reported. An exclusive interview with Mr Weaver will air at 10pm Thursday on Rock Center. When asked what he would do if he ever met Sandusky again, Mr Weaver doesn't hesitate. Silence: For 15 years, Mr Weaver says, he thought he was Sandusky's only victim. That all changed last fall when the former coach was indicted on charges he abused other eight boys . 'I'd punch him in his mouth,' he said. 'There would be no reason to say anything. He knows what he did.' During the sex abuse trial, Sandusky's . lawyer Joe Amendola said the former coach is being railroaded by . overzealous investigators and prosecutors. He strenuously denied that . accusations and Sandusky has maintained his innocence since his arrest . last fall. Jurors in Jerry Sandusky's child sexual abuse case began deliberations on Thursday after his lawyer and a state prosecutor made closing arguments that followed seven days of testimony. The former Penn State University coach's attorney claimed all eight of Jerry Sandusky's accusers are lying about their sex abuse allegations in the hopes of winning big settlements from the college. Joe Amendola quoted Mother Theresa as he said his client had been railroaded by overzealous investigators and greedy witnesses. He told the jury that prosecutors' case 'doesn't make sense. Sandusky is accused of molesting eight boys over the course of 15 years in a case that shocked the nation and led to the firing of Joe Paterno, one of the most respected head coaches in college football history. When Amendola cited Sandusky's decades of charity work, he referred to the Mother Theresa  'Anyway.' It includes the line: 'If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives; Be kind anyway.' Amendola laid the blame for the allegations at the feet of state police investigators who he said coached the alleged victims into giving accusatory statements. Amendola . said the accusers were greedy an they lied about the abuse in the hopes . of winning big payouts from Penn State University so they could drive . new cars and buy big houses. Mr Weaver has also filed a lawsuit and is being represented by a well-known attorney who has specialized in sex abuse cases against the Catholic church. The abuse began in 1992, Mr Weaver told NBC's Rock Center, when he met Sandusky at a swimming pool at a camp sponsored by the Second Miles, which Sandusky founded to help at-risk young boys. 'It was like meeting my hero,' Mr Weaver said of Sandusky, who was once the top pick to replace legendary Penn State football coach Joe Paterno. The individual attention Sandusky gave Mr Weaver began innocently, but gradually grew more and more sinister, he said. It began with a shower in the Penn State football team's locker room. 'After the shower was over... he'd dry me off with a towel. He'd say he was trying to wrestle with me... and then it progressed into oral sex,' Mr Weaver told NBC. He always assumed he was the only victim, he said. He never imagined there have been other boys until Sandusky was arrested last fall. Mr Weaver also blasted Sandusky's wife, Dottie, who testified that she never saw or heard anything that would have made her think her husband was molesting boys. He recalled on incident when Sandusky performed oral sex on him in a bedroom across the hall from Mrs Sandusky. 'How could she not know?' Mr Weaver said. He man said the abuse continued for four years until he moved away to Ohio to flee Sandusky. Watch video here . Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy .

It seems like the ultimate lazy girl's fantasy - or the plot of a science fiction movie. But new research has revealed sporting performance can be improved while we sleep. It comes down to lucid dreaming - essentially the sort of dream you have while fast asleep but in which you aware you are dreaming and can thus control your dream world. Studies have for some time noted a link between lucid dreaming during REM sleep and improved athletic performance, but had never isolated the reason why. Now research by Heidelberg University and published in the Guardian's running blog shows that the improvement stems from the fact that your mind believes you are practising the sport for real. Sportsmen and women who have engaged in training while they sleep have described enhanced performance after practising such things as a complex move, a tricky shot in basketball or a free kick in football over and over again. Others have controlled their dreams to make themselves run faster, or for longer without tiring, or simply told themselves they can move past feelings of exhaustion to carry on running. One ballerina in the study describes struggling with a complicated move for some time before 'sleep practising' it - and found she could then perform it in real life too. Though scientists are not yet certain of what brain activity is behind lucid dreaming, research by Muzur, Pace-Schott and Hobson has suggested that activation of the  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, usually  deactivated during REM (Rapid Eye Moment sleep) may be responsible for us regaining self-awareness while still asleep. The amygdala and parahippocampal cortex is less intensely activated than normal to allow us to maintain self-awareness and yet remain asleep. Previous research has proved that lucid dreamers are indeed asleep, but are aware that they are in a dream. Dreamers have been able to signal to researchers from within their dream using pre-agreed eye movements. In the 1980s German psychologist Paul Tholey was the first to note the link between lucid dreaming and improved performance, and in 2010 psychologists Erlacher and Schredl showed that practising a coin tossing task in lucid dreams led to an improved objective performance. It all sounds too good to be true. But becoming an accomplished lucid dreamer is not necessarily easy. If you do not naturally lucid dream it is possible to train yourself to do so. The first step is to be able to recognise that you are in a dream once asleep, which some people attempt to do by performing ‘reality checks’ in a dream. However it takes considerable training to be able to perform these within a dream. Once aware you are dreaming, the dreamer . must be cautious to let the dream continue but be conscious enough to . remember that it is a dream. Most people can train themselves to lucid dream, and the possible uses for being aware and in control of your dream world are endless . However the benefits once mastered are said to be incredible with people not only being able to change nightmares into positive dreams and problem solve while asleep, but also report having immense fun. Being able to control the dream world means people report enjoying anything from flying to making a cake as large as a house, indulging in sexual fantasies and curing nightmares. Note down your target dream. What do you want to dream about? Who will you be and what will you be doing? What is your goal in the dream? Meditate on the narrative before you go to sleep. Imagine the scenes you will appear in and what you will do. Draw pictures, use visualisation. Focus on the detail - don't be too general. Make your fantasy specific. Avoid television or books before bed or those stories and images may take over your own narrative. Recognise that you are in a dream once asleep. Some people attempt . this by performing ‘reality checks’ in a dream. Ask yourself regularly during the day - 'am I dreaming? Am I awake?'. Once habitual, this thought process can be carried over into your dream world, . Once aware you are dreaming, be cautious to let the dream continue but be conscious enough to . remember that it is a dream. Think about your dreams when you wake up - this will help you remember them and allow them to have more effect.

"Winkelman previously was unsure whether English football's third-longest serving boss would remain in place.
""I'm comfortable in saying that Karl will be the manager next season because he wants to be,"" said Winkelman.
""If he wants it and he's got that drive, ambition then he understands the club so much better that someone else.""
He continued to BBC Look East: ""He already has a promotion out of League One and he's somebody that when we make mistakes, we make them honestly and ultimately, I trust him.
Robinson, 35, was unable to keep the Dons up in their first-ever season in the Championship.
Following relegation, Robinson publically said he felt the club should have used the money received from Tottenham for midfielder Dele Alli more wisely, and Winkelman admitted mistakes had been made with recruitment.
""Everybody had to get off their chests the things they felt were wrong and that's part of the cathartic nature of sorting out problems,"" said Winkelman.
""We needed to talk. Karl needed to look me in the eye and know I would continue to invest in him and I needed to look in his eye and know that if I'm going to do that he's going to work his guts out because I think we have more pressure than we've ever had as a football club.
""In fact, I'm quite excited by the fact we've got more pressure because it means we're becoming a bigger club. I'm excited about being a big club in League One next season.""","MK Dons manager Karl Robinson will still be in charge next season despite their relegation to League One, according to chairman Pete Winkelman."
"Alan Shearer says he does not hold much hope for former club Newcastle United and fears a ‘long, hard season’ lies ahead. The Magpies are without a win this term and reside in the bottom three going into Saturday’s home game with Leicester City. Manager Alan Pardew has seen off intense speculation surrounding his future - at least in the short-term - and retains the support of owner Mike Ashley. Peter Crouch scores for Stoke in one of seven Premier League games Newcastle United have failed to win . Former Magpies striker Alan Shearer worries for his club this season, saying they 'haven't been good enough' Pardew looks unhappy as he watches his team draw 2-2 with Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium . But Shearer has not been impressed by performances on the pitch. Indeed, his hometown team have collected just 20 points from a possible 78 since the turn of the year. He told the Chronicle: ‘It has been poor since January this year,’ said the club’s record goalscorer, who netted 206 times during 10 years on Tyneside. ‘I’m exactly the same as the fans at the minute - I’m one of them. ‘I pay for my ticket and I’m the same. I am entitled to my opinion. Shearer scored a club record 206 goals in 10 years on Tyneside but fears for his former side this year . Newcastle supporters held numerous banners calling for Pardew to be sacked during the 1-0 defeat at Stoke . ‘It hasn’t been pleasant watching to be honest. ‘I don’t hold too much hope for us this season. I think it could be a long, hard season for us.’ And Shearer says there are no mitigating circumstances for Pardew or the club to put forward as an excuse for results, admitting there is a real danger they could be dragged in to a relegation battle. ‘Nobody can make any excuses,’ added Shearer, speaking ahead of the 206 Dinner in Newcastle next month. ‘The simple fact is we haven’t been good enough. You can make whatever excuses you want. Injuries, too many games or confidence. Newcastle fans have reacted angrily to their side's start to the campaign, calling for Pardew's head . Newcastle have been denied the services of promising midfielder Siem de Jong (centre) through injury . ‘Put all of that to one side, the simple fact of the matter is we just have not been good enough. ‘We haven’t been unlucky. We haven’t been ravaged by injuries. We haven’t been done by dodgy decisions. ‘We just haven’t been good enough. It’s simple. That’s the harsh reality of it. ‘Things have to improve and they have to improve pretty quickly or we could find ourselves in a hole. ‘The quicker we can get out of it the better.’ Shearer is greeted by thousands of Newcastle fans after signing for the club for £15million in 1996 .","Former Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer fears for his hometown club .

"By . James Rush . PUBLISHED: . 04:52 EST, 20 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:45 EST, 20 February 2013 . John Coatman has been awarded nearly £70,000 after winning an unfair dismissal case against Salford Council for being sacked after raising concerns about inaccuracies in a report about children at risk of abuse . A council worker sacked after pointing out inaccuracies in a report about children at risk of abuse has been awarded £67,995 in an unfair dismissal case. John Coatman, 59, received the payout after a battle with Salford Council, which started in 2008. He says the case caused him so much stress he suffered a stroke. But Mr Coatman, from Salford, has now said it felt 'fantastic' to know he had won 'after years of hell'. He said: 'Even though the tribunal was a success I still wasn't sure I'd get the pay-out I felt I deserved, so this is very important to me. 'I would have taken £50,000 three years earlier if they had offered it, but this has caused me years of stress.' Mr Coatman won his case after an employment tribunal, which began in September 2011. It heard that he emailed a top Salford council director in 2008 over concerns that figures in his line manager's report on the safety of children at risk of abuse were inaccurate. The council's children's services department was under pressure at the time because it was deemed 'inadequate' by government inspectors. Mr Coatman, a statutory returns analyst, says he raised concerns but they were dismissed and his manager asked him to lie about the figures - which his manager denied before the tribunal. But the tribunal heard Mr Coatman was 'disgusted' and sent an email raising his concerns to Jill Baker - then director of the department. He also sent the email to Ofsted, the Audit Commission and Government Office North West. The figures were eventually rectified, but Mr Coatman alleged that after sending the emails he was threatened with disciplinary action, subjected to intimidating behaviour by some staff and forced to move desks before being suspended. His managers said they suspended him for allegedly communicating with colleagues in a highly inappropriate and threatening manner and failing to follow management requests. At a disciplinary hearing, it was alleged the council's trust and confidence in Mr Coatman had broken down. He claimed the allegations were malicious and took the council to a tribunal, which ruled his dismissal was unfair. His award takes into account loss of earnings and pension over three years. Stress: Mr Coatman said the case has caused him so much stress he suffered a stroke . In 2009, Mr Coatman was admitted to Salford Royal hospital suffering from a minor stroke. He said: 'The doctors couldn't work it out because I was physically fit, I played football and worked out, but then they asked if I'd been experiencing stress, and of course I had. It has been very, very difficult.' Mr Coatman has since found a new job with a management consultancy firm. He said: 'I am enjoying being in work again and even more so because my colleagues are great to work with.' Councillor John Merry, who oversees children's services, said: 'We are in a different place now to when Mr Coatman was employed at the council and action has been taken to improve the service. Ofsted has recently lifted the improvement notice and congratulated officers for the good progress made in the last two years.' Inaccuracies: Mr Coatman says he raised concerns but they were dismissed, and his manager asked him to lie about the figures - which his manager denied.

"Couldn't stay away: Michael Bloomberg will return to lead the company he founded in 1981 . Michael Bloomberg . will return as head of Bloomberg LP after the outgoing president became frustrated with the former mayor's increasing presence at the office, according to a report. Bloomberg will replace Daniel Doctoroff, the company said Wednesday, despite the widely held expectation that he intended to dedicate his life to philanthropy after leaving office just months ago. The life of leisure, it seems, is not for Bloomberg. The New York Times reports that Bloomberg has become an 'increasing presence' at the office, leaving Doctoroff 'frustrated with how the leadership dynamic had shifted.' The privately held company, in which Bloomberg is the . majority shareholder, said Doctoroff would step aside as . president and chief executive at year-end. Bloomberg, whose fortune is estimated at more than $32 . billion, had expected to spend much of his time on philanthropic . efforts after leaving office in late 2013. Those efforts have . included fights for public health and gun control. 'This is a sad day for me and my company,' Bloomberg said in . a statement. 'I really wanted Dan to stay and continue in his . leadership role. But I understand his decision.' Bloomberg, who stepped down as New York mayor last December, . added he 'never intended to come back to Bloomberg LP' after 12 . years as New York's mayor. However, the Times reports that the initial 'few hours a day' he said he'd spend at Bloomberg's Manhattan offices soon turned into six and seven hours everyday in which he'd play an increasing role in decision making. Doctoroff told Bloomberg his intention to step down two weeks ago and refused his billionaire boss's invitation to stay. Still pals: Though Bloomberg's right-hand man Daniel Doctoroff is stepping down over frustrations with the power shift since the former mayor left office, the two remain friends. Here, they participate in the ice bucket challenge . Moving on: Doctoroff stressed he was not leaving for anotheropportunity, but would focus more of his time on non-profitactivities. He also accepted Bloomberg's invitation to join theboard of the Bloomberg Philanthropies . 'So why have I decided to leave now?,' Doctoroff said in thememo. 'Simply put, while Mike never intended to come back fulltime, after he left City Hall and started to get to know thecompany again, he rediscovered what an exciting and incredibleplace this is. So he naturally wanted to be more involved.' Doctoroff became Bloomberg LP president in 2008 and CEO in . July 2011. During that period, the company's revenues increased . from $5.4 billion to more than $9 billion, he said in a memo to . the company's employees. Doctoroff, 56, a former New York deputy mayor, told the New . York Times that he informed Bloomberg two weeks ago that he . intended to resign. Bloomberg encouraged him to stay. 'This wasn't the plan,' Bloomberg told the Times. 'It was . his idea. If it was up to me, he would have stayed.' Bloomberg started the company in 1981, using a $10 million . severance package he received after he was laid off after . investment bank Salomon Brothers had been acquired. He had . headed equity trading at Salomon. During Doctoroff's tenure at the company, the numbers of . subscriptions for its terminals have grown from 273,000 to . 321,000, the company said in a statement. The company expanded . from providing financial information to markets for legal, . government and alternative energy information. Doctoroff stressed he was not leaving for another . opportunity, but would focus more of his time on non-profit . activities.

"It is a problem parents face every year - how to get the kids to bed early on New Year's Eve. Many have tried changing clocks, throwing fake parties and even tuning in to TV stations on the other side of the world. However, Netflix now has a hi-tech solution- an on demand New Year's Eve show for kids that can be played at any time. Scroll down for video . Revellers wave during the New Year's Eve celebrations in Hong Kong's Times Square: Now parents can celebrate with their kids at any time thanks to an on demand show. Netflix boasts over 53 million members in nearly 50 countries . Offers more than two billion hours of TV shows and movies . User spend 1 billion hours a month on service . Planning 20 original series in 2015 . Founded in 1997 as DVD service . More than a third of U.S. parents (34%) admitted to starting the party early to fool their kids into thinking it’s midnight, citing their kid’s or their own bedtime as the reason, a recent survey from Wakefield Research on behalf of Netflix. 22% would go as far as to stage a countdown of their own, the team found. To make the problem easier, Netflix commissioned a special show starring King Julien, star of DreamWorks Animation’s All Hail King Julien. The animated lemur will host his very own kid-sized countdown “special” on Netflix that families can use to ring in 2015 whenever they choose to celebrate. The three minutes of high-energy, music-filled fun that lets kids celebrate the New Year no matter the time of day. The countdown will be available in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, UK, Ireland, the Nordics, the Netherlands and France beginning on Dec. 29th at Netflix.com/KingJulien. Netflix boasts over 53 million members in nearly 50 countries, and offers more than two billion hours of TV shows and movies per month, including original series. Earlier this month, the company announced it hopes to have up to 20 original series running alongside its other shows and movies. The announcement was made by chief content officer Theodore Sarandos in a conference in New York. He was reported as saying, by Seeking Alpha, that Netflix wants to expand its original programming to ‘as many as 20 original series’. This is apparently a move to try and replicate the success of channels such as HBO. Mr Sarandos said the idea was to launch an ‘original season of content every two and a half weeks’ to get into a ‘regular drumbeat with consumer expectation.’ King Julien, star of DreamWorks Animation’s All Hail King Julien, who will host the special show on Netflix . Netflix is also planning to release more original movies, which include a sequel to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon next year - subtitled ‘The Green Destiny’. The move follows news earlier in the year that Yahoo is also making its own original TV shows. The first of these will be comedies titled Other Space and Sin City Saints, and they will be shown on the Yahoo website, mobile app, Apple TV and Roku devices. The series, which launch in 2016, will be available free to be viewers. And beginning in the summer of 2015, Yahoo is also planning to stream one live concert every day through a partnership with Live Nation. The expansion makes Yahoo one of the latest technology companies to mount a challenge to Netflix.

"The FSB intelligence agency said two attempted incursions had taken place over the weekend and a Russian soldier and an FSB employee had been killed.
President Vladimir Putin vowed ""further security measures"" in response to Ukraine's ""stupid and criminal"" acts.
Ukraine's president described the accusations as ""preposterous"".
""Russian accusations against Ukraine of terrorism in occupied Crimea sound as preposterous and cynical as the statements of the Russian leadership about the absence of Russian troops in the Donbass [region of rebel-held eastern Ukraine],"" Petro Poroshenko said.
""These fantasies are only a pretext for making more military threats against Ukraine,"" he added.
Russian intelligence also said it had smashed a Ukraine military intelligence network in Crimea and detained a number of people. They included a Ukrainian national named as Yevhen Panov, who is described by Russian sources as a Ukrainian military intelligence officer.
Russian state TV has been running pictures from the FSB, showing rucksacks packed with explosives. Ukrainian ""saboteurs"", sent by the defence ministry, were supposedly intending to use them in Crimea.
The claims of Ukrainian ""terrorism"" on the peninsula have sparked concern here that Moscow could respond with some kind of military action. The possibility has been discussed actively on social media, especially after President Putin's comment that he will not just ""pass over"" the death of two Russians.
Others suggest that the incident will be used - or was engineered, depending on your viewpoint - to scupper the complex peace process in Ukraine.
Straightaway, Mr Putin said more internationally-backed talks, due in the next few weeks, had been proved  ""pointless"".  So Russia has a reason to stall again on the Minsk peace process, maintain the unstable status quo in Ukraine and to blame Kiev for all of it.
Russia says one of those detained is Yevhen Panov. Initial reports suggest he was a former military volunteer fighting for Ukraine in the east of the country. However he has apparently more recently been associated with a charitable organisation.
Ukraine has managed to contain the Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and, in purely military terms, it is hard to see what Ukraine has to gain by provoking its larger, much more powerful neighbour. For all the talk about rapprochements and peace in eastern Ukraine, there has been very little concrete progress. Fighting between Russian-backed separatists and the Ukrainians goes on every day.
Just two weeks before Ukraine celebrates 25 years of independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, relations between Moscow and Kiev have taken another turn for the worse.
Kiev is preparing to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Ukrainian independence on 24 August, and officials have suggested Moscow may try to disrupt the celebrations.
Russia is preparing for a parliamentary election on 18 September.
The FSB said Ukrainian forces had intended to sabotage key infrastructure in Crimea.
""The aim of this subversive activity and terrorist acts was to destabilise the socio-political situation in the region ahead of preparations and the holding of elections,"" the spy agency said.
It said the attempted incursions had been accompanied by ""heavy fire"" from Ukrainian territory, resulting in the death of the Russian soldier. The FSB employee died while trying to detain infiltrators, it said.
Bombs, ammunition and mines had been found in the area where ""terrorist attacks"" had been foiled, it said.
Mr Putin said there was no point in further negotiations with Ukraine and called on the US and European countries to put pressure on Kiev to change its behaviour.
About 9,000 people are reported to have been killed in the conflict in eastern Ukraine that followed the Russian annexation of Crimea.
The annexation, which was itself largely bloodless, followed a vote to secede at a referendum on self-determination on 16 March 2014 - a ballot which was not recognised internationally.
The US and European Union imposed sanctions on Moscow in response to its seizure of the territory.",Russia has accused Ukraine of trying to carry out armed incursions into Crimea - the territory annexed by Russia in 2014 after an unrecognised referendum.
"By . Will Stewart In Moscow . Media tycoon Alexander Lebedev shovelled snow in a remote Russian village last week as part of his sentence for punching a fellow oligarch during a TV debate. The former KGB spy, owner of The Independent titles and the London Evening Standard, was ordered to clear snow at a nursery school in Maxim Gorky, close to a potato farm he owns 180 miles south of Moscow. He said he was 'enjoying' the work, which will amount to 150 hours of service. Hard at work: Owner of The Independent Alexander Lebedev cleared snow in front of a school . Punishment: The snow-shovelling follows a shift of digging and lifting to repair a playground in Maxim Gorky . Convenience: Lebedev changed his official residential address to the nearby village of Popovka, 177 miles south of Moscow, which meant he would serve his punishment close to his potato farm . The 53-year-old was spared jail despite a . conviction in July for dramatically striking billionaire Sergei . Polonsky during the 2011 television chat show. The trial was considered to be a political ‘show trial’ and linked to Lebedev’s ownership of a Russian investigative newspaper which spotlights corruption in Vladimir Putin’s government and entourage. Dressed in a designer jacket and gloves, . Lebedev, 53, cleared the first big snow of winter to allow children to . attend the school. Sentenced: Lebedev was sentenced to 150 hours of service for punching a fellow oligarch on TV . So far, the banker has learned to handle a chainsaw and fretsaw to mend playground apparatus - despite criticising his conviction and the penal system for failing to exploit his expertise. He said: ‘I object to the conviction in a legal sense so how can this be a meaningful punishment? Still, the law is the law and I show by doing what I am doing that I respect the law.’ He added: ‘It is a pity that such public works don’t use the most of what a person can do. ‘I would be glad to give some lectures, but no way, instead I must improve the environment and do something very simple that does not require even minimum qualifications.’ The penal authorities yesterday sought to . detain him in the tiny village for the duration of his sentence, but he . has demanded a move closer to Moscow, where his Siberian-born wife, . model Elena Perminova, lives with their two young children. The tycoon’s 83-year-old mother Maria, a teacher, came to check he was working properly in his exile. ‘She never praises. It was good she did not criticise me,’ he jokingly said. Mr Lebedev’s snow-clearing came as others convicted under by controversial court decisions in Russia are in limbo about their fate. Russia appeared last week to dash hopes that 26 foreigners - among 30 people seized during a Greenpeace protest in the Arctic - would be allowed to travel home for Christmas. Verdict: Lebedev, centre left with his son and co-publisher Evgeny, at the trial in Moscow earlier this year . The powerful Investigative Committee, equivalent of the FBI, is objecting allowing them exit visas to fly home pending trials for “hooliganism” in protesting at a Gazprom oil rig in the Arctic.

The four-time champion in Melbourne is making his competitive return after last playing at Wimbledon in July.
Federer beat Mischa Zverev 6-1 7-5 6-2 to set up Thursday's last-four match against fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka.
""Feeling as good as I am, playing as good as I am, that's a huge surprise to me,"" said the 35-year-old.
""If someone would have told me I'd play in the semis against Stan, never would I have called that one.
""For Stan, yes, but not for me. I honestly didn't even know a few days ago that he was in my section of the draw or I'm in his section.""
Federer, who has not won a Grand Slam title since triumphing at Wimbledon in 2012, had been sidelined by a knee injury throughout the second half of last year and has slipped from third in the world to 17th.
He played in the non-ranking Hopman Cup in Perth earlier in January, but has come through 18 sets in Melbourne.
""I think winning back-to-back matches in best-of-five sets against quality, great players has surprised me most,"" he said.
""Really that's been for me the big question mark, if I could do that so early in my comeback.
""I felt I was always going to be dangerous on any given day in a match situation. But obviously as the tournament would progress, maybe I would fade away with energy, you know, that kind of stuff.""
Federer holds an 18-3 winning record against Wawrinka, but the 31-year-old will go into the semi-final as the world number four and looking for a second consecutive Grand Slam title after last year's US Open success.
Federer has won their past two meetings, at the ATP World Tour Finals and in the US Open in 2015, but Wawrinka holds a Grand Slam win against his Davis Cup team-mate, coming in the quarter-finals of the French Open in the same year.
""Against Roger, it's always special because he's so good. He's the best player of all time,"" said the three-time Grand Slam winner.
""He has an answer for everything. But I managed to beat him in a Grand Slam, so we'll see.
""It's great to see him back at that level. Hopefully I can manage to play a great match.""
All of Wawrinka's three Grand Slam titles have come since Federer won his last five years ago.
And Wawrinka's rise to becoming a consistent top-10 player did not come until he was aged 28, and after plenty of help from his fellow Swiss.
""I remember giving Stan a lot of advice on how he should play certain guys,"" said Federer.
""Then the day came where he didn't call me so much any more. He called me less and less.
""I also felt like I didn't tell him any more, because he created his knowledge, his base, had his team. Only from time to time would I give him advice if he asked me.
""Otherwise I was happy that he was able to let go and go on his own path.""
British Davis Cup captain Leon Smith on BBC Radio 5 live
It's a great match because Wawrinka wants to stay back and bludgeon the ball with huge swings and power.
Federer's job, in the lively conditions, is to take time away from Wawrinka and not allow him to get into that rhythm. Federer has to come forward and test Wawrinka's passing shots a lot.
That's important because I don't think Stan's the best passer in the world. Roger will be able to come in a lot because Wawrinka does chip and block a lot of first-serve returns.
The way Federer is playing, even though he has missed six months of tennis, I think he's maybe the slight favourite from what I've seen.",Seventeen-time Grand Slam winner Roger Federer says he did not expect to reach the Australian Open semi-finals after a six-month injury lay-off.
"An attack by snipers on a Silicon Valley power substation last year is prompting the former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to launch a crusade to better secure and defend the nation's electrical grid. The former chairman, Jon Wellinghoff, now a San Francisco energy law attorney, called the little-publicized April 2013 attack on the substation a ""very well planned, coordinated and executed attack on a major piece of our electric grid infrastructure."" While Wellinghoff has expressed concern that the attack may have been a test run for a bigger strike -- possibly terrorism -- the FBI has declared the incident wasn't an act of terror and is still investigating the case, with no arrests made. The FBI considers the incident vandalism, said spokesman Peter Lee in San Francisco. ""There is no nexus to terrorism at this time,"" Lee said. Nonetheless, Wellinghoff is urging Congress to fill a void in federal law that he says doesn't empower any federal agency to demand better security around electrical substations, which he describes as barely protected with a chain-link fence and cameras. Even those cameras don't capture details outside the fence, because they are more focused inside it, he added. Last year's sabotage was carried out by at least one sniper at a good distance from the fence, outside the camera's focus, Wellinghoff said. ""We need to have a national coordinated plan, and we have to have a federal agency that is in charge,"" Wellinghoff said. So far, U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, has joined the call for improved security. The matter was addressed at a December hearing of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, of which Waxman is the ranking member. ""Just this April, there was an actual attack on our electricity infrastructure,"" Waxman said, referring to the Silicon Valley shooting. ""This was an unprecedented and sophisticated attack on an electric grid substation with military-style weapons. Communications were disrupted. The attack inflicted substantial damage. It took weeks to replace the damaged parts. ""The nation's critical infrastructure and defense installations simply cannot function without electricity. Yet it is clear that the electric grid is not adequately protected from physical or cyberattacks,"" Waxman said in a statement. In all, 150 rounds from an assault rifle were fired over almost 20 minutes at a Pacific Gas and Electric Company substation south of San Jose, California, knocking out 17 transformers in the post-midnight darkness of April 16, according to PG&E, Wellinghoff and CNN affiliate KTVU. To prevent a blackout to Silicon Valley, workers re-routed power, but it took almost a month to make repairs, the affiliate reported. Authorities also found an AT&T fiber optic cable was cut in an underground vault, causing a phone blackout, Sgt. Kurtis Stenderup with the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office told KTVU. By the time police arrived, the shooters, also suspected of damaging the phone line, were gone. At the time, the incident wasn't publicized, but since he stepped down as FERC chairman in November, Wellinghoff is raising public attention to the California sniper's attack to demonstrate the vulnerability of the nation's electricity system. Waxman is apparently endorsing Wellinghoff's initiative. Waxman is urging Congress to pass legislation that would ""fix this gap in regulatory authority"" and empower FERC to directly address threats to the nation's power grid. In 2010, the U.S. House passed such a measure, called the GRID Act, but the Senate didn't act on the proposal, Waxman said. The federal government relies on an energy industry organization ""to develop reliability standards for the electric grid through a protracted, consensus-based process,"" Waxman said. After the California vandalism, Arkansas also saw last year ""multiple attacks on power lines and grid infrastructure that led to millions of dollars in damage and brief power outages,"" Waxman said. PG&E officials said they have redundancies built into their electric grid ""that enable us to reroute power around damaged equipment and help keep the lights on for our customers,"" said spokesman Brian Swanson. ""Since the incident occurred, PG&E has worked aggressively with federal and local agencies to improve substation security throughout our system,"" Swanson said. ""The utility industry and stakeholders like the Edison Electric Institute are meeting with policy makers, government officials and law enforcement at all levels to engage in constructive dialogue and share information on how we can work together to protect the grid across the country."" The institute, an association of shareholder-owned electric companies, says security and protection are ""top priorities."" ""Electric companies are partnering closely with each other and with senior officials from all relevant federal and law enforcement agencies to protect the grid's most critical assets,"" said Scott Aaronson, the institute's senior director of national security policy. But he noted that ""publicizing clearly sensitive information about critical infrastructure protection endangers the safety of the American people and the integrity of the grid."" In the meantime, Wellinghoff is urging utilities to enact low-cost improvements such as replacing chain-link fencing with an opaque barrier that would block a sniper's vision of the substation. Wellinghoff is also recommending movable concrete Jersey barriers as a perimeter around the substations -- to stop any sniper bullets. He's also recommending utilities extend lighting beyond the fence yard, with more sophisticated cameras, so  video can capture saboteurs outside the fence. The California sniper or snipers were 40 to 60 yards outside the substation fence, he said. ""This isn't about this substation or this organized attack,"" Wellinghoff said of the California incident. ""This is more about the larger issue of physical security of these high-voltage substations nationwide and the need to ensure that some defensive measures start to be put in place.""","Snipers fired about 150 bullets at a power substation to Silicon Valley last year .

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 12:30 PM on 29th November 2011 . Nearly 100,000 people are living with HIV in the UK but a quarter of them are unaware that they have the disease, according to the Health Protection Agency. The latest figures show the number of sufferers has risen from 86,500 to 91,500 between 2009 and 2010. Of the 6,660 people newly diagnosed with . HIV in 2010, half came forward for testing after a time when treatment . should ideally have started. Nearly 100,000 people are living with HIV in the UK. This electron micrograph shows how HIV (orange) invades healthy immune system cells . Early treatment boosts chances of living longer with the precursor to Aids. Of the 680 people with HIV who died in 2010, two thirds had been diagnosed late. Heterosexual men were the most likely to be diagnosed late, at 63 per cent compared with 39 per cent of gay men and 58 per cent of heterosexual women. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attacks the body's immune system, which we need to fight disease and infection. The virus specifically attacks CD4 cells. Although the body will try to produce replacements, the number will eventually decline and the immune system will stop working. Once the person acquires a life-threatening condition, such as pneumonia, they are said to have the last stage of HIV - Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV is spread through bodily fluids - most commonly during unprotected sex. There is no cure but since the 1990s treatments have been developed to slow down the spread of the disease. This allows people to live with the disease for a very long time. In 2009, the World Health Organisation estimated there were 33.4m people across the globe living with HIV/AIDS. In 2010, more than 3,000 gay men were diagnosed with HIV - the highest ever annual figure. One in 20 gay men are now infected with HIV nationally, rising to one in 11 in London. Today's data also suggests that a stigma is still attached to the condition, revealing that one in five people visiting a sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic in 2010 did not accept an HIV test. The HPA is recommending that, in areas where prevalence of HIV is high, testing should be offered in places where it is not currently the norm. Testing should be offered to all people signing up with a GP and those admitted to hospital, but only with the patient's permission. Dr Valerie Delpech, consultant epidemiologist and head of HIV surveillance at the HPA, said: 'HIV is an infection which can nowadays be treated and those diagnosed promptly can expect to experience similar life expectancy as an individual without the infection. 'However, we are very concerned that a large number of people in the UK are unaware of their HIV status and are diagnosed late. 'We want to see increased access to HIV testing routinely offered in clinical settings such as new registrants at GPs and hospital general admissions, in areas of the country where rates of HIV infection are high. The cost of treating someone with HIV in the UK is estimated to be around £18,000 per year when they are not showing any symptoms. This is based on the price of care as well as triple-drug antiretroviral therapy. However, it costs £21,500 to treat patients who are showing symptoms and £41,000 for those with full-blown AIDS. Patients who have four drugs cost the NHS between £22,775 and £48,000 per year. The annual cost of providing HIV treatment and care in the UK could be as high as £758m by 2013, according to a study in PLoS One. 'We are also urging sexual health . clinics to ensure that HIV testing is offered as part of a universal . sexual health screen at every new attendance.' Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said: 'The number of people who don't know they have HIV and are diagnosed late is a serious issue. 'Not only does it have a severe impact on health and reduce life expectancy, this largely accounts for the onward transmission of HIV as people aren't taking the necessary steps to avoid passing it on.' She added: 'People shouldn't be scared of HIV testing, but they should be scared of undiagnosed HIV. 'The advances in HIV treatment have been one of the biggest success stories in the 30 years since the virus first emerged, but too many people test too late and so fail to benefit from these drugs.' Sir Nick Partridge, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'HIV rates in the UK remain dangerously high and to bring them down we all have to take responsibility for our sexual health. 'We can't just rely on partners, or chance, to keep sex safe.' The HPA has previously predicted that by 2012 there will be 100,000 people living with HIV in the UK. The study comes just ahead of World Aids Day on December 1.","One in four people with HIV don't know they have the disease .

"She was hurt when the MR-01 race car she was driving hit a support truck at Duxford airfield in Cambridgeshire on Tuesday.
It was the first time the 32-year-old Spaniard had driven the car for the Oxfordshire-based Marussia team.
Inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) visited the test track on Wednesday.
Marussia said surgeons at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge ""embarked on a lengthy procedure to address the serious head and facial injuries sustained by Maria in the accident"".
It said: ""The operation began yesterday afternoon and she was in theatre until this morning.
""Maria remains in a critical but stable condition.""
John Booth, team principal of the Marussia F1 Team, said: ""Maria emerged from theatre at Addenbrooke's Hospital this morning after a lengthy operation to address the serious head and facial injuries she received in the accident at Duxford Airfield yesterday.
""We are grateful for the medical attention that Maria has been receiving and her family would like to thank the Neurological and Plastics surgical teams.
""However, it is with great sadness that I must report that, due to the injuries she sustained, Maria has lost her right eye.
""Maria's care and the wellbeing of her family remain our priority at this time. Her family are at the hospital and we are doing everything possible to support them.""
De Villota sustained her injuries after her car ""suddenly accelerated"" into the back of the support lorry, according to witnesses.
BBC Radio Cambridgeshire presenter Chris Mann, who saw the accident, said: ""The top of her car and her helmet seemed to take the brunt of it.
""She didn't move for about 15 minutes.""
He said De Villota had been driving at up to 200mph during the testing, but the car was travelling considerably slower at the time of the crash.
Mr Booth said: ""With regard to the accident, we have embarked on a very comprehensive analysis of what happened and this work continues for the moment.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Hundreds of thousands of visitors to the National Mall crowded Metro stations around Washington on Tuesday, slowing movement to a crawl after the inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United States. A security tower stands over the crowd that came to watch Barack Obama's inauguration. ""All of our stations are overcrowded,"" said Lisa Farbstein, spokeswoman for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. ""It's taking hours for people to get back into the stations."" Police were holding people outside some Metro stations until there was room for them to get in, Farbstein said. But as evening fell and celebrations moved indoors, observers said crowd flow on the Metro system was smoother, if still an effort in patience. As of 7 p.m. Tuesday, the Metro had counted 973,285 passenger trips, setting a record with several hours and many miles yet to go. ""Throughout the weekend, we've effectively dealt with record-breaking crowds,"" said Metro General Manager John Catoe. ""By 5 p.m., people had taken nearly 874,000 trips, breaking yesterday's ridership record with nine more hours of service to go."" Monday's 866,681 passenger trips had been the Metro record. The Metro numbers were just one record-setting tally in a day that lived up to expectations in sheer crowd size alone. Crowds on the National Mall were so large that the National Park Service began closing portions of it by 9 a.m., three hours before Obama took his oath of office. A crowd of 1.5 million people packed the Mall for the inauguration, according to an analysis of satellite imagery provided to CNN by IHS Jane's, a leading information provider on defense, international risk and national security. Officials said the massive security for the event was running smoothly, although there had been what they described as minor miscommunications, such as a Metro station entrance being closed when it was not supposed to be. The crowd was orderly, and there had been no reports of major incidents or concerns. FBI spokesman Jason Pack said there had been no arrests related to the inauguration so far. FBI and partner agencies investigated about a dozen reports of suspicious incidents or people, but none was anything serious. About 957 people visited the medical tents on the mall for various first-aid needs. Some security screening lines ran slowly, officials said, but there had not been any major systemic problems. Earlier in the day, federal officials were reviewing an unspecified threat to disrupt the inauguration, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The FBI was investigating two ""streams of intelligence"" suggesting that Somalia-based terrorist organization Al Shabaab may have been plotting an attack timed to coincide with the event, the FBI and Homeland Security said in a joint threat advisory obtained by CNN. Security officials made some readjustments to inauguration security as a precaution and did not change the threat level, an administration official said. The ceremony went off without incident. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice designated al-Shabaab, also known as the Mujahedeen Youth Movement, a ""Foreign Terrorist Organization"" in February. The State Department calls it ""a violent and brutal extremist group with a number of individuals affiliated with al Qaeda. Many of its senior leaders are believed to have trained and fought with al Qaeda in Afghanistan."" Also Tuesday, a false alarm prompted police to temporarily close a 25-mile stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike, authorities said. Investigators had received a tip that a man headed to Washington was threatening the inaugural, but they eventually determined ""there is no danger to the public,"" FBI spokesman J.J. Klaver said. Two law enforcement sources said the man's mother phoned in a tip to authorities saying her son was traveling in a vehicle containing a bomb. New Jersey State Police stopped a man in a vehicle on the highway Tuesday afternoon, questioned him and searched his vehicle, several law enforcement sources said. Officials said he never posed a threat. It's unclear what, if any, action might be taken against the mother. Tuesday in Washington, tens of thousands of police officers, federal agents and National Guardsmen were deployed on land, water and in the air in an unprecedented effort to make sure the inauguration was secure. The security effort involved Secret Service agents; 8,000 police officers from the District of Columbia and other jurisdictions; 10,000 National Guardsmen; about 1,000 FBI personnel; and hundreds of others from the Department of Homeland Security, the National Park Service and U.S. Capitol Police. Another 20,000 members of the National Guard were ready to respond if there was an emergency, said Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff. Security planners drew up procedures to deal with improvised explosive devices, suicide bombers and the use of a weapon of mass destruction. A recent intelligence assessment, however, said a lone wolf would pose the greatest potential threat. Chertoff said an individual or small group planning to do harm is difficult to detect. ""Whether the motivation is racism or some psychological disorder ... in an open society, it is impossible to keep a single individual from doing some damage,"" he said.  Watch the anti-sniper detail prepare » . Federal officials acknowledged that the inauguration of the first African-American president could make an attractive target. Since Obama's election, the number of threats against him has increased, according to a recent federal intelligence assessment. The FBI has been especially aggressive in examining white supremacist groups. They have ramped up their anti-Obama comments, officials said, but it appears to be more talk than action. Because inaugural events are spread over four days, security is especially challenging. Organizers say they started their security planning the day after the last inauguration and ramped up their efforts in July. CNN's Jeanne Meserve, Pam Benson, Kevin Bohn, Carol Cratty and Rob Frehse contributed to this report.","Metro stations packed; some wait hours to get home .

"Editor's note: CNN has asked its journalists across the country to offer their thoughts on how the economic crisis is affecting their cities. In this installment, All Platform Journalist Jim Spellman reports from Denver, Colorado. Hari Dallakoti says business at his UPS store in Denver, Colorado, is down 25 percent. DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- The conventional wisdom here in the Mile High City is that Denver entered the recession early and is pulling out of it ahead of the rest of the country. Time and again I have heard politicians, journalists and business people tell me that it isn't so bad here, that Denver is poised to lead the nation in an economic recovery. Maybe, but the signs on the ground are a little harder to read. Down on Broadway I stop by a UPS store a couple of times a week. The owner's name is Hari Dallakoti. Dallakoti always has a smile on his face and seems to know all his customers by name -- he was calling out to me by the second time I entered the shop. People drop by to ship out packages, make copies and pick up deliveries. There is always a crowd when I have been in, but Dallakoti tells me business is down 25 percent this month versus the same time last year. ""Finally it's hitting in this area, and I believe that people are afraid of spending money,"" he says. ""It's like a ripple effect, and I think I am feeling it now."" Dallakoti says customers who once sent birthday presents across the country are now only sending cards. Also, eBay-related shipping is down, and he has seen a falloff in people sending mortgage-related documents. He has five employees and says he hasn't had to let anyone go, but he has had to cut back their hours. He agrees that business is better in Denver than in other parts of the country and is confident he will weather the economic storm, but it may be a while before things get better for him. ""In my opinion it's going to get worse for the next couple, three months, and I'm hoping it will turn around after June,"" he says.  Watch how the downturn is affecting Denver » . A block up Broadway is a little guitar store called Music Gear Guys. I play guitar, and this was one of the first businesses I stopped by when I moved to Denver in January. I have been in the shop four or five times and have been surprised that every time I drop by, the place is packed. ""The recession affected us a little last year but overall -- knock on wood -- it hasn't really affected me too much,"" says owner Gregory Decker, who thinks the recession may actually be helping his business. ""I have a feeling that people are looking for hobbies or different forms of entertainment that aren't too expensive,"" Decker explains. His store is crowded with new and used guitars, amplifiers and accessories. He says guitars based on designs from the 1960s are the hot items in the store. Like Dallakoti, the UPS store owner, Decker seems to know all of his customers by name. He says that in this economy you have to focus on customer service to stand a chance. He doesn't advertise, instead relying on word of mouth, and keeps overhead low: He is the sole employee. ""Relationships are what make my business thrive. Without them I wouldn't be as successful,"" he says. But even here in a relatively successful small business there are signs of the hard times other people have been experiencing. Beginning last year more customers started coming in to sell Decker their guitars in hopes of making ends meet. ""A lot of people are selling their gear due to job layoffs and needed the money,"" he says. The recession started with free-falling housing values and, in this respect, the signs are harder to read. Over the weekend I took my dog for a walk through my neighborhood near Sloans Lake in Northwest Denver and decided to count how many houses were for sale. In a six-block walk, I counted two houses for rent and 13 for sale, including the house next door to me. These homes sit like ghosts in the neighborhood. There are open houses on Sundays, but few people come by. The houses are all well-maintained, though most of them appear to be empty. My neighbors hope these places don't fall into foreclosure; they are worried the neighborhood will fall apart if they do. I'll be keeping my eye on the house next door, and keeping my fingers crossed that my new hometown will be back on track soon.","CNN journalist in Denver, Colorado, weighs in on how economy affecting city .

Giddy up: Nick Clegg was confident following the success at the Eastleigh by-election and seemed to mimic the Gangnam style dance during his speech . Despite woeful poll ratings yesterday . suggesting the party could lose half its seats in a General Election, he . insisted the Liberal Democrats had proved they were no longer a party . of protest. The Lib Dem . leader told a rapturous audience in Brighton they were ‘no longer the . none-of-the-above choice...we are a party that is for things, not simply . against things’. And he . spelled out what he was against by turning his fire on his Coalition . partners, saying it was the Liberal Democrats who kept the Government . ‘anchored in the centre ground’. ‘The Conservatives, on their own, will never deliver the fairer society - it’s just not who they are’, he said. ‘The . Conservative party knows it needs to stay on the centre ground to have . any chance of speaking to ordinary people’s concerns. At least the . leadership seem to. ‘But . they just can’t manage it no matter how hard they try. They’re like a . kind of broken shopping trolley. Every time you try and push them . straight ahead they veer off to the right hand side.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg called for unity in the party as he appeared to imitate solo singer Psy . He also tried to play down tensions within his party on austerity, particularly with Mr Cable, who did not address the conference and was relegated to fringe events. The unity of the Liberal Democrats is ‘what our enemies most fear’, Mr Clegg said. ‘No one will know what we stand for unless we stand together’. He told activists:’Get back out there. Tell our side of the story. And we will win again. On the doorstep, in town halls, in Government. Keep fighting for what we believe in. Keeping winning’.","Nick Clegg seemed to imitate the Gangnam Style dance made famous by Psy .

"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Lawmakers in Nepal will vote Saturday to pick the country's first president since it became a republic. Nepal became a republic after the deposal of King Gyanendra Shah earlier this year. The country's newly elected Constituent Assembly abolished a 239-year monarchy following elections in April. But with no one party winning a majority of the seats, it is unclear who may become president. The position is largely ceremonial. But a president will swear in whoever is picked as the new prime minister. The three main political parties continued to negotiate over whom to name president. The Nepali Congress wants outgoing prime minister and party president Girija Prasad Koirala for the position. The Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) wants its leader. But the Maoists -- which won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority -- do not favor either of the two men. They want a non-political figure as president.

"The basic reason is that his Catholic flock in Africa has increased faster there than in any other part of the world during the past 50 years.
The Pope has just been forced to set up a new programme of evangelisation in Europe, where Catholics have been leaving the church in ever greater numbers.
In Europe there is a serious problem of renewing an ageing priesthood.
In West Africa his flock is flourishing, despite antagonism and even violence between Christians and Muslims in several countries. New vocations are booming.
The Ouidah Catholic seminary is the burgeoning training ground for new African priests who - 150 years after the first Catholic missionaries from Switzerland established themselves there - are prepared to reverse the missionary direction and carry out pastoral work among Europeans in Europe.
But Ouidah is also a centre for traditional African religions.  It is the heartland of Voodoo, whose rituals and beliefs travelled to the Caribbean and to South America, particularly Brazil, during the centuries when slavery depopulated West Africa.
By Virgile AhissouBBC Afrique, Cotonou
Voodoo is completely normal in Benin.
People across West Africa, especially Togo, Ghana and Nigeria hold similar beliefs but in Benin it is recognised as an official religion, followed by some 40% of the population.
It has none of the negative connotations it has in the West and many of those who are officially Christian or Muslim also incorporate some Voodoo elements into their beliefs, especially in times of crisis.
But Voodoo is more than a belief system, it is a complete way of life, including culture, philosophy, language, art, dance, music and medicine.
Voodoo priests ask the gods to intervene on behalf of ordinary people but local adherents stress that they have nothing to do with sorcery or black magic.
People here do not stick needles into dolls to cause misfortune to their enemies, as you see in some Western films.
What is Voodoo?
In pictures: Voodoo priestess
There is still a Voodoo temple filled with sacred pythons in Ouidah, not far from the huge Catholic seminary.
Voodoo is a belief system with a culture which includes art, dance, music, rituals, medicine, and is expressed in several languages.
Nearly half the population of Benin still follow traditional African animist religions such as Voodoo. Many who have converted to Catholicism still refuse to abandon their former beliefs entirely.
The Catholic Church however has a problem with this. It is called syncretism, which means treating all religions on the same footing.
Right-wing Catholic traditionalists denounced the late Pope John Paul II for allegedly ""consorting with Satan"" when he invited an African animist to take part in his groundbreaking interfaith prayer for world peace in the Italian city of Assisi, the shrine of Saint Francis, back in 1986.
Pope John Paul's successor, Benedict, invited another African traditional religious leader to celebrate with him the 25th anniversary of that meeting only last month.  But this time there were no public prayers together, only private meditation.
The Catholic Church, which cannot tolerate the idea of Protestants and Catholics sharing the same communion table, has even greater difficulty in reconciling the worship of Jesus Christ side-by-side with African animists offering libations to spirits of the forest.
The Pope travelled to Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin, with a larger retinue of advisers than usual on his travels.
All the senior Vatican Cardinals who work in the Roman Curia were invited by the pope to join him for the six-hour flight.
They included Cardinal Peter Appiah Turkson from Ghana, the head of the Vatican's Council for Justice and Peace, the body which monitors human rights records not only in African countries but around the world.
Cardinal Turkson is the first Ghanaian to be appointed to the highest rank of prelates in the Catholic Church. He is even considered to be a possible candidate to succeed Benedict XVI, when the 84-year-old pontiff dies.
Another member of the Pope's retinue is Bishop Barthelemy Adoukonou, a former student of the Pope at the University of Regensburg in Germany, where he taught theology. Monsignor Adoukonou, promoted to the rank of Bishop as recently as last month, is rapidly gaining influence as an adviser in the highest ranks of the Roman Curia.
One of Pope Benedict's restricted number of engagements in Benin - but one to which he to which he attaches great importance - is a meeting with 200 sick and disabled children, who are looked after by Catholic missionaries.
He will address all the suffering children of Africa in a speech he plans to make where they live.
Another high point of Pope Benedict's visit to Benin will be a meeting with the head of state, members of the government and members of the diplomatic corps in the presidential palace.
About 3,000 people are expected to attend and Pope Benedict plans another keynote speech, in which he will refer to the many human rights abuses in Africa.
He will refer also to the role of the Church during the democratisation of the country, following Marxist rule after its independence.
Here, he also plans to greet some local leaders of traditional African religions who have been invited for the occasion.
Vatican Radio has produced its first music CD on the occasion of the Pope's African visit.
Five thousand copies will be distributed to representatives of local churches. It is called Afrika Tenda Amani and has been recorded by two popular West African musicians Papa Wemba and Bonga.","Why should Pope Benedict want to travel nearly 10,000km (6,000 miles) on a weekend visit to Africa?"
"Warner Bros TV has so far failed to reach any agreement with Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki, Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar over salaries.
Production may be delayed if new deals are not reached in the next two weeks.
According to the Hollywood Reporter, though, the cast are still expected to return to work.
The long-running CBS sitcom was extended for a further three series earlier this year.
The show, which centres on a group of high-functioning science ""geeks"", will now air until at least 2017.
The Hollywood Reporter claims that Parsons, Galecki and Cuoco currently earn $325,000 (Â£190,000) per episode and are now seeking up to $1m (Â£584,000) per show.
Such a deal would make them the highest paid actors on US television - ahead of Ashton Kutcher and Jon Cryer from Two and a Half Men, currently understood to be the most rewarded TV actors.","The original five cast members of The Big Bang Theory are still without contracts, two weeks ahead of the start of shooting of the eighth series."
"There is no doubt the perfect baby name is hard to pick, but a unique one is even harder to come by. Reddit user thebdizzle spawned a viral thread by asking: 'What are people naming their children that they really shouldn't be?', after a Facebook friend announced that they had named their child 'Dude Lorenzo'. And it seems thebdizzle was not alone in his shock over the newborn's name - which could be a tip of the hat to actor Jeff Bridges' character named 'The Dude' in cult hit, The Big Lebowski or a reference to the Ashton Kutcher movie, Dude Where's My Car?. Scroll down for video . Some parents have drawn inspiration from popular book and TV series Game of Thrones, by naming their child Khaleesi (played by Emilia Clarke, pictured) 'Well, its only 6am and I found my story of the day that makes me question my faith in humanity, thanks,' Slikrick98 wrote. While theschizophreniac agreed: 'Poor kid. I can only imagine the hilarity of his teachers referring to him as dude.' While it seems some parents took inspiration from literature - including Game of Thrones and The Hunger Games - others left Redditors scratching their heads. User technicolours also came across parents who gave the royal monikers Your Highness and Your Majesty, a new twist. Redditors have also heard of parents calling their children, Katniss, from The Hunger Games book and TV series . thebdizzle posted a screen shot of the announcement for those who did not believe him at first . A Reddit thread was started after it emerged a baby was named Dude, which could be a nod to Jeff Bridges' (pictured) character The Dude in The Big Lebowski . 'I did a clinical rotation at a pediatric facility, and I had two patients named YrHyness & YrMagesty. It's really hard not to laugh when you're asking a 3 year old, ""Does your tummy hurt YrHyness?""' they said. While Exodia101 claimed to know someone named 'iMajesty' to which Animalgeologist replied: 'Is he a new Apple product?' Other baby names included Susej (pronounced 'Suzy'), Starblanket, Cviiitlyn (a version of Caitlin), Jew'lrii ('jewellery'), Yoonik ('eunuch'), Sharkeisha, Iysabeyl (a take on Isabel), Cevyn ('seven'), Ziggy, Sincerely Yours, Macaroni and Spaghetti. Meanwhile others took inspiration from fiction and made it there own form of reality with names like Katniss from The Hunger Games, Aragorn and Elrond from The Lord of the Rings, Khaleesi from Game of Thrones and Holden from The Catcher in the Rye. Of The Hunger Games reference, bastocrat said: 'You just know that all the other kids will call her ""catp***"".' And nfriel had a bone to pick with the nod to Game of Thrones: '""Khaleesi"" is the worst. It's not even the character's name! It's a title in a made-up fantasy language.' The latest celebrity to jump on board with the unique baby names trend is former British glamour model, Katie Price. She hit back at critics last week after she was mocked for naming her newborn daughter, Bunny. The new mum wrote in her column for Now magazine: 'Bunny is an old-fashioned name and I love it. Some may ridicule our choice and some will love it - I really don't care to be honest.' Price said the name suits the tiny tot because she embodies all things a bunny rabbit represents - 'soft, cute, cuddly, unique...fun'. Other names mentioned in the thread included Starblanket, Jew'lrii, Yoonik, Sharkeisha and Iysabeyl .","A Reddit user started a thread called: 'What are people naming their children that they really shouldn't be?'

"(CNN) -- A 48-year-old man faces several charges stemming from a flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Portland, Oregon, authorities said. Donald Robert Welty is suspected of attempted assault on a police officer, disorderly conduct and harassment, according to Ansley Bernatz of Multnomah County Detention Center in Oregon. He is out on bail after his arrest Thursday. The Portland man faced federal charges of interference with flight crew and assault of a federal official, but the U.S. Marshals Service dropped a hold on Welty's detainment, Bernatz said. Details about the incident onboard were not immediately available. Representatives for the U.S. Marshals did not immediately return calls for comment.

"Manu Tuilagi is a major doubt for the World Cup after it emerged the England and Leicester star is unlikely to play again this season. The powerhouse centre, one of the first names on Stuart Lancaster’s team-sheet when fit, has not featured since October and faces a race against time to be fit for the World Cup in September after suspicions his groin injury was worse than first thought were confirmed by Leicester.

Leicester, who have conducted a root and branch review of their medical department this season, have repeatedly insisted his return is imminent despite growing rumours the problem is more serious than they have let on. In February Cockerill accused Tuilagi of inadvertently exaggerating the extent of his injury after he gave an interview saying he would not feature in the Six Nations.

As it transpired, he played no role in tournament, although he did spend time with England’s medical team and remains a valued member of the squad. But serious questions will now be asked about the management of his injury after surgery was delayed in a bid to get him fit.

"(CNN) -- I was living in Syria when the statues of Saddam Hussein in neighboring Iraq came toppling down. Saddam, who had arrogantly had his name inscribed on bricks at the ancient city of Babylon, did not expect his rule to end so abruptly, so humiliatingly. And at the University of Damascus, students told me that they expected Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to fall soon, too. They were not alone. With 250,000 U.S. troops amassed in Iraq in 2003, George W. Bush's White House had contemplated rolling American tanks into the Syrian capital. The Middle East was to be reshaped in the image of American democracy. But events in Iraq, Afghanistan, and North Korea distracted the Pentagon, and the ""democratic domino theory"" did not come to pass. Ten years after Iraq, did the war give birth to the Arab Spring? Yes, the Iraq War had indirect connections to the Arab uprisings that swept the Middle East and northern Africa in 2011. For one, the fall of Saddam must have psychologically empowered Arab opposition activists who saw that a Ba'thist dictator and his sons could be removed from power. FULL COVERAGE: The Iraq War, 10 years on . But it is a mistake to suggest that Arabs across the region were directly inspired by the fall of Saddam -- if that were true, they would have risen a decade ago. Why wait until 2011? The answer is that other, more direct developments led to the ongoing Arab revolutions. First, in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 atrocities, Arab governments used the ensuing ""war on terror"" to quell domestic dissent. When opposition Islamist parties questioned the legitimacy of Arab dictators, they were portrayed as al Qaeda sympathizers to the West, and their imprisonment in Cairo or Riyadh or Tripoli didn't raise international eyebrows. The violence of radical Islamists failed to topple strongmen in Egypt and Syria in the 1960s and 1980s. And once again, from 2001 to 2011, government repression of less radical, nonviolent Islamists signalled to a younger generation of Arabs that Islamism could not overthrow autocratic regimes. WATCH NOW: Iraq's phantom WMD . Second, as the ""war on terror"" unfolded, Islamists continued to fail in their decades-long pursuit to gain political office, and the widespread corruption and nepotism of regimes in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt sunk deeper, US support for Arab dictatorships also came into question. Then U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice put it best in June 2005: ""For 60 years, my country, the United States, pursued stability at the expense of democracy in this region here in the Middle East, and we achieved neither."" These were not just empty words. The U.S. government identified civil society organizations and financially supported NGOs through the ""democracy promotion"" agenda. During the Bush administration, annual funding for these programs exceeded the total amount spent on such programs in the entire decade to 2001, according to the 2009 budget report from the Project on Middle East Democracy. Funding for the mostly secular democracy activists was bolstered by the training provided for them in use of social media in mobilizing people. The invention and popularity of Facebook and Twitter helped young Arabs bypass communications controlled by their dictators. Even if this U.S.-funded training in creating political parties, electioneering, communication and media training only reached a small portion of the population, is it any wonder that English-speaking, elite, urban Arabs took to Facebook and Twitter to help overthrow dictators? Yes, there were local grievances and the uprisings were homegrown. The Arab uprisings belong to the Arab youth. But they were also responding by using modern technology to amplify the mood music of Western belief that Arabs too could create free societies. They were not an exception. WATCH: Lingering effects of war on Iraqis . Why else were Arab protesters' attention focused on the Obama White House as they demanded the president call on Mubarak to depart? As Turkey pressured the White House to oppose Mubarak, Saudi Arabia pressured Obama to support Mubarak -- and in that way the uprisings revolved to some degree around the messages sent from the U.S. government. The Arab Spring was going to happen with or without Saddam Hussein, but it would not have happened had it not been for the attacks of September 11. In fact, in many ways the Iraq War has prevented more from being done to aid the uprisings, hindering global resolve in attending to the killing fields of the full-blown civil war in Syria. OPINION: Media's failure on Iraq still stings . It is the ghost of Iraq that prevents the U.S. from leading attempts to topple the brutal Assad regime in Damascus. Regime change has consequences, as we learned in Iraq. There will be no new commitments to ""nation build"" again, or re-train police and security forces in a far off Arab land. The sectarianism, tribalism, Jihadism, border skirmishes and threat of chemical weapons use in Syria reminds U.S. policymakers of the American and Arab blood and treasure sacrificed in Iraq. And to what avail? The ongoing loss of life in Syria is a direct result of U.S. foreign policy blunders in Iraq. Syrians are the victims of America's Iraq adventure. So as we ponder the last decade and current Arab uprisings, let us not gloat about the ""success"" of Iraq. Iraq is not a success. It is now an ally of Iran, home to a prime minister who persecutes his own political opposition, and unashamedly supports the Assad regime in Syria. Egyptians, Yemenis, Libyans, and Tunisians were not inspired by America in Iraq. The opinions expressed in this opinion piece are solely those of Ed Husain.","Husain: Fall of Saddam Hussein pyschologically empowered Arab opposition .

"Editor's note: Frances Fragos Townsend, a CNN contributor on national security issues, served as President George W. Bush's chief anti-terrorism and homeland security adviser. Townsend has spent more than two decades in the fields of intelligence and criminal justice and has served during the past three administrations. Townsend is currently a consultant to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Program. Frances Townsend says the priority for the White House must be protecting the American people. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Washington Post recently reported that Gen. Jim Jones, President Obama's national security adviser, is reviewing plans to reorganize the White House National Security and Homeland Security councils. Some, if not all, of the functions of the Homeland Security Council may be folded into an expanded National Security Council. There is no more solemn responsibility that the president bears than to protect American lives. During my 4½ years at the White House, I came to believe that, for this reason, organization must be dictated by effectiveness. How best to maximize effectiveness will inevitably change over time as we as a country continue to weaken al Qaeda and other enemies, as the Department of Homeland Security gains strength, and as our government better integrates the capabilities that have been built since the tragedy of September 11. As the Obama administration considers the most effective means of organizing the White House structure, I respectfully submit that any structure should be judged against three fundamental criteria. First, there must be a single person both responsible and accountable to the president who monitors threat information and who has the authority to marshal all instruments of national power (military, intelligence, law enforcement, economic, diplomatic and public diplomacy) to defeat the threat. This individual cannot wait until threats arrive on our shores, but must have the responsibility and the means to identify those threats where they originate and to ensure a coordinated response to them. The president's homeland security adviser must not be constrained by geographic boundaries that our enemies do not respect. Second, the homeland security adviser must have direct and immediate access to the president. Ultimately, if terrorists successfully strike the United States, it is the president, and not his staff, who will be accountable to the American people for the failure. The homeland security adviser must be able to get to the president quickly without clearance from his or her colleagues on the White House staff. Unfortunately, there will be times when American lives are at stake and the president will need to be advised and operational decisions taken and communicated to the relevant Cabinet secretary in real time. These sorts of crises do not lend themselves to the normal bureaucratic process. Third, the homeland security issues faced by our government are diverse and many. They range from preparedness and response to natural disasters (ice, flooding, fires and wind) to pandemic planning and biological and nuclear threats. These issues are often distinct from the more traditional foreign policy issues faced by the National Security Council and require experienced staff with significant expertise. The staff must understand state and local emergency management policy issues and concerns. They must be organized, not simply to facilitate the homeland security policy process, but also to anticipate and respond to state and local political leaders in a time of crisis. The homeland security adviser requires adequate staffing to deal with the counterterrorism and homeland security issues. We remain a nation at war with a very determined enemy. We have troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the national security adviser has many important responsibilities in addition to those two theaters. For example, he must contend with the Middle East peace process and counter proliferation around the world, but most especially in Iran and North Korea. I worry that increasing the span of control of the national security adviser could dilute the homeland security mission and make it just one more item on a list already overburdened. That said, I wish to be clear. We should judge any reorganization by the substance and criteria that I have suggested above. We must be careful not to assume that a merger means the president cares less about homeland security. We must resist this easy organizational chart test and look to the substance of how responsibilities are allocated and how we are being protected. Let me suggest three questions the administration should ask before deciding on a new White House structure: (1) Is there one person responsible and accountable to the president who looks around the world at threats and advises the president?

"By . Charlie Eccleshare . Didier Drogba is known to hold a lot of influence in the Chelsea dressing room, and the returning Ivorian has flexed his muscles again by claiming back his old squad number. Oscar has worn the No 11 shirt since joining in 2012 - the year Drogba departed - but has allowed the striker to pull rank and take his preferred shirt number back. The squad number clearly means a lot to Drogba, and he took to Instagram to express his gratitude. He wrote: 'Back to my favourite shirt number 11.

The change means Oscar will take the No 8 shirt that was worn by legendary midfielder Frank Lampard, and the Brazilian is looking forward to the challenge of emulating the veteran. 'Didier is a Chelsea legend and a senior player. I am happy for him to take the 11 and for me to take the 8,' Oscar told the club's official website.

"In Silicon Valley-speak, “on demand” means requesting a service—laundry, a ride, a massage—right now. All you have to do is push that button. But of course you still have to wait for the ride to come; no one has figured out (yet) how to make it materialize out of thin air. 
  
 Now Uber wants to approximate that feeling by letting you schedule your ride ahead of time. When you need it, goes the idea, your ride just appears. 
  
 Starting today, business travelers in Seattle will be able to schedule rides 30 minutes to 30 days in advance. It’s the first step in what the company says will be a global rollout of the feature. 
  
 “Even though we’re an on-demand company, we totally get it,” says Tom Fallows, Uber’s director of global experiences. “Sometimes you just want that extra reassurance that your Uber will be there when you want to leave.” 
  
 After tapping on UberX in the Uber app, users will see a new option to schedule a ride to within a 15-minute window. You’ll set their pickup date, time, location, and destination, and you’ll be able to edit details up to 30 minutes before the pickup time. You can also cancel anytime without a penalty so long as your ride isn’t already on the way. Uber says it will send you reminders 24 hours ahead of your ride, and again 30 minutes before. 
  
 Passengers will also get a notification after the ride is on the way that includes, among other information, whether or not surge pricing is in effect. Since surge pricing is a strictly real-time computation, Fallows says, users see only the base fare when they initially order a scheduled ride. But if you’re not willing to pay the surge pricing, you have a five-minute window to cancel without a penalty after the driver is on the way. Wait longer than five minutes and the standard cancellation fee applies. (The amount varies by city: It’s $5 in San Francisco and Seattle, for instance, and 5 euros in Paris.) 
  
 What the Driver Sees 
  
 Meanwhile, the process on the driver’s end remains exactly the same. “The most efficient way to do this by far is for us to send your ride request to the nearest driver at the right moment,” Fallows says. “So from their perspective, it’s a normal ride.” 
  
 Uber does the technical heavy lifting to decide when to send the ride request out, says Fallows, which includes examining such signals as where all Uber drivers on the network are at that moment; where those drivers are headed and likely to be in the next few minutes; and how long it would take those drivers to arrive at your pickup location. Traffic is another factor, Fallows says, as is the likelihood of a driver accepting your request. 
  
 Scheduled rides go live today in Seattle, with other “top business travel cities” following soon, according to Uber. At launch, the feature is available only to users who have a business profile set up on the service, and only on the UberX tier. The announcement comes shortly after Uber’s archrival, Lyft, said it was testing a similar feature among its own employees in San Francisco. Lyft said it would like to offer scheduled rides to regular customers but has no definite plan for releasing the feature. ||||| Passengers will be able to schedule a ride up to 30 days in advance, a reversal of Uber's long-held attitude that it is an on-demand service. 
  
 Mass shooting in Orlando: Why Pulse is more than just a gay bar 
  
 An Uber car in San Francisco in May 2015. Passengers will soon be able to pre-schedule rides. 
  
 Passport, check. Toothbrush, check. Scheduled Uber pickup, check. 
  
 The ride-hailing company announced that users on their way to the airport, or in need of any pre-scheduled ride, will be able to reserve one up to 30 days in advance. The service started Thursday in Seattle, the home of Microsoft, and will expand to other “top business travel cities,” Uber wrote on its blog. 
  
 Uber is not the first ride-hailing service to offer this feature. Lyft announced in May it has started to test a similar program in San Francisco, while Gett has offered scheduled-ahead service for more than a year where it operates, USA Today reported. 
  
 As these companies upend the taxi and limousine industries, Uber’s announcement shows that it, Lyft, and Gett have found that they shouldn’t discard too many taxi and limo features in the name of “on-demand.” 
  
 “Even though we’re an on-demand company, we totally get it,” Tom Fallows, Uber’s director of global experiences, told Wired.com. “Sometimes you just want that extra reassurance that your Uber will be there when you want to leave.” 
  
 Through Uber’s new feature, a user will be able to schedule a ride 30 minutes to 30 days in advance. The feature will be offered to start just through Uber X, its less expensive, private vehicle option. A user can cancel any time before their ride is on its way, at no cost to them. Pre-scheduling won’t impact drivers, who will not be able to match with riders ahead of time, according to The Boston Globe. And users won’t be able to avoid surge pricing, in which the cost of a ride climbs at peak hours, either. 
  
 Schedule-ahead service is a reversal of Uber’s long-held stance about how, and when, it serves its customers. 
  
 “Uber is an on-demand service,” it writes on its website, on a page titled “Can I make a reservation?” “Use the Uber app to request a trip when you’re ready to ride. There’s no need to make a reservation in advance.” 
  
 Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, reaffirmed this mindset in September, when he spoke one-on-one with Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff at the cloud computing company’s Dreamforce conference. 
  
 “Do you schedule time with your shower?” said Mr. Kalanick, when asked by Mr. Benioff if Uber would introduce scheduled rides, reported Forbes. 
  
 And yet, ever since it started six years ago, Uber said it has received requests from customers for pre-scheduled rides “so they can rest assured that an Uber will be available when they need it, even if it’s for a 4 a.m. ride to the airport,” wrote Uber in Thursday’s blog post. 
  
 Taxis and limos have long offered schedule-ahead services. In fact, it’s a foundation of the limousine industry. Gett, which operates in Europe, Russia, Israel, and New York City, recognized this when it launched the service more than a year ago. Lyft was next. It started to pilot service in San Francisco about two weeks ago, and plans to expand it to other cities sometime this summer, reported PC Magazine. Lyft, though, will allow users to reserve a ride up to 24 hours in advance, compared to up to 30 days through Uber. 
  
 Uber introduced pre-scheduling in part to keep up with its rivals. Yet it’s also an indication that ride-hailing companies are learning they can’t do away with too much of the traditional model. 
  
 “If you want to really, truly upend the market, then you have to focus on perfecting the tools people use to create change,” wrote Kevin Harrington, the inventor of the infomercial, in a Forbes article. “In the end, companies don’t upend markets – customers do.” ||||| Uber’s working on making it easier for you to get a ride when you need it. 
  
 “Ride-scheduling,” unveiled June 9 on a trial basis in Seattle, is the latest feature to be added, according to the company’s blog.

 While the new feature allows riders to schedule a pickup request up to 30 days in advance, it doesn’t allow riders to match with drivers ahead of time. 
  
 Since launching its ride-sharing application six years ago, the company said on its blog that riders have wanted the ability to arrange a pickup in advance. 
  
 The company said it did not have a specific date when Boston would receive the new feature, but “other top business travel cities” will soon be added. Uber is also limiting the new feature to users it identifies as “business travelers.’’ 
  
 To use the function, users will have to select “uberX” in the app, followed by a “Schedule a Ride” option. 
  
 After filling out the appropriate information, such as pickup date and time, confirmation will be sent to the user. The company says they’ll send reminders 24 hours and then again at 30 minutes before the requested pickup time.

 The driver’s information will be shared once a match is made, like the app currently does with unscheduled rides, Uber said. 
  
 The ability to schedule a ride is a complete turnaround for Uber. 
  
 According to Forbes in 2015, Uber’s Travis Kalanick told Salesforce Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff that Uber had no plans to introduce a scheduling capability. 
  
 Roughly two weeks ago, ride-share rival Lyft also announced plans for testing ride-scheduling capabilities. According to an announcement posted May 23 on its blog, Lyft users in San Francisco can schedule rides up to 24 hours in advance. 
  
 Uder’s scheduling proposal comes on the heels of another announcement — guaranteed uberPOOL arrival time. 
  
 In a June 7 blog post, the company stated that uberPOOL users will see an “arrival time” estimate as opposed to the current travel time estimate. If you miss your “arrival time,” Uber will give you $2 off your next uberPOOL ride. 
  
 Currently, uberPOOL arrival time is only offered in Los Angeles, but the company hopes to expand it to other cities soon. 
  
 Uber said it also does not have a specific date to roll out the new uberPOOL feature in Boston. ||||| Seattle will be the first city where Uber offers scheduled rides to app users with a business profile. 
  
 Uber will allow riders to schedule a ride as early as 30 days in advance. 
  
 The new service will be first offered to business travelers in the Seattle area starting at 11 a.m. Thursday, though the company has promised quick expansion to other cities. 
  
 Hoping to please meticulous planners with loaded calendars, Tom Fallows, Uber’s director of global experiences, said the service is aimed at those who “want an extra degree of assurance Uber will be there when they head out,” such as travelers with early morning flights. 
  
 “They sleep better knowing their Uber ride is arranged,” Fallows said. 
  
 To schedule a trip, app users with a business profile choose a route and set a date and time. Scheduled rides are priced like a normal Uber ride and subject to surge pricing. 
  
 “If you’re requesting the ride at 8 a.m. on a Monday morning and it’s super high demand, surge may apply just like it normally would,” Fallows said. “We send riders a push notification on the way, notifying them if there’s any surge.” 
  
 Passengers can modify their scheduled rides before the driver has been dispatched. Once the push notification is sent and the driver is en route, users will have 5 minutes to cancel without penalty, Fallows said. 
  
 Initially, scheduled rides will be available only on UberX, but Fallows said the company plans to expand it to black cars and other Uber lines soon. 
  
 Uber chose to launch in Seattle because developers here built the system and the city has a lot of business travelers, Fallows said. 
  
 Although scheduling is a simple concept, Fallows said the architecture that runs the dispatching system requires complex algorithms that determine the right time to ask a driver to pick up a scheduled ride. 
  
 The algorithm weighs proximity, traffic obstacles and the likelihood a driver will accept a scheduled ride, among other factors. 
  
 The best driver for a given ride won’t always be the one nearest to the person requesting it, Fallows said. 
  
 For example, “We may know a driver who currently has a passenger in the car is headed to drop them off nearby your house or pickup location,” Fallows said. “The best driver to be offered your ride is not an available driver 10 blocks away, but is a driver who is currently occupied but will soon be free two blocks away.” 
  
 Fallows said Uber’s engineers in Seattle will be watching how the new feature is used and eager for feedback from customers. 
  
 “There’s nothing like having things happen in your own backyard to excite you about building and testing,” he said. |||||","– Uber has long insisted it's an ""on-demand"" ride service, meaning users weren't able to schedule rides in advance—until now.

"(CNN) -- Oscar-winning director James Cameron has plunged to the deepest known point in the world's oceans, tweeting from his one-man submersible during the process. The filmmaker reached Challenger Deep, which is part of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean, near Guam, at 7:52 a.m. Monday (5:52 p.m. ET Sunday), according to Ellen Stanley, a spokeswoman for the National Geographic Society that is working with Cameron on the project. ""Just arrived at the ocean's deepest pt,"" Cameron wrote on Twitter. ""Hitting bottom never felt so good."" At more than 10,900 meters (about 35,800 feet), the Mariana Trench is deeper than Mount Everest is tall. And it has had only two previous human visitors, as U.S. Navy Lt. Don Walsh and late Swiss explorer Jacques Piccard descended to that spot in 1960. Cameron is the first person to make the dive solo, a distinction that also had been sought by billionaire businessman and adventurer Richard Branson and Patrick Lahey, an experienced submarine pilot. The man behind the blockbuster hits ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"" went down in a high-tech vessel, the Deepsea Challenger, which he and a team of scientists and engineers constructed in Australia over the past eight years. Outfitted with special cameras and robotic arms, Deepsea Challenger is able to dive vertically at speeds of 500 to 700 feet per minute and can withstand immense pressure -- up to 16,000 pounds per square inch. Engineers and scientists joined Cameron's team during Sunday's deep sea endeavor. Earlier, he'd said he plans to spend six hours at the bottom of the trench collecting samples for research that will allow scientists on board and around the world to learn about the habitat and life forms at that depth. ""It's so exciting -- every second you see something cool or you've got something to do or you're photographing or you see some amazing fish,"" Cameron told CNN earlier this month. Scientists hope that a fresh look at Challenger Deep will provide insight into many unfamiliar life forms in the depths of the ocean. It is estimated that more than 750,000 marine species have not been formally described in scientific literature over the centuries, triple the number of those that have been. The figures exclude microbes, of which a 2010 marine life census estimates there are up to one billion kinds. The nonprofit X-Prize Foundation has announced it will award a $10 million prize to the first person to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Cameron told CNN he's not interested in competing for this prize, or any other, because his mission is purely about scientific research. ""You know, there's so much we don't know,"" Cameron said. ""I'm hopeful that we'll be able to study the ocean before we destroy it."" CNN's Adam Reiss contributed to this report.","Cameron hits Challenger Deep, part of the Mariana Trench, a spokeswoman says .

"This is a symbol to remember those who have given their lives in war.
This year, over 45 million poppies will be given out by 150,000 volunteers.
But why do we wear these red flowers to remember people in this way?
The reason poppies are used to remember those who have given their lives in battle is because they are the flowers which grew on the battlefields after World War One ended.
This is described in the famous World War One poem In Flanders Fields, which you can read below.
Ever since then, they have come to be a symbol of remembering not just those who gave their lives in World War One, but all those who have died on behalf of their country.
Every year, volunteers make poppies available throughout the country and people make a donation in order to get their poppy.
The money raised from these donations is used to help servicemen and women who are still alive, whose lives have been changed by wars that they fought in.
It might help them to get jobs and somewhere to live, and will also help older war veterans with any support they may need.
It is also used to help those who have lost loved ones because of wars.
The charity that runs this Poppy Appeal is called The Royal British Legion.
Wearing poppies like this to raise money to help people who had fought in wars started in 1921.
This was year that the Royal British Legion was founded on 15 May.
However, back then the poppies weren't made out of paper like they are today. They were made out of silk.
They sold out straight away and raised more than Â£106,000 for those whose lives had been affected by the war, by helping to find them jobs and somewhere to live once they were no longer serving in the army.
In 1922, a factory was set up where disabled former soldiers were employed to make the poppies.
This factory is still running - and producing many millions of poppies each year - to this very day.
While the majority of people wear their poppy on their chest, there is in fact no right or wrong way to wear a poppy.
As the Royal British Legion says: ""We only ask you to wear it with pride.""
In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,
That mark our place; and in the sky
The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.
-
We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
Loved and were loved, and now we lie
In Flanders fields.
-
Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
The torch; be yours to hold it high.
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields.","In the days leading up to 11 November, you will see people on the TV and in the streets wearing a poppy."

"A two-year-old boy never woke from his routine afternoon nap after being struck down by a mysterious virus, an inquest heard. Fit and healthy Elliot Kerslake is thought to have had a seizure from swelling of his brain as he suffered from an everyday cold. Hours earlier, Elliot had been showing off a dance routine for his sister's friends and cheering on his big brother Oliver, 12, at a football match. Elliot Kerslake, two, from Leeds, died in his sleep from a swelling to his brain caused by a mystery virus. Doctors have said there is 'nothing that could have saved him' His parents John and Andrea Kerslake wept as a coroner heard their written evidence about his sudden death on March 3, 2013. Mrs Kerslake, 45, said Elliot had been put down for his post-lunch nap at 2pm, and his sister found him dead three hours later. She told the coroner: 'I read him a Fireman Sam story as I put him down for an afternoon nap at 2pm just after his lunch. 'I told him I loved him and closed the curtains. Around that time John came home. I had left the door open and thirty minutes later I went back to check on him. 'He was lying on his tummy and making a little sobbing noise. I didn't think much of it as my two other children used to do the same when they were younger. 'I went in and said to him 'do you want to come down, sweetheart?', but he didn't answer.' Mrs Kerslake said she was gardening as her husband watched football on TV when their daughter Emily, now 14, screamed. They found Elliot lying 'blue and floppy' and called an ambulance to their home in Shadwell, Leeds. An operator told John how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Mr Kerslake said: 'I continued fighting for him shouting ""come on Elliot, you can do it"", although I started to feel in my mind that he was gone.'

Leeds Coroners Court heard how the energetic youngster had been playing in the garden and entertaining his sister's friends who had been on a sleepover hours before his death. Mrs Kerslake said: 'Because of the other children staying, Elliot was in our bed the night before. 'We had read bedtime stories and in the morning we had a big hug. 'We chatted about what we would do that day and I dressed him in his blue dungarees with patterned socks, so I could grab hold of him if he ran off. 'He was so excited that morning and did a little dance for his sister's friends. 'We went to Starbucks to get a coffee and he ate normally. Then later we went to see his older brother Oliver play in a football match. 'I had to wipe his runny nose quite a bit that day, but didn't think much of it. 'My husband met us at the football field at lunchtime and I remember Elliot shouting ""that's my daddy"" and ran over to him to give him a cuddle.' She added that they left to go home for lunch, where Elliot was put down for the nap from which he never woke up. Dr Richard Newton, a specialist in child neurology at Manchester Royal Infirmary, said the cause of Elliot's death was most likely encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - caused by a virus which triggered a seizure as he slept. He said: 'This was a well little boy with a cold, essentially. He went down in the afternoon for a nap which is a routine almost every family in Britain bears witness to. 'I would suggest the cause of Elliot's death to be a seizure during his nap related to encephalitis, caused by an indeterminable virus. 'There are thousands, if not millions of types of virus and it would be impossible to determine which kind.' Hours before his death, Elliot had been in a good mood. He woke up to a hug with mother Andrea, 45 (right), performed a dance for his sister Emily (left) Dr Newton added there was 'nothing that could have saved Elliot'. He said: 'The events that afternoon were common events in every household. 'He ate his lunch, had his nap and must have died within that time. 'It's part of nature's rare unkindness.' Coroner David Hinchliff said the cause of death was, on the balance of probabilities, 'inflammation of the brain caused by an indeterminable viral infection'. He recorded a verdict of natural causes. Speaking before the hearing, Mr Kerslake said: 'Elliot loved life, he relished every new experience. He gave so much love to us, his brother and sister and all that knew him. 'It's comforting to know that his short life will impact positively on others during the months and years to come.'","Elliot Kerslake, two, died in his sleep due to swelling in his brain from a virus .

"(CNN) -- Poached for use in traditional Chinese medicine or sold as exotic pets. Sometimes slaughtered in a vicious, drawn-out war. We're all familiar with the themes dominating headlines about Africa's declining wildlife. Lions, elephants and tigers, one might think, will exist only in sad tales told to children in a decade or two. Yet amid the disturbing news, one African wildlife success story stands out like the sun rising over the Serengeti -- and it's great news for travelers. With sustainable wildlife tourism as the long-term goal, the southern African nation of Namibia has been making ambitious commitments to habitat conservation since its independence in 1990. Almost half of country protected . The nation of 2.2 million people was the first African country to write environmental protection into its constitution. More than 40% of Namibia is now under some form of conservation management. Officially inaugurated in March 2012, the KAZA (Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area) initiative established a 100,000-square-mile, five-nation conservation zone -- the world's largest. Encompassing the entire Caprivi Panhandle in Namibia, KAZA's ""conservation beyond borders"" approach protects wildlife corridors shared by Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Central to the effort are the communal conservancies -- rural communities that share the proceeds of wildlife ventures equitably between members -- that now cover one-fifth of the country and affect 250,000 rural Namibians. Human-wildlife conflict reversed . In many cases, poachers have become protectors, as Namibians have come to appreciate the long-term benefits of living with wildlife. Generations of human-wildlife conflict are being reversed, while communities are made stakeholders. Much of Namibia's wildlife is now flourishing. This is also good news for travelers. With more than 30 conservancy lodges dotting the Caprivi Panhandle and north-central regions -- Namibia's wildlife hotbeds -- visitors are privy to some of the most unforgettable wildlife encounters in Africa. Five top Namibian wildlife lodges . Susuwe Island Lodge . This remote island lodge in Namibia's eastern Caprivi is a gateway to wildlife spotting along the Kwando River and perennial wetlands.

"Updated: Michael Wolff To Head E5 Global’s Adweek Group 
  
 Updated: Several more sources have confirmed that Michael Wolff will be joining E5 Global Media as the editorial director of the Adweek Group of magazines. While all acknowledge that major change is needed in terms of the group’s strategic direction, many are uncertain if Wolff is the person to provide it. As one source put it, “How does [E5 Global Media CEO Richard] Beckman go from Peter Kaplan to [Wolff]? Does he have a plan or is he flailing for a big name?” We will probably find out as soon as this afternoon, according to additional sources. Other sources also said that the announcement had been delayed on Friday due to Beckman being out of town. The expectation is for a formal announcement on Monday, or Wednesday at the latest. SEE ALSO: Wolff On Times: Liddle, AA Gill, Lawson And I Are Fundamentally Useless Original post: We’re hearing a great deal of rumbling about dramatic changes coming Friday to E5 Global Media’s Adweek Group, including the strong possibility that professional media provocateur Michael Wolff could be announced as the group’s editorial director. And with that, comes the expectation that after years of hanging together separately, Adweek, Brandweek and Mediaweek could eventually be combined into one single publication. Repeated emails to Wolff, who currently sits on the board of Newser.com, the aggregation site he founded three years ago, and E5 Global CEO Richard Beckman, were not returned. 
  
 At the publications, lower-level staffers are concerned and senior execs are staying mum. One exception: an elliptical evening tweet from Adweek Digital Editor Brian Morrissey predicting “tmrw should be an interesting day at the office. 
  
 Newser CEO Patrick Spain told us Thursday that he hadn’t been informed of Wolff taking the job, but said that it shouldn’t affect the company. “He blogs for us, he’s founder and a director but not actively involved in operations.” He added, “I’ve never been too focused on Michael’s outside activities.” Those include his column for Vanity Fair and a new gig as contributing editor to Wired. 
  
 Rumors that Wolff is joining E5 Global began after ex-Daily Finance media reporter Jeff Bercovici wrote that Wolff had been sighted three times at the E5 Global’s offices late last month. Both E5 Global and Daily Finance’s parent, AOL (NYSE: AOL), have offices in the same building. 
  
 E5 Global, which bought eight of Nielsen’s media-entertainment related trade mags, including The Hollywood Reporter, Billboard, Adweek, Brandweek and Mediaweek at the end of last year, has been trying to find an editorial director since the start of the summer.

A two-year-old boy playing with his toy wheelbarrow was bowled over by a kangaroo which then pinned him down and tried to claw him to death. The screaming child's terrified parents ran at the animal and managed to chase it away - but not before it left Zakkiah Galea with severe wounds to his face and body. His mother Nicole Galea last night told how the aggressive kangaroo left her in fear that her son had received fatal injuries in the attack on the family's ten-acre property at Port Macquarie, in northern New South Wales. In hospital: Two-year-old Zakkiah Galea was playing in his garden in New South Wales when he was attacked by a kangaroo which tried to claw him to death . Mrs Galea, who is eight-months . pregnant, said: 'The kangaroo was on top of him. He was pinned to the . ground while it clawed at his forearms. 'I screamed at the kangaroo to get off him but it wouldn't - it just kept on attacking.' It . was only when Zakkiah's father, Andrew Galea, rushed to help his wife . fight off the kangaroo that the animal finally ran off into nearby . bushland. 'It turned on Andrew first before hopping away,' Mrs Galea told Sydney's Daily Telegraph. 'It was just awful to see Zakkiah. He had a bloody face and blood had soaked through his shirt. 'There was a deep puncture in his chest and a gash on the top of his leg. He had two large gouges from his mouth to his ear.'

His mother said: 'He scared. He says he doesn't want to be attacked by the ""tiger kangaroo"" again.' Other people in the remote neighbourhood have been attacked by kangaroos, said Mrs Galea, and she suspected urban development was to blame - new houses forcing the animals into human environment. Peter Clark, of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, said people should be aware that kangaroos are wild animals of substantial size and power and might react instinctively and attack if they are startled. He suggested that people living close to kangaroos should fence off their properties and remove food, shelter and water opportunities. He also suggesting turning on water sprinklers to discourage the animals from gathering.","Zakkiah Galea, two, pinned down in New South Wales .

Suleman, known in the media as ""Octomom"" because she gave birth to eight babies in one day, must also serve two years on probation and work 200 hours of community service under a plea deal announced Monday. The Los Angeles district attorney accused Suleman, 39, of not reporting nearly $30,000 she earned as a topless dancer and adult film actress in the months after she applied for public assistance for her 14 children last year. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge David Horwitz accepted Suleman's no contest plea to a single misdemeanor charge in court Monday after she proved she had paid the restitution to the state and county. Suleman could have gotten up to six years and four months in prison if convicted of all four charges that had been pending, the prosecutor said.

"A woman who spent a decade trying every diet under the sun has undergone a body transformation in just 12 weeks. Lisa O'Daly, 33, from South East London, struggled with her shape since her early 20s and has never managed to shift excess weight, especially around her middle. After giving everything from Weight Watchers to the Dukan diet a go over the last 10 years, she finally got the toned, taut body she dreamed of after discovering weightlifting, and pairing it with a healthy diet. Scroll down for video . Lisa's body fat percentage went from 24 per cent to 19 per cent, and she lost 2.3kgs in just 12 weeks . While her weight only dropped 5lbs from 9st 12lbs to 9st 7lbs, her size changed dramatically. The former size 14 can now fit into size 8 clothes, and her body fat percentage has dropped from 24 to 19 per cent, showing off her toned muscles. Lisa said: 'I've tried every diet you can think of but nothing really stuck. At first, it was bizarre muscling my way into the weights room at the gym.' Lisa had spent every year since she finished university trying two or three diets a year. Her eating plans included the Zone diet, the 5:2 diet, weight watchers, Carol Vorderman's 21 day detox, No carbs after 5pm, Low carb evenings, the Ducan diet, and juice fasting. But Lisa yo-yoed and couldn't keep the weight off, ranging between a size 8 and 16 over 10 years. As soon as she was under stress she would turn to doughnuts, chocolate and coffee and would skip the gym when her job in HR got busy. She embarked on the USN fitness programme that combines healthy eating with intense weight training . All her eating and exercise habits have changed and she's clued up on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle . When her friend Tarryn suggested she try the Ultimate Sports Nutrition programme Lisa never thought she would find herself at home with bench pressing in the weights section. But in just 12 weeks of the fitness programme that combines healthy eating with intense weight training she lost 2.3kg and developed a six pack. The free body transformation challenge is based around a five day programme with two rest days, booked online, but the optional USN supplements and shake powders are paid for, available through their website. Thanks to switching snacking on Ben and Jerry's and Dairy Milk to lean meat, veg and brown rice Lisa sent her body fat from 24 per cent down to 19 per cent. She followed a plan of daily exercise to tone her abs, arms and legs and tried out protein supplements to help kick-start her complete makeover which saw her go from a size 14 to a size 8. Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Three courses of soup with bread, cheesy pasta, and a cake for desert . Dinner: Large spaghetti bolognese . Snack: Lots of full-fat milk coffees, doughnuts . Pre and post-workout whey protein shake . Breakfast: Porridge . Lunch: Salad with grilled chicken, brown rice . Dinner: Fish with steamed vegetables . Snacks: Handful of nuts . Pre-workout USN supplements: Xedra Cut Slim Pack and CLA Thermo . She took protein supplements to help her complete makeover which saw her go from a size 14 to a size 8 . Day 1 – Legs and abs (squats, lunges, free weights) Day 2 – Chest and triceps (flat bench dumbbell presses and overhead chest extensions) Day 3 – Shoulders (overhead presses and raises) Day 4 – Back and biceps (barbell rows, dead lifts and curls) Day 5 – Circuit with plank and crunches . Lisa followed the USN programme pretty closely, working out for 45 minutes a day throughout the 12 weeks, for five days a week with two days off. She gradually increased the weights as she got further through the programme. Week 1 - arm curling 2kg, leg press 65kg . Week 12 - arm curling 8kg, leg press 200kg . Lisa said: 'I'd started loads of diets, and sometimes finished them, but it never worked. I'd fall back into my old eating habits and put it all back on. 'I thought I was eating healthily and even went to spin classes at the gym but I still had rolls around my stomach. I assumed food was good for me just because it says low carb and low fat on the label. I assumed it was good for me. 'I wasn't obese or and people didn't look at me and think I was fat, but I wasn't happy and I knew that I needed to lose a few pounds. When I hit 11 and a half stone I became officially classed as overweight and that shocked me into action. But I wanted to do something that was maintainable which USN is. 'The weight came off really quickly and after just six weeks people were noticing that I'd changed. 'But it's stayed off too.

"More than 20 years after a New Mexico woman garnered headlines after she sued McDonald’s over a scalding cup of coffee, a 5-year-old girl has won a six-figure settlement in Buffalo federal court for a similar incident at a Thruway rest stop. 
  
 The family of the young girl sued the owners of a Denny’s restaurant in Angola in 2012, took the case to trial and recently agreed to a court-approved settlement of at least $500,000. 
  
 The girl, who was only 14 months old at the time, suffered first- and second-degree burns over her neck, chest and abdomen. 
  
 Her parents, Jose Adames and Sally Irizarry of Puerto Rico, sued the restaurant’s owners after their daughter grabbed a hot cup of coffee and spilled it on herself in 2010. They claim the waitress was negligent in placing the coffee within the infant’s reach. 
  
 “Sometime after the family is seated, a cup of coffee is placed on the table, which the infant was able to grab and dump on herself,"" the family said in court papers. 
  
 The case went to trial last month, but midway through, an insurance carrier for G.B. Restaurants, the company that owned the now-closed Denny’s along the Thruway, offered to pay $500,000 to the family. 
  
 The final settlement, approved by U.S. Magistrate Judge Hugh B. Scott, remains confidential but it is believed to be near the $500,000 previously disclosed in court papers. 
  
 Lawsuits over hot cups of coffee became fodder for the ongoing national debate over personal injury lawsuits when 79-year-old Stella Liebeck successfully sued McDonald’s in 1992. Liebeck’s Styrofoam cup of coffee spilled on her lap outside one of the chain’s restaurants in New Mexico, causing third-degree burns. 
  
 When she filed suit against the chain, she became a lightning rod of sorts. But her lawyers will tell you that, in the end, the facts proved McDonald’s was negligent. 
  
 They said the chain had a policy of serving its coffee at 180 degrees, a temperature hot enough to cause serious burns. They also say the company received more than 700 complaints from customers in what amounted to a clear red flag. 
  
 In some ways, the Buffalo case mirrored the suit in New Mexico. There were claims about the coffee being kept at overly hot temperatures, and there was testimony during the trial from medical personnel who worked on the infant. 
  
 The family also provided evidence that their daughter will require lifetime medical care at a cost of more than $340,000. 
  
 “They continue to worry about her health and welfare now and into the future,” the family’s lawyer said of the girl’s parents. 
  
 John W. McCandless, the Erie, Pa., lawyer who represented the infant’s family, and Robert W. Gallagher, who represented the restaurant owners, said they could not comment because of the confidential nature of the settlement. 
  
 email: pfairbanks@buffnews.com ||||| BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) – The family of a 5-year-old girl from Puerto Rico has reached a $500,000 settlement in Buffalo Federal Court after the girl suffered severe burns at a Denny’s restaurant in Angola. 
  
 Tatyana Adames was 14-months-old when she and her parents stopped at the restaurant along the thruway for breakfast in June, 2010. According to court documents, Tatyana was seared by scalding hot coffee that an inattentive Denny’s waitress had placed within her reach. She suffered first and second degree burns to her neck, chest, and abdomen. 
  
 The family filed suit against the owners of the Denny’s in 2012, and the case recently went to trial. Then, Farmer’s Insurance, which covers the now-closed restaurant’s owners, offered to pay $500,000 to settle the suit. Court papers show the family accepted the offer, and U.S. Magistrate Judge Hugh B. Scott approved the final settlement. Although that final settlement is sealed, it is believed to be for the previously disclosed amount of $500,000. 
  
 This case comes more than 20 years after a woman in New Mexico won her lawsuit against McDonalds after she spilled hot coffee on herself. In that instance, the 79-year-old woman suffered third degree burns from spilling her coffee on her lap. Her lawyers successfully claimed the chain was negligent in keeping its coffee at an excessive 180 degrees. 
  
 In the case of Tatyana Adames, there were also claims that the coffee was kept at an overly hot temperature. Because of her injuries, patches of skin came off when Tatyana’s clothing was first removed after the spill. Her medical providers had to remove the rest of the dead skin while Tatyana was under “conscious sedation”. She was in the hospital in Erie, Pennsylvania for several weeks, far away from her home in Puerto Rico. She also now suffers from an inflammatory reaction when exposed to the heat of Puerto Rico, which makes her skin break out in red, painful, itchy rashes. 
  
 A Denny’s handbook providing instructions for employees states that waitresses should “Never set hot items directly in front of a child”. 
  
 Medical advocates estimate the lifetime cost of care for Tatyana’s injuries will exceed $340,000. |||||","– The hot-coffee (and cider) lawsuits keep rolling in. In the latest case, parents sued a Denny's location in Angola, New York, after their one-year-old daughter was burned by coffee. The now-5-year-old girl's case has been settled for at least $500,000. Parents Jose Adames and Sally Irizarry argue that a waitress negligently put the coffee within the girl's reach, the Buffalo News reports. The girl received first- and second-degree burns, and the family says the cost of medical care throughout her life will run to some $340,000. Some of her skin was pulled off when her clothes were removed, and health workers put her under ""conscious sedation"" to remove the remaining dead skin, WIVB reports. As in the famous McDonald's coffee case, plaintiffs held that the coffee was too hot. Denny's handbook for wait staff says workers should ""never set hot items directly in front of a child,"" WIVB notes."
"By . James Chapman and Jason Groves . Last updated at 11:32 PM on 9th December 2011 . Nick Clegg is facing a mutiny from his own party after supporting David Cameron’s decision to wield the veto. The Deputy Prime Minister backed the Prime Minister’s negotiating position after being telephoned by him in the early hours of yesterday to discuss the unfolding events. But Mr Clegg apparently believed the veto would not be necessary, as France and Germany would roll over and make concessions to Britain to maintain treaty change at the level of all 27 EU countries. Showing the strain: Nick Clegg (right) has come under fire from his own party after backing David Cameron's decision to veto the eurozone rescue package (file picture) In Europe's periphery? Mr Cameron looks anxiously at German Chancellor Angela Merkel at yesterday's eurozone summit in Brussels after wielding the veto . The failure of the deal and use of the veto has left the overwhelmingly pro-EU Lib Dems close to a state of crisis – with senior ministers said to be ‘deeply concerned’. They fear the Coalition will be put under unprecedented strain and sources warned that any Tory moves to loosen ties with the EU further would lead to open revolt among the Lib Dem membership. Former party leader Lord Ashdown said: ‘There will be a huge price to pay and, as a consequence, the foreign policy priorities of this country for the past 40 years has gone down the plughole in a single night. 'That foreign policy has now been hijacked by the Eurosceptics in the Conservative Party aided by a Prime Minister who was not prepared to stand up for the national interest.’ Damning criticism: Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott (left) said it was a 'black day for Britain and Europe’, while former party leader Lord Ashdown (right) said there will be a 'huge price to pay' further down the line . He told the Guardian: ‘As a consequence . we have lost control of the European agenda and the Prime Minister has . lost control of the demands for a referendum. This has been Gallic . payback time for the way in which Cameron went around Europe lecturing . Sarkozy on what to do.’ Prominent Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott, a close political ally of the Business Secretary Vince Cable, described the summit outcome as ‘a black day for Britain and Europe’. He said: ‘We are now in the waiting room while critical decisions are being taken. With the western economies and our banking system on the edge of a cliff, we should not be putting special pleading for special interests in the City of London above our vital national interest of working closely together with Germany and France to keep our economy and jobs all over Britain safe.’ Lorely Burt, chairman of the Lib Dem parliamentary party, said it was unclear why Mr Clegg had agreed to the decision. She said: ‘I gather Cameron phoned our illustrious leader before he decided to do this. There must have been reasons. I don’t see them at the moment.’ Lib Dem MP Martin Horwood said the UK . was facing a ‘worst-case scenario’ of isolation in Europe. Mr Horwood . said the result was not the ‘ideal outcome from a Lib Dem point of . view’. Labour leader Ed Miliband has accused David Cameron of leaving Britain 'on the sidelines of Europe' Furious: Mr Miliband, a staunch pro-European, said Mr Cameron caved into the demands of Tory Eurosceptics . But he blamed Tory Eurosceptics for pushing the Prime Minister into a corner. He added: ‘It will make it more difficult for us to exercise the kind of influence that we all want over the future of the European single market and the future of the European economy.’ Lib Dem MEP Chris Davies accused the Government of adopting a ‘xenophobic’ approach to Europe. ‘Far from keeping Britain strong, Cameron has ensured that we will lose our influence at the top table,’ he said. ‘By seeking to protect bankers from regulation, he has betrayed Britain’s real interests and done nothing in practice to help the City of London. ‘The fear now must be that we will increasingly lose the opportunity to affect decisions being taken that are bound to affect us.’ Fellow MEP Sharon Bowles warned the UK face ‘revenge attacks’ from the rest of Europe. She said: ‘There is already mood music within the parliament that if the UK wants it some people will take a great deal of satisfaction in making sure we don’t have it.’ By contrast, Mr Cameron’s position in his own party has been greatly strengthened – though he will now face renewed demands for a referendum as the other members of the EU forge a fiscal union. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said it was tempting to say well done to Mr Cameron, but insisted he had 'gained nothing' London Mayor Boris Johnson – who piled . pressure on Mr Cameron in the run-up to the summit, and has been . increasingly touted as a leadership rival – said: ‘David Cameron has . played a blinder and he has done the only thing that was really open to . him to do.’ Eurosceptic MPs cheered the result – but made it clear that they would step up the pressure on Mr Cameron at Westminster to go further in distancing Britain from the heart of the new European project. Tory MP Stewart Jackson, who quit the Government over Europe in October, hailed Mr Cameron’s stance as a ‘paradigm shift in our relationship with the EU’, which made a referendum more likely. Temporary truce: Boris Johnson, increasingly touted as a leadership rival, said Mr Cameron had 'played a blinder' He added: ‘There is going to be inevitable pressure for further repatriation of substantial powers, and people may well be asked before the end of this parliament for their view on an in-or-out referendum.’ The leading Eurosceptic Bill Cash said the decision to wield the veto was a ‘historic moment for Europe. He added: ‘We are now embarked on a very serious, responsible path towards renegotiating the whole of our treaty relationship.’","Deputy PM had backed David Cameron's decision to use veto on rescue plan .

"CAIRO, Egypt (CNN) -- An Egyptian real estate mogul and a former police officer pleaded not guilty Saturday to the murder of a rising Lebanese pop singer who was found slain in her United Arab Emirates apartment. Lebanese singer Suzanne Tamim was found slain in her apartment in Dubai in July. Prosecutors allege that Hisham Talaat Moustafa, a Parliament member for the ruling National Democratic Party, paid Muhsen el Sukkari $2 million to kill Suzanne Tamim. Both have denied the charges. Tamim, 30, was found in her Dubai apartment in July with her throat slit. Moustafa's lawyer told CNN his client loved the singer, but could not take Tamim as a second wife because his family objected. Polygamy is legal in Egypt, and it not unusual for men -- such as Moustafa, a married father of three -- to take on additional wives. The prosecutors say the murder was a ""means of taking revenge"" but have not elaborated.  Watch report on murder trial » . ""It did not happen and I have presented all the evidence that I am not guilty,"" Moustafa said in the courtroom Saturday, according to Reuters. ""It did not happen,"" Sukkari said, according to Reuters. ""By Almighty God, my blood is innocent of her."" Although Tamim was killed in the United Arab Emirates, the Egyptian judiciary is trying the case in Cairo because Egyptian law does not allow its citizens to be extradited for trials in other countries. The defendants appeared Saturday in cages -- as is typical in Egypt -- before three judges in a crowded downtown courtroom. Heavy security surrounded the building, amid a crush of reporters and onlookers. The case, with its high-profile victim and defendant, has captivated Egypt and the region. After his arrest in September, Egyptian authorities indicted Moustafa, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and jailed him pending trial. He also resigned as chairman of Talaat Moustafa Group -- a conglomerate with construction and real estate arms that was founded by his father, Talaat Moustafa. Moustafa's brother, Tarek Talaat Moustafa, now chairs the company. The case will resume on November 15. The defendants will remain jailed until then.","Lebanese pop singer Suzanne Tamim found with throat slit in Dubai apartment .

"By . Louise Boyle . and Lydia Warren . Missing: Avonte Oquendo, 14, ran away on October 4 and his remains could have been found . Authorities investigating whether remains found washed up on a New York beach belong to missing autistic teenager Avonte Oquendo have also found a skull, according to reports. A decomposed torso, left arm, legs and a sneaker . were found on a northern Queens beach last Thursday and authorities said . the clothes were similar to those worn by the 14-year-old when he went . missing in October. Authorities told DNAinfo that searchers also found a head on Sunday and have now found most of the body. Ten teeth are missing, which could make it hard to identify the body through dental records. But Avonte's family said they fear foul play if the body is his - because it was wearing unfamiliar underwear. The family's lawyer, David Perecman, told the New York Post that he is concerned about the large Fruit of the Loom underwear found on the remains because Avonte didn't wear 'large' and wore only the Hanes brand. 'If it is him, what that indicates to me is that something happened,' Perecman said. 'Someone got a hold of him, moved him. I can't say they harmed him, but why would the underwear have gotten changed?' The . remains were taken to the Queens County Morgue to be positively . identified, and authorities are now awaiting the results of a DNA test. They could have an answer by Wednesday. A police source confirmed to the Wall Street Journal that the clothing matched what Avonte was wearing when he disappeared on October 4 from the Riverview School in Long Island City. Search: An arm, torso and legs were discovered along the Queens shoreline on Thursday and authorities said the clothes found were similar to those worn by Avonte when he vanished three months ago . Hunt: An NYPD canine unit continues the search for human remains on Friday. Authorities said a DNA test this week will determine whether or not the remains belong to the missing teenager . Skeletal remains were found on a Queens beach on Thursday night and were removed by the medical examiner. There are fears that the body parts belong to missing teenager Avonte Oquendo . Perecman also confirmed the pant and shoes sizes match what the 14-year-old was wearing the day he went missing. The Oquendo family were notified by the NYPD and are awaiting further information. The remains were found at least nine miles from where the child was last seen. For months, the boy's family has . organized search parties to scour the city for him, placed missing . posters on the subway and in stores and raising a $95,000 reward. In . particular, subway tunnels were hunted as the teenager is fascinated . with the transit system. A recording of his mother's voice was even . played over tannoys in the hope of reaching the boy. The 14-year-old is particularly vulnerable because his type of autism leaves him unable to speak and in need of 24-hour care. There have been a few sightings of . teenage boys who closely resemble Avonte, raising the family's hopes - . but he remains missing. Fears: But David Perecman, the family's attorney, pictured, said the underwear found on the remains does not match the type that Avonte wore - leading his family to fear foul play . Vanessa Fontaine, left, Avonte's mother, arrives at a vigil for her son on October 11 in Queens. The missing boy's family have been informed of the discovery of human remains . Avonte Oquendo disappeared from his Long Island City school, New York on October 4. The remains were found on a Queens beach nine miles from where he was last seen . On January 5, the family posted a message on the Facebook page that they have set up to help find the boy pleading for FBI involvement. The message thanked volunteers for their continued help in looking for the missing teen over the winter holidays. The . message continued: 'We would like to clarify that we have sought the . help of the FBI and had petitioned them to take the lead in the . investigation regarding Avonte. 'There . are several legal reasons they gave us for not being legally permitted . to take over the investigation. The most noted is that the NYPD has . listed Avonte as a missing person, not a victim of kidnapping or other . such federal offense(s) that would require the FBI's involvement. 'It is our deepest desire for the FBI to get involved but there is a . system in place that requires protocol, we cannot force the FBI to get . involved and we continually ask and pray they do.' Runaway: CCTV footage shows Avonte Oquendo running through the corridors of his school towards the exit on October 4 . On camera: Avonte left his school on October 4 through a security door that had been left open . Avonte Oquendo is seen on the street outside his school on October 4 before he turned the corner and disappeared out of sight . A Department of Education investigation has also taken place into how the autistic boy managed to get out of his special needs school and how teaching staff handled his disappearance. Avonte's . mother Vanessa, along with police, were not informed of his disappearance until . at least an hour after he ran from the school building. The . school failed to go into lockdown mode while none of the administrators . had passwords to access the surveillance cameras at the school on the . day of Avonte's disappearance, according to Capital New York.

"Arsene Wenger believes his Arsenal side may have 'switched off' towards the end of their victory over Crystal Palace as they escaped with a 2-1 win. The visitors had eased into a two-goal lead at half-time courtesy of an early Santi Cazorla penalty and an Olivier Giroud strike just before the break.

Arsenal moved third with the win and, although Wenger praised the fighting spirit of his players, he conceded they suffered a lapse in concentration as Palace pinned them back in search of a point. 'Certainly they thought that it was done,' he said of his players. 'We know in the Premier League that it's never done, especially at 2-0. With that ball on the post we were a bit fortunate. 'We can learn from every game. I believe that the players know that maybe they switched off a little bit too early. Overall I still must say that our central defenders played very well today against a very direct and a very physical game at the back. 'We missed goal number three and when they came back to 2-1 we were a bit lucky, a bit fortunate. We did well so overall I'm pleased to have won three points in a place like this.

'The first goal was a mistake by Pape - he should do better, although it was tough on us because it looked like the incident was outside the box,' he said. 'The second goal was offside. That call should have been made. A minute before half-time you've got to get that call right.' Despite the defeat, Pardew hailed the performance of his side as the best he has seen since taking over at Selhurst Park at the turn of the year. 'We took a tactical decision to take the game to Arsenal,' he added. 'We continued with the game-plan and I was very pleased with the reaction. Its probably the best we've played since I've been manager. 'The chance when it hit that post and it fell in to the goalkeeper's hands summed our day up. I thought it was going to spin into the net.

"(CNN) -- The Achilles heel of America's policy against terrorism is its failure to counter the narratives that inspire individuals to become extremists and terrorists. That's why -- despite the skill and numerous successes of our military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies -- the type of tragic events seen most recently with the stabbings of soldiers in London and outside Paris, and the April bombing of the Boston Marathon, will continue to occur. We're failing to use a key weapon that needs to be used. There's no question that the United States has been extremely effective tactically against al Qaeda and other terrorist groups since 9/11. Our military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies have done what they were charged with doing, from routing them in Afghanistan to hunting down Osama bin Laden to thwarting plots against New York. But this isn't enough. For as long as extremists are able to attract new recruits, they'll keep producing replacements for those killed or apprehended and the battle will never end. This is why the strategic tool known as ""countering violent extremism,"" or CVE, has to be used alongside special operations, drones and other weapons. As an FBI Special Agent, I interrogated dozens of senior terrorists. It quickly became clear that part of al Qaeda's effectiveness in gaining recruits was in their tailoring their rhetoric and their messenger to the personality, location and likely local grievances of their target. Extremists won't use a Yemeni railing about U.S. ""crimes"" in Iraq to try to appeal to American-Somali youths in Minnesota. They'll find someone with as close a background as possible, and who understands grievances that resonate, such as foreign powers intervening in Somalia's affairs. Once a person is recruited they are indoctrinated with the group's counterculture. Asymmetrical groups like al Qaeda often develop their own countercultures, with certain religious texts, events and a consciousness that allows them to in many ways create their own religion within Islam. It isn't an ideology. That's factually inaccurate and gives it undeserved credit. It's a false narrative. As I travel around the world today, I've seen how that counterculture, once centered in Afghanistan and Pakistan, has worryingly spread to places like Nigeria and Southeast Asia. Its spread is helped by today's new technological tools: Recruitment is not just happening in training camps and in secret meeting rooms, but in Internet chat rooms and through social media. That has been a major factor in the increase in homegrown terrorism in the West, seen horrifically on May 22 on the streets of London and April 15 at the Boston Marathon. In his recent speech on terrorism, President Obama told the nation that the values the United States holds will ultimately defeat the terrorists. This will be the case as long as we take the steps to effectively deploy our message. We need to counter extremists in the same manner that they recruit: Targeting extremists with the ideal medium, messenger and message. A mistake the United States has been making to date is in repeatedly making broad gestures toward the Muslim world and the U.S. Muslim community, making the argument that the United States is a friend. These broad messages don't have an impact on those who need to be targeted. The United States is working on developing a CVE program, but it has mistakenly spread the domestic portfolio across a range of agencies, from the Department of Education to the FBI. This makes it difficult to have a clear and effective strategy, and also hampers efforts: Charging law enforcement with both collecting intelligence on suspected extremists as well as handling community engagement programs creates natural conflicts and means that neither job can be done effectively. The ideal situation is one in which the federal government provides support to local efforts to deal with local extremists and recruitment factors, not by imposing a strategy dictated from Washington. This requires local communities -- whether in New York or in Sana'a, Yemen -- to step up and take the lead in increasing the resiliency of their communities against these groups by identifying what the extremist narratives are and where they're spreading -- and then by countering them. When people are being recruited because of alleged local or tribal grievances, it is community leaders who are the best messengers to counter that narrative. When it's a distortion of Islam, it's the duty of religious leaders to take the lead. Sometimes it's former extremists, who have taken the same path and have credibility, who can be the most effective messengers. The best CVE programs, such as Singapore's, do this. They have a focused aim of reducing the pool of potential recruits and the appeal of violence, and they target accordingly. When done correctly, CVE should not be an excuse for broad social work or for anthropological studies; it's a focused counterterrorism weapon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ali Soufan.","U.S. has been effective tactically vs. al Qaeda, since 9/11, says Ali Soufan .

"It is a ticking timebomb hidden on the chaotic streets of New Delhi. Despite India’s booming economy, millions of people are still battling for access to clean water. The situation is so desperate that many people in this teeming neighbourhood are falling sick. Others have set up illegal taps in a bid to cash in. CNN correspondent SARA SIDNER reports from the frontline of the war for water. New Delhi, India’s capital and the political heart of this diverse and vibrant country, is a vast and energetic city. One of the so-called ‘BRIC’ nations, alongside China, Russia and Brazil, the country’s growing importance and remarkable growth is delivering new wealth to many of its citizens. Around New Delhi you can see how the expanding middle classes are changing the face of India, with fresh prosperity expanding their ranks at a dramatic rate. But the city also faces a serious problem. Water, the absolute necessity for life, is becoming harder to come by. And it is not just in India’s great cities where a growing crisis is taking shape. Shazadi, a mother of six, scrubs her thin . steel dishes as hard as she can with as little water as possible. There . is only one way for her to get water: she must walk to the . neighbourhood spigot with heavy buckets, before filling them up and . lugging them home. Every one of these children, pictured on the outskirts of Delhi, India, has suffered from waterborne illnesses . But even when she gets the water back to her family, she worries whether it is actually safe to drink. 'We get sick two to three times per month,' Shazadi says. 'I cannot afford bottled water.' Her seven-year-old daughter, Moazmin, smiles and waves at us. She wants to play, but isn't feeling very well. 'My stomach aches and gurgles,' she says, before talking about the many times she has been to the hospital. There she is often given an injection, which she makes clear she is not fond of at all. There are around 100,000 people living in this neighbourhood on New Delhi's outskirts. Not one of them has ever had water piped into their homes. Instead, the government turns on just a single tap for them, just three times a day. This is how the vast majority in this part of the city gets access to water. At the pipe, people line up to fill their bottles and buckets. Children also take showers under the flowing water. The tap itself juts out just a few inches from a drain, which is littered with rubbish and sewage, as well as clumps of bright green algae. These people are among thousands in New Delhi who rely on truck deliveries for their water supply . To avoid the need to use this single tap a few enterprising people in the area have installed ground water pumps, but these are illegal. Some others get their drinking water from Prakash Sahoo. He has made a business of providing water to residents and businesses. Every day, in the baking hot sun, he rides his bicycle around the neighbourhood, making five or six trips to fill a large water container, which is strapped to the back of his bike. He is pouring with sweat as he makes his deliveries. 'There is no sanitation here, just so many complaints', he explains. 'So I thought: ""Let me get a water filter and supply clean water to these people, in order to help them and make some money""'. Prakash charges 10 rupees – not much more than 10 pence – per container. It is a price business owners can afford to pay; but as most in the neighbourhood make less than £1.50 a day, it is beyond the budget of the majority. And so, for most people in the area, simply getting clean water to drink is a struggle they face every day. India's government is not blind to the issue, and has long fought to provide enough clean drinking water for the masses. The figures, however, make worrying reading. The country has 18 percent of the world's population; but only 4 percent of the world's renewable water sources. And demand is growing. What is more, there are major problems with leaks and pollution, which strip away the supply even further. Mother of six Shazadi, pictured cleaning dishes outside her home, has to carry heavy buckets to and from the neighbourhood spigot to get water . T.M. Vijay Bhaskar, an official with India's department of drinking water and sanitation, says rural India faces a whole range of issues that are depleting its water. 'Because rural drinking water is dependent on ground water, ground water levels are going down because of exploitation by irrigation, by farmers and by industries, we are forced to drill deeper and deeper for drinking water,' he told CNN. 'And as we go deeper and deeper we find more and more contaminants. It may be arsenic. It may be fluoride. Now we are finding nitrate, iron, and salinity. Uranium is also involved in some places,' he said. India has set a national river conservation plan in place, which it hopes will reduce the pollution in its rivers. The plan includes interception, diversion and treatment of sewage, as well as low-cost sanitation works on riverbanks, and electric or improved wood crematoria for funerals. But authorities concede that India is facing what they call 'water stress' because of urbanisation, industrialisation and the ever-rising population. Some people have installed illegal ground water pumps to avoid queuing with buckets at neighbourhood water taps in New Delhi . According to the 2011 census, India’s per . capita water availability stands at 1,545 cubic meters, down from 1,816 . cubic meters in the 2001 population count. This year an acute water . shortage hit New Delhi. The city relies on other states for much of its . water supply, but now it is finding itself in a tug of war to get it . because those other states are dealing with shortages too. While this fight goes on, entire neighbourhoods across New Delhi rely on trucks to bring in the only water supply. Thirsty crowds emerge as soon as the truck becomes visible. Mother Bimla fills as large a bucket as possible, because the truck only comes to her area three times a week. Underneath the water truck children squat with little buckets, which they use to collect the drops of water spilling from the undercarriage. 'At times there are scuffles and we have to return empty handed,' says Bimla. When every drop of water matters, the fight for it is ultimately a fight for survival. For India, and its capital city, it is a fight they simply have to win.","A New Delhi neighbourhood provides a snapshot of the 'growing crisis' facing the Indian city, where water is becoming harder to come by .
A single tap - which the government turns on just three times a day - is shared by around 100,000 people in one area of India's capital .
Families report high levels of sickness among children forced to drink contaminated water because of the lack of sanitation .
India has 18 per cent of the world's population; but just four per cent of the world's renewable water sources ."
"The two firms say they have reached agreement on a cash and shares offer which gives investors a 50% premium on BG Group's share price on 7 April.
The deal could be one of the biggest of 2015 and could produce a company with a value of more than £200bn ($296bn).
BG Group's shares opened up 42% on the London Stock Exchange at 1,293.5p.
Shell's £177bn market capitalisation dwarfs that of BG, which now stands at £31bn after a 20% fall in its share price over the past year.
BG Group is the UK's third largest energy company, and currently employs about 5,200 people in 24 countries.
It was created in 1997 when British Gas demerged into two separate companies: BG and Centrica.
BG took control of exploration and production while Centrica took charge of the UK retail business of the former British Gas.
In 2000, BG split into BG Group and Lattice Group.
Shell said BG Group shareholders would enjoy higher dividends, as it confirmed its intention to pay its existing shareholders $1.88 per ordinary share this year.
That compares with a dividend of just $0.14 that BG Group shareholders can expect to receive this year.
The oil giant also said it expected to commence a share buyback programme in 2017 of at least $25bn.
Shell said it would also provide BG Group shareholders with a ""mix and match facility"", allowing them to vary how much they receive in cash and new Shell shares.
Shell and BG Group expect to make annual savings of $2.5bn following the deal.
But Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said he remained committed to North Sea oil and expected to invest £4bn between 2016 and 2018.
Shell said the deal would also add 25% to its proven oil and gas reserves and 20% to production capacity, particularly in Australia's liquid natural gas (LNG) market and in deep water oil exploration off the Brazilian coast.
BG Group shareholders will own approximately 19% of the combined group following the deal.
The deal comes at a time of uncertainty for oil and gas companies. In the past six months the price of oil has fallen by about 50%. Meanwhile, analysts have warned that investment in North Sea oil exploration has all but dried up, threatening the entire industry.
Last month, the Chancellor, George Osborne, lowered the supplementary corporation tax levied against oil companies that operate in the North Sea.
BG Group warned in February that it would write down the value of its oil and gas assets by nearly £6bn ($9bn) due to the oil price slump.
Similarly, Shell announced in January that it would be cutting spending by nearly £10bn over the next three years.
As it announced the takeover bid, Shell said it expected to make asset sales totalling $30bn between 2016 and 2018, although it did not specify which assets it was reviewing for sale.
Asked about potential job losses in the North Sea, Shell and BG Group said they expected there to be ""global synergies"", while adding that if the deal had not happened, they might both have had to make job cuts.
Current BG Group chief executive Helge Lund, who took up the post last month, will remain with BG Group while the deal goes through, but is expected to leave once it is completed.
BG Group chairman Andrew Gould said the BG board remained confident in the energy firm's long-term prospects under Mr Lund, but that Shell's offer ""allows us to accelerate and de-risk the delivery of this value"".
Even so, the payout that Mr Lund is likely to receive, alongside the boost he will receive to his income from his BG Group shareholdings, could raise eyebrows.
In December, BG's board revised Mr Lund's proposed £12m upfront shares bonus, after shareholders and the Institute of Directors complained.
Analysts gave a mixed reaction to news of the deal. Investec analyst Neil Morton said a tie-up had ""been mooted for about 20 years"".
He added: ""BG investors receive what we see as a compelling offer. For Shell shareholders, we are less convinced of the merits.
""The deal is predicated on a strong recovery in oil prices ($90 per barrel from 2018), while we suspect that Shell is pouncing on BG's imminent free cash flow to protect its burdensome dividend payout.""
Christian Stadler associate professor of strategic management at Warwick Business School said BG would fit well with Shell's portfolio.
""Shell has a very good track record in offshore oil and gas fields, and BG will help them solidify this area,"" he said.
He added acquiring BG would help Shell's replacement ratio: the amount of oil fields Shell has lined up to replace the oil it is currently producing.
But he warned cost savings would be hard to achieve and ""with the current downsizing in the oil industry you would expect some job losses"".",Royal Dutch Shell says it has agreed to buy oil and gas exploration firm BG Group in a deal that values the business at £47bn.
"Jhon Jairo Velasquez, nicknamed Popeye, was the top hit man of late Colombian drug baron Pablo Escobar.
He confessed to killing 300 people and also claimed a hand in up to 3,000 killings in the 1980s and 1990s.
But he also gave evidence against an ex-justice minister convicted of ordering the killing of a rival.
Velasquez, 52, walked free from the Combita high-security prison on Tuesday to start a probation period of four years.
He left under heavy police escort, a sign of the risks he believes he will face outside jail.
The BBC's Arturo Wallace in Bogota says Colombia is divided over his early release.
Several victims insist he still hasn't paid for all his crimes, while others say that after two decades in jail it is time to give him a second chance, our correspondent says.
Velasquez was convicted for his part in the murder of presidential hopeful Luis Carlos Galan in 1989.
But he later turned state's witness against former Justice Minister Alberto Santofimio, a rival candidate in the 1990 presidential election, who was convicted of ordering Mr Galan's killing.
Mr Galan had taken a hard line against powerful drug cartels and was favourite to win the election, but he was was shot dead in a town outside Bogota as he prepared to give a speech.

"Wolves' Kurt Gidley, 34, became the first rugby league player to wear a camera during Thursday's 22-8 defeat.
Television viewers were told at half-time that the device had been removed because of ""technical issues"".
""I don't know if it had any effect on what he did, but the camera went at half-time,"" said Wire coach Tony Smith.
""Kurt wanted to get on with playing footy. I don't think things were going great for Kurt at that stage. He needed to get it off and just get on with playing.""
The camera, which was mounted on a vest behind a hole in Gidley's shirt, was worn to try to give viewers a unique perspective of the contact sport.
Gidley had said before kick-off that the experimental idea ""painted a target"" on him.
Wolves are bottom of Super League and without a win after five successive defeats, but Smith said the technology could not be used as an excuse.
""I hope they got some good footage from it,"" he added. ""I think it was done for all the right reasons to try and give people a perspective of rugby league from a different angle.""
Sky Sports, who broadcast live Super League, have said they will continue with the experiment.
""We had a few technical issues with the camera which could not be resolved in the half-time break,"" a spokesperson said.
""Kurt was happy to continue wearing it and it was a decision made by our production team and Warrington, not his, to take it off.

"The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation brought in $144.4 million in 2013, a three-fold growth from the $51.5 million the foundation received in 2012, according to tax documents released on Wednesday. Though the group said in a statement the boost came from a consolidation with other charities under the foundation, the jump could also be seen as the foundation moving to up its endowment and put itself on better footing in case Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016. ""In 2013 the Foundation reconsolidated the Clinton Global Initiative into its operations,"" Andrew Kessel, the foundation's chief financial officer, wrote in a letter attached to the tax forms. ""As such, the 990 tax document shows a corresponding increase in both revenue and expenses."" According to the filing, nine donors collectively gave over $60 million. One donor gave $15 million, while three more gave around $10 million. The foundation does disclose a range of their donors online -- though they are not legally obligated to -- but the names of these donors are blacked out on the tax filing. ""In 2013, the Foundation expanded our work, reinforced our financial footing, and became better positioned to maximize our impact for years to come,"" Kessel said. ""Our tax statements reflect these improvements."" While revenue went up, so did expenses. Nearly 10% -- or $8.1 million -- of the foundation's $84.6 million in expenses was spent on travel. The only categories with higher expenses were salaries and wages and ""conferences, conventions and meetings."" And now at least one conservative group, America Rising PAC, is calling on Clinton to detail the foundation's expenses to reveal whether the Clintons' politically-related travel during the 2014 midterms was funded by the nonprofit organization. ""We are calling on the Foundation to release details of how their travel and fundraising budget was spent so voters know the extent to which the Clinton's use the charity to subsidize their lavish travel, courtship of potential 2016 donors, and political schedule,"" the PAC's executive director Tim Miller said in an email. Early in 2013, just shortly after Hillary Clinton left her post as America's top diplomat, the foundation that was once simply known as the William J. Clinton Foundation was renamed to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Hillary Clinton has been very visible at the foundation's events. She led a number of sessions at the group's annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting in New York this year and just last week led a session at a foundation event in Little Rock. Since leaving the State Department, Clinton has stepped up her role in fundraising for the foundation, too. When Clinton served as secretary of state, the foundation pledged to disclose their donors and stopped holding events overseas in order to avoid conflict of interest claims between her role and the foundations. With Clinton eying another run at the presidency, a spokesman for the foundation said earlier this year that should Clinton run for president, the ""precedent"" of what the foundation did while she served as secretary of state would serve as a guide to how they would handle her run .","The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation had a three-fold growth in contributions from 2012 to 2013 .

"Best-selling children's book The Elf On The Shelf is a disturbing cultural phenomenon which instills in young children the idea that a surveillance state is perfectly acceptable, claims a university professor. Laura Pinto, a digital technology professor at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, has published a paper in which she argues that the elf has a very sinister undertow. In her recently published paper, Who's The Boss, she claims that the idea of the elf reporting back to Santa each night on the child's behavior 'sets up children for dangerous, uncritical acceptance of power structures.' Professor Laura Pinto believes that the idea of an elf reporting back to Santa each night on a child's behavior 'sets up children for dangerous, uncritical acceptance of power structures' Since it was first published in 2005, The Elf On The Shelf has quickly become an integral part of modern Christmas celebrations. It has sold over six million copies and in 2013 was included as a float in the Macy's Thanksgiving parade for the first time. The story describes how Santa's 'scout elves' hide in people's homes to watch over events. Once everyone goes to bed, the scout elf then flies back to the North Pole to report to Santa the activities - both 'naughty' and 'nice' - that have taken place throughout the day. Before the family wakes up each morning, the scout elf flies back from the North Pole and hides. By hiding in a new spot each morning around the house, the scout elf and the family play an on-going game of hide and seek. Pinto has called the elf 'an external form of non-familial surveillance,' and says it is potentially conditioning children to accept state surveillance too. Since it was first published in 2005, The Elf On The Shelf has sold over 6 million copies and in 2013 it was included as a float in the Macy's Thanksgiving parade for the first time . 'If you grow up thinking it's cool for the elves to watch me and report back to Santa, well, then it's cool for the NSA to watch me and report back to the government,' she told Inside Halton. Pinto isn't the first person to criticize and question the message that The Elf On The Shelf teaches kids. Atlantic columnist Kate Tuttle called it 'a marketing juggernaut dressed up as a ""tradition""', and its purpose 'to spy on kids' as inappropriate for the holiday season. Washington Post reviewer Hank Stuever characterized the concept as 'just another nannycam in a nanny state obsessed with penal codes.' Writing for Psychology Today, Dr. David Kyle Johnston called it a 'dangerous parental crutch', with much the same reasoning as what he terms the 'Santa lie.' The best-selling book was written and self-published by American author Carol Aebersold and her daughter Chanda Bell . In her paper, Pinto also argues that the book teaches children to potentially cater to The Elf On The Shelf as the 'other,' rather than engaging in and honing understandings of social relationships with peers, parents, teachers and 'real life' others. 'You're teaching (kids) a bigger lesson, which is that it's OK for other people to spy on you and you're not entitled to privacy,' she tells the Toronto Star.","The best-selling children's book tells the story of an elf reporting back to Santa each night on a child's behavior .

"(CNN) -- There's a whole world of people out there, and boy, are they pissed off. The anonymity of the Internet encourages online ranting, from election-season tirades to mockery of celebrities. On political blogs, the invective flies. Posters respond to the latest celebrity gossip with mockery or worse. Sports fans set up Web sites with names that begin with ""fire,"" hoping coaches, athletic directors and sportscasters lose their jobs. And though there are any number of bloggers and commenters who attempt to keep their postings and responses on a civil level, all too often interactive Web sites descend into ad hominem attacks, insults and plain old name-calling. Indeed, there are even whole sites devoted to venting, such as justrage.com (one screed there was titled, ""I don't give a flying f***, so f*** you"") and mybiggestcomplaint.com. This is not a world Emily Post would want to be caught in after dark. ""The Internet can be a great tool,"" said Sara Black, a professor of health studies at St. Joseph's University who takes a particular interest in online bullying. ""Like any tool, it can also be misused.""  See examples of Internet anger » . One reason for the vitriol that emerges on the Web, experts say, is the anonymity the Internet provides. Commenters seldom use their real names, and even if they do, the chance for retaliation is slim. ""In the [pre-Internet era], you had to take ownership [of your remarks]. Now there's a perception of anonymity,"" said Lesley Withers, a professor of communication at Central Michigan University. ""People think what they say won't have repercussions, and they don't think they have to soften their comments."" Contrast that with a face-to-face conversation, or even a phone conversation, where you can judge people's moods from facial movements or vocal inflections, observes University of Texas psychology professor Art Markman. iReport.com: Second Life avatars grapple with reduced nonverbal communication . ""It's hard to be aggressive when you're face to face,"" he said. Moreover, he points out, aggression often carries a subtext of power. ""A lot of times, real anger is an attempt to get control over a situation where the person doesn't usually have it,"" he said. In that respect, comments to blog posts are attempts to strike back. Those power games are innately grasped by children and teens, with schools serving as a perennial social laboratory. Cheryl Dellasega, a Penn State women's studies professor, ticks off hypothetical examples that could have come straight from the scripts to ""Mean Girls"" or ""Heathers."" ""Girls who are getting teased come home and let their [aggressors] have it by putting something on their blog and starting a rumor campaign,"" she said. And instead of rumors simply making the rounds among peer groups -- which can be bad enough -- ""they go out to a much bigger group, a worldwide group. The impact is devastating, and it's as easy as clicking a button."" ""Kids don't realize that one post can destroy somebody's life forever,"" she added. Indeed, such incidents have made headlines. In 2006, 13-year-old Megan Meier committed suicide after becoming attracted to a boy on MySpace who then turned on her. The boy turned out to be a hoax created by a neighbor family that included a former friend of Meier's. In August, The New York Times Magazine did a story about trolls, some barely out of their teens, who antagonize others for the sake of ""lulz"": ""Lulz is watching someone lose their mind at their computer 2,000 miles away while you chat with friends and laugh,"" one ex-troll told the publication. Adults aren't immune by any means. A Japanese woman, angry at her online ""husband,"" killed his avatar after he divorced her. A South Korean actress committed suicide after being harassed by online rumors following a divorce. Celebrity gossip sites are full of snarky comments about stars; reaction from readers is often brutal, turning the story into the online equivalent of a pile-on. Markman is quick to observe that he doesn't believe there's more anger out there. But, he said, ""there are more ways of expressing it on the Internet."" ""We've all had interactions with unpleasant people, but we don't confront them. We take it out elsewhere,"" he said. ""What the Internet has created is groups of people where there are no repercussions with being too aggressive."" Indeed, though electronically transmitted anger has parallels throughout human history -- the bitter letter, the village gossip -- the speed at which it travels, and the number of people who may come in contact with it, is something new, says St. Joseph's Black. ""[Electronic] media can increase potential for violence in a number of ways,"" she said in an e-mail interview. ""First, it introduces ideas (good and bad) that people may not have come up with on their own. Second, it is easier to depersonalize the victim, facilitating perpetration. Third, aggressive behaviors may be reinforced with points, attention or status, especially in games."" Withers has seen that first hand. She teaches a course on the ""dark side of communication"" at Central Michigan, involving ""the mean or evil things we do on a day-to-day basis,"" as she describes it: cheating, for example, or lying. As part of the course, several of her students work on a collaborative project with students at other schools, and they come together in Second Life, the virtual reality environment. If someone isn't pulling his or her weight, says Withers, others can be harsh in their judgments -- harsher than in real life, because the anger is expressed at the person's avatar. Sidebar: Dealing with anger in Second Life . Which led at least one of Withers' students to forget that the avatar was attached to a real person. ""One student went off on another student and she was sitting in the classroom a few rows behind him,"" she said. ""He knew she was there, but didn't -- there was that distancing."" iReport.com: Residents of virtual worlds deal with drama, stress . Is there a way to restore civility to the Internet? Among children and teenagers, say Dellasega and Black, it's up to parents to exercise control. ""I think parents need to take responsibility,"" Dellasega said. ""They give kids computers and leave them alone. ... When a child is 8 or 9, the computer should be in a public place. Kids should understand that using a computer is a privilege, not a right."" Schools can also play a role, she says. Black adds that parents should set clear rules on behavior and build empathy in their kids by having them reach out to those who are different. As for adults, human nature dictates that people will always lash out at others, whether it's over a perceived insult or simply because of a power differential. Web sites may ban the worst offenders, but they'll almost always pop up elsewhere, using a different name, e-mail address or even computer. ""Some people are just bitter and angry,"" said psychiatrist Dr. Terry Eagan, medical director of the Moonview Sanctuary in Santa Monica, California. ""Sometimes, they're against everyone, other times against a specific group. That person can get really stimulated and can say all sorts of horrible things. But I don't think it's not like they didn't exist before."" Whether the problem will get control of us, or we will get control of the problem, is in the way we face up to it, he says. Anger, he says, is rolled up with anxiety and fear, and nothing creates more fear like a lack of understanding. ""I tell patients that I'd rather know everything about people; information is powerful,"" he said. ""When the climate of the world is more fear-based, it permeates everything.""","Blogs, commenters and whole Web sites are full of vitriol .

Visitors to Recovery.gov are greeted with a video message from President Obama. The site, Recovery.gov, allows visitors to track efforts to jump-start a teetering economy in the midst of a slumping housing market and massive job losses. It breaks down the $787 billion package by category: $288 billion for tax relief, $59 billion for health care, and so on.

Using graphs, charts and layman's terminology, the online portal is an example of how the tech-savvy Obama administration is taking its message to the American people. While running for president, Obama harnessed the Web's fundraising and social-networking capabilities to energize his grass-roots campaign. And the moment he was sworn in as the 44th president of the United States, administration officials unveiled a sleek interactive version of Whitehouse.gov, the official White House Web site. Recovery.gov, launched within hours of Obama's signing of the stimulus bill Tuesday, continues the theme of offering information in a user-friendly format. Visitors are greeted by a brief video address from Obama. ""The American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan represents a strategic and significant investment in our country's future,"" the president explains. ""The size and scale of this plan demand unprecedented efforts to root out waste, inefficiency and unnecessary spending. Recovery.gov will be the online portal for these efforts."" The site will publish information on how the stimulus funds will be spent in a ""timely, targeted and transparent manner,"" Obama said. Edward Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard University, said transparency has ""been a watch word for good government types for years."" ""There is sense that taxpayers will feel a lot better about this if they actually know where their money is going,"" Glaeser said. ""Better transparency makes evaluation much easier."" Glaeser pointed out that the idea behind Recovery.gov is not entirely new. He noted that the Office of Management and Budget has for years had a site where citizens can learn the available cost-benefit information of several government programs. Clicking on ""Where is Your Money Going"" on the new site brings up a chart displaying key areas where the $787 billion will be distributed, including tax relief, energy, health care and infrastructure and science. Under ""Accountability and Transparency,"" there is a statement that reads, ""This is your money. You have a right to know where it's going and how it's being spent. Learn what steps we're taking to ensure you can track our progress every step of the way."" Like other Obama online portals, the site encourages user interaction. The public is invited to share stories on how the Recovery Act is affecting them. Scrolling over a map of the United States reveals data on the number of jobs created and saved in each state. Those with some time on their hands can also read, in its entirety, the full text of the legislation.","New White House Web site explains economic stimulus spending .

"An oil tycoon has been ordered to pay nearly $1 billion in a divorce settlement to his wife, making it one of the biggest payouts in history. Continental Resources CEO Harold Hamm was ordered by an Oklahoma County judge to hand over close to $1 billion to his ex-wife Sue Ann Hamm, according to a court filing made public on Monday. Special Judge Howard Haralson found that Hamm, 68, should pay Mrs Hamm a total of $995.5 million, with about a third of the funds, or $322.7 million, to be paid by the end of the year, the filing revealed. Harold Hamm was ordered by an Oklahoma County judge to hand over close to $1 billion to his ex-wife Sue Ann Hamm (pictured), according to court filings released on Monday . Forbes named the oil tycoon the 30th richest person in the U.S. in 2012 and 76th richest person in the world. His fortune is estimated at $14billion today . Hamm will then be required to pay the rest of the judgment, some $650 million, in installments worth at least $7 million per month. Sue Ann Hamm has already been awarded around $25 million since the case was filed in 2012. To secure the judgment, Judge Haralson has placed a lien on 20 million shares of Continental stock. The ruling, which is subject to appeal, comes after a ten-week divorce trial which ended last month. Hamm started Continental in 1967, and about 68 per cent of the firm's shares are in his name. His stake was worth more than $18 billion when the trial started in August. It's worth around $14 billion today. Since the couple wed in 1988, Continental has grown from a small-time driller worth less than $50 million into a $20 billion behemoth and one of Oklahoma's largest companies. Because Harold owned his shares before he and Sue Ann were married, they belong to him. But under Oklahoma law, their 'active' appreciation since 1988 is subject to 'equitable distribution' with Sue Ann, a former executive at Continental who filed for divorce from Harold in 2012. Her legal team contends that the amount of marital wealth the court should divide is more than $17 billion, a sum that included most of Harold's stake in Continental a few months before the trial began. In a court filing from 2013, Mrs Hamm alleged that her husband was having an affair, which prompted her to file for divorce. Mrs Hamm, 56, has held key posts at Continental, but she no longer works for the company. Court filings showed that his attorneys argued that the couple's shared wealth is a tiny fraction of that amount. The couple never signed a prenuptial agreement. Harold Hamm's leadership at Continental is central to the case. The Hamms own four houses together including this vast property in an exclusive enclave of Nichols Hills, Oklahoma . High-life: Sue Ann Hamm and the couple's daughter Jane are pictured at a lunch for the Wall Street Journal Innovator of Year award . In court, his lawyers attributed most of Continental's success not to Hamm's business savvy but to factors beyond his control - that market factors such as rising oil prices, or decisions made prior to marriage caused Continental's growth. The trial ended on October 9. This is the second divorce for Hamm after he divorced his first wife, Judith Ann, in 1987. They have three children together. In 1988, Hamm married Sue Ann, an economist and lawyer. The couple had two daughters, Jane and Hillary. The oil magnate lives in Oklahoma City and owns homes in Enid, Oklahoma and Nichols Hills, Oklahoma. The vast Nichols Hills property is believed to be worth in the region of $3million.

Forbes named him the 30th richest person in the U.S. in 2012 and 76th richest person in the world. He had humble beginnings, growing up in rural Oklahoma where he was the 13th child of Oklahoma cotton sharecroppers. Mr Hamm spent his youth picking cotton, before starting his career at 20 by scrubbing the scum out of oil barrels. He worked his way up and was eventually able to drill his own wells. Fond of eating at burger bars, Mr Hamm has a reputation for being down-to-earth and drives his own truck. His big breakthrough came in the Nineties, when he helped discover the Bakken field of North Dakota, the largest new US oil prospect since the Sixties. Mr Hamm is a staunch Republican and donated close to a million dollars to Mitt Romney's presidential bid in 2012.

"Frustrated holidaymakers faced long delays at airports yesterday on the first full day of increased security checks. Queues stretched outside the terminal doors at one airport because of the crackdown – brought in amid fears Al Qaeda has developed a ‘stealth bomb’ undetectable to scanners. Air passengers around the country were subjected to ‘vigorous’ body searches, with their shoes removed and swabbed for traces of explosives. Gatwick: Travellers faced delays getting inside the terminal building after the security crackdown . Queues at Manchester Airport this morning, the day after new security checks were brought in to search for so-called 'stealth bombs' which are feared to be undetectable to airport scanners . Passengers joined queues starting outside Manchester airport today, with many complaining of delays . They were also told to switch on their tablets, smartphones and laptops to prove they are not hiding something more sinister. Some customers said it took them 90 minutes just to get through security – and holidaymakers have now been warned to allow for least three hours before their flight time. Angry travellers branded the delays an ‘absolute joke’ and ‘like wading through treacle’. Airline chiefs are braced for further problems as one of the busiest weekends of the summer gets underway. The checks have been brought in due to fears that Al Qaeda’s top bomb-maker Ibrahim Al-Asiri has developed a non-metallic ‘stealth bomb’ that can be hidden inside human bodies or other devices. The use of body scanners, swabs and patting down have all been increased at UK airports while some bags are being searched twice. Passengers are removing shoes and belts as a matter of course, while those on US-bound flights are likely to face further screening and searches of bags at the boarding gates. The alert has sparked fears of a summer of travel chaos with holidaymakers facing invasive personal checks and long delays. Heathrow alone handles more than 190,000 passengers a day and across the country 24million people will fly abroad before September – 3million to the US. A spokesman for travel industry body ABTA said: ‘The main thing is to make sure that airports have sufficient measures in place to ensure all the available security gates are open.’ At Manchester Airport, officials said problems were made worse by many travellers arriving earlier than normal because of the extra checks. Some complained they were left standing outside the terminal building before they could even check in. Sam Lavelle posted pictures of fellow passengers queuing in the drop-off zone outside Terminal One, writing: ‘The queue is literally outside the door and onto the road.’ Elissa Corrigan described the wait as ‘soul destroying’. And Ian Moreno-Melgar, who was heading to Belfast for a wedding, tweeted: ‘Queuing in the car park for security isn’t normal.’ But at Heathrow passengers appeared resigned to longer and more intrusive searches as they were subjected to what one termed ‘American-style security’. Passengers wait at Heathrow Airport this morning as security staff carry out more stringent security checks . Queues to get to security at Glasgow Airport, where passengers complained of waiting times today . Christian Radnedge, who was flying to Houston, said: ‘Everyone is taking their shoes off, there are pat-downs on almost everyone after being screened, a few people are having their bags tested.’ A traveller flying to California said it was a price worth paying for ‘staying safe in a dangerous world’. And Paul Kenyon, 59, of Poynton, Cheshire, who was on his way to Bologna, said: ‘They were looking at Apple computer equipment closely and they took my washbag through the machine a couple of times as I had my contact lenses in liquid inside. ‘Nobody was moaning about the extra time and it’s not that much of a hassle. As long as you leave yourself plenty of time then you’ll get on your flight.’ Last night, traveller Matteo Pescarin posted a photo of a crammed North Terminal at Gatwick Airport as hundreds of passengers queued to go through security. Taking the chaos with good humour, David Silvester tweeted: ‘Just had my croissants x-rayed and then inspected...’ At Glasgow Airport, passengers also faced waits. Norma Decent, 59, from Stranraer, said: ‘I understand why they’re doing it, but it all seems a little excessive to me.’ Laura Macpherson, 42, from Paisley, added: ‘It’s better to be safe than sorry.’ Don't go to Syria, imams urge young Britons . Muslim leaders yesterday launched an unprecedented appeal to would-be young British jihadists: Don’t travel to fight in Syria and Iraq. Some 100 imams asked the UK’s Muslim community to help prevent radicalised youngsters joining militants abroad. Muslims should continue the ‘generous and tireless’ support for those caught up in the bloodshed – but from the UK in a ‘safe and responsible way’, they said. Chilling: British jihadists in a recruitment video aimed at youngsters in the UK . The call was made by leaders from different Islamic theological backgrounds and was echoed by imams during Friday prayers. It came as claims emerged yesterday that up to three Al Qaeda instructors tutored by master bomb-maker Ibrahim Al-Asiri are believed to have slipped in to Syria to teach British and other Europeans jihadists to make ‘stealth bombs’. And a British man who claims he has been fighting in Syria told the BBC he will not return to the UK until he can raise ‘the black flag of Islam’ over Downing Street and Buckingham Palace. Speaking with a northern accent, the man, who called himself Abu Osama, said he had received military training, making bombs and fighting with the extremist Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al Qaeda. He claimed to have been fighting for the establishment of a caliphate – which he referred to by the Arabic term Khilafah – across the Islamic world. ‘There is nothing in Britain – it is just pure evil,’ he said. ‘If and when I come back to Britain it will be when this Khilafah – this Islamic state – comes to conquer Britain and I come to raise the black flag of Islam over Downing Street, over Buckingham Palace, over Tower Bridge and over Big Ben. I don’t want to come back to what I have left behind.’ Osama said he initially faced opposition from his family but they now ‘understand that this is a good cause I am in’. It emerged yesterday that there are already believed to be three Al Qaeda instructors trained in bomb-making in Syria. It is feared they are poised to tutor young British Muslims who have travelled there in the art of making ‘invisible bombs’ – non-metallic devices that can get past airport scanners and can even be stitched inside a suicide bomber’s body. Security officers are said to have identified more than 100 of the 600 Britons currently fighting in Syria while US investigators have given their UK counterparts ‘dozens of names of interest’. However the US, which has demanded increased security at British airports, also accused the UK of ignoring for too long the threat posed by men like Osama. Frank Gaffney, former assistant secretary of defence under Ronald Reagan, said British governments ‘turned a blind eye’ to recruitment operations and ‘embraced extremists’. He said of the Western jihadists in Iraq and Syria: ‘What they learn there are the skill sets to bring violence to us.’ US officials say iPhones (left) and Samsung Galaxy phones (right) could be subject to greater checks .

"By . Steve Nolan . PUBLISHED: . 04:03 EST, 7 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:58 EST, 7 February 2013 . Sentenced: Carer Angela Perkins was jailed for two years after admitting stealing £100,000 from a 90-year-old dementia sufferer . A carer who stole £100,000 from a 90-year-old dementia patient has been jailed for two years. Angela Perkins siphoned money from the vulnerable patient's life savings between 2005 and 2010. Perkins, from Norwich, in Norfolk, helped patients to do their shopping and had access to the woman's PIN and bank accounts. She had originally been charged with stealing £55,000 from the woman in July last year, but it was later discovered that she had stolen almost double that amount. The 47-year-old was handed a two year prison sentence at Norwich Crown Court after admitting the theft at a previous hearing. The victim is in 24-hour residential care. Det Con Huw Caine, of Norfolk Police, said after the sentencing: 'The actions of Perkins left the victim confused, upset and extremely traumatised with worry due to the fact her savings had dwindled away and she didn't have any money left in her account. 'Perkins exploited the fact the victim was vulnerable and removed money from the victim's account for her own use, abusing her position of trust. 'When Perkins was challenged in interview about accounting for cash withdrawals from the victim's account that corresponded with deposits into her own account she was unable to give any satisfactory answers.' He added: 'The case highlights that offences of this nature and the targeting of some of our most vulnerable people in society will not be tolerated. 'I hope that the results of this case highlight to other potential offenders how robustly Norfolk Constabulary will investigate and deal with such incidents.' Norfolk Police said it was now trying to confiscate money from Perkins under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Should a confiscation order be served and Perkins fail to pay up, she could face an additional sentence.

"A stunning start saw tries from Peceli Yato and David Strettle help Clermont into an early 15-0 lead.
Four penalties from Johnny Sexton then cut the gap to three but a Morgan Parra penalty and Camille Lopez drop-goal seemed to have won it.
Garry Ringrose's score cut the gap to two but Lopez's boot saw Clermont home.
Clermont - two-time finalists but yet to win the tournament - will meet Saracens in Edinburgh on Saturday, 13 May.
Clermont are the nearly men of French rugby, having lost to Toulon in Europe's top club tournament in the 2013 and 2015 finals, and won only one of their 12 French finals - and that at the 11th attempt.
But they started as a side used to the biggest stages, and their early pressure brought them deserved tries from the impressive Fiji flanker Yato and livewire former England winger Strettle.
Both sides are attack-minded but Leinster were struggling to get hold of the ball and it was not until the end of the half they finally enjoyed some pressure of their own.
Ireland fly-half Sexton got them on the board with the last kick of a half in which they had been totally outplayed.
Leinster needed to start the second half the better and duly attacked from deep on their first possession.
They proceeded to come at Clermont from every angle, with three quick penalties enabling Sexton to cut the gap to only three points.
Then came the decisive moment of the game.
The supporting Dan Leavy thought he had scored for Leinster, but the television match official had noticed an infringement back at the start of the move.
His eagle eyes spotted that flanker Leavy himself had held on to Aurelien Rougerie at a ruck to open the gap Leinster had first streamed through 60 metres back upfield.
Not only did Leinster have the try struck off but they also conceded a penalty, which Parra stroked over to put Clermont further ahead.
Lopez banged over a drop-goal from distance to put Clermont more than seven points clear, only for Ireland centre Ringrose to score a fine converted try and cut the gap to two points.
But the outstanding Fritz Lee won the latest in a series penalties at a ruck to halt a Leinster attack and Lopez's accurate boot did the rest to send Clermont into the final.
Leinster fly-half Johnny Sexton:
""I felt that we could still win it at half-time. We should have made them work harder for their scores - they got a 15-point head-start.
""We were beaten by an impressive side, who have been impressive all year. We have to take our hats off and say they were better than us.""
Clermont's ex-England & Saracens wing David Strettle:
""We always knew they would have a purple patch. We had to start well, hold on when they got on top after half-time and then finish strongly.
""I think Saracens have got better since I left, but I can see in the two years that I have been here how important this tournament is to the club.""

Poppy says: 'I remember thinking she was very beautiful, almost cat-like, but definitely a bit of a bloke.

At 4:00 a.m., rummaging through bushes for our stray couture, I realized it wasn’t just another friendship,' says Poppy. The fashionista friends are lucky enough to have toured the world together, for work and fun, but of the two Poppy maintains that it is Alexa who has the most amazing stories: 'I love living vicariously through tales of her love life. That was one of the reasons for inviting her on this trip – we’re boy-crazy. James (Poppy's new husband) knows I’m boy-crazy and always will be, but Alexa is really boy-crazy. 'What else?

'And I knew she was going to be brilliant, so I had to become very aware of not comparing. 'I don’t understand women who don’t encourage each other.

"Younes Tsouli, 31, was jailed for 16 years in 2007 for distributing bomb-making instructions and has used Human Rights Act to appeal against deportation . A jailed terrorist who wrote a letter from a British prison proclaiming jihadis as ‘heroes’ is trying to avoid deportation from the UK on human rights grounds. Internet jihadi Younes Tsouli, 31 – who was once described as Al Qaeda’s most influential cyber-terrorist – was jailed for 16 years in 2007 for distributing bomb-making instructions as well as beheading videos on the internet. Tsouli, who called himself ‘Terrorist007’, was posting the material for Al Qaeda in Iraq. His prison term came to an end last November, but he was re-arrested and detained ahead of his release as prison officials found a copy of an Al Qaeda magazine in his cell. A hearing at the Old Bailey last week cleared Tsouli of unlawfully possessing the material, and he was due to be deported immediately back to his native Morocco. But he has appealed against his deportation on human rights grounds, applying for asylum to the UK under Article 2 of the Human Rights Act, which states no one should be subjected to ‘torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’. It is believed that Tsouli had been active in the global cyber-jihadi scene since he moved to the UK to study IT at a London college in 2001. The cyber-terrorist used to hack into respectable websites and use them as hosts for videos including the beheading of British hostage Ken Bigley and Americans Daniel Pearl and Nick Berg. Tsouli set up a website called YouBombIt which he described as a ‘platform just like YouTube to post videos of bombings of Coalition forces’ in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has set up another called DeadZionists, and was in the process of setting up a third called Islamic Terrorism, when police raided his basement flat in Shepherd’s Bush in 2005. His websites and forums were being used by jihadis across the world to communicate. In July last year, the prison authorities intercepted a letter Tsouli had written to his father in Arabic, where he urged his family to join the jihad in Syria. In it he wrote: ‘This is a letter of advice to those members of my family who will learn their lesson and I hope that they are among those whom Allah has opened their hearts to what is good.’ Uncovered: Prison officials at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire found the magazine inside Tsouli's cell . He quoted a saying of the Prophet Mohammed, which said: ‘Allah gives rewards to those who go out for jihad out of conviction and belief in Allah and his prophets. To those Allah will grant either victory or paradise.’ He also mentioned a recent religious ruling which was a ‘call to arms’ in Syria, adding: ‘Prepare for the war since its flames are rising.’ The letter was read out during last week’s hearing, where Tsouli was accused of possessing a copy of Inspire in his cell in September last year, two months after the letter was intercepted. The court heard the forensic tests done on the magazine had revealed that it passed around the prison, as fingerprints belonging to a number of terrorist inmates – including Abdullah Ahmed Ali, the leader of the gang that tried to blow up airliners over the Atlantic – were found on it. However, Tsouli was cleared as he argued the magazine formed part of legal material. He is being kept in detention while the Home Office fights his bid to stay. Tsouli was accused of possessing a copy of Al Qaeda magazine Inspire in his cell in September last year . Jihadi John killed four US and UK hostages on camera under ISIS regime . A British jihadi who once hacked into the personal details of Tony Blair has tried to sell the identity of Jihadi John to The Mail on Sunday for £3,000. Junaid Hussain, 20, was jailed for six months in 2012 after publishing the former Prime Minister’s address and National Insurance number on the internet. In a series of online conversations, he told the MoS he would give us Jihadi John’s name and old Twitter details, with which we would be able to uncover his identity. Hussain, from Birmingham, said he needed the money to buy a car to move his family around IS stronghold Raqqa in Syria. He also claimed Jihadi John, pictured, who killed four US and UK hostages on camera, was of Arab origin, was born a Muslim and has been in Syria ‘for ages’. The Mail on Sunday refused to pay the money, and Scotland Yard has been informed.","Younes Tsouli, 31, was jailed for 16 years for posting videos for Al Qaeda .

"BEIJING — Ten people were arrested in suspicion of killing and dismembering a wild panda and selling its meat, according to Chinese state television. 
  
 Police found the panda's skin, bones and 22 pounds of meat in a raid on a house in Yanjin, Yunnan province, in December, CCTV reported. 
  
 Two of the suspects are brothers who told police they were hunting for an animal that killed their goat. 
  
 On finding the creature in a tree, they shot at it and found the falling animal to be a giant panda. When the injured panda climbed another tree, they shot at it again, causing its death. 
  
 The account was confirmed to another Chinese journalist by the Yunnan Forestry Bureau. 
  
 DNA tests revealed the panda was an adult female, CCTV said.

 China Central Television said forest police in Yunnan province recovered panda skin, meat, bones and an internal organ from the poachers and vendors. If convicted, the suspects could be jailed for years. 
  
 Authorities told the official Xinhua News Agency that one suspect, identified by his family name of Wang, set up a trap after he found his sheep had been killed by wild animals in December. After he found the trap was broken and his brother spotted footprints of a wild animal, the two men tracked down the panda and killed it, according to the media report. 
  
 The men sold 35 kilograms of giant panda meat and its four paws for 4,800 yuan ($800) to one buyer, and that the parts were sold again to others, Xinhua said. 
  
 A recent census shows the wild panda population grew by 268 to a total of 1,864 in China since the last survey ending in 2003. 
  
 The World Wide Fund for Nature has said poaching, a traditional threat to wild pandas in China, has declined but economic development has become a major threat. Hydropower plants, roads, and mining projects disrupt the animal's natural habitat. 
  
 Still, Chinese officials say poaching rare animals and smuggling their parts remain a problem and that authorities are stepping up efforts to crack down on acts endangering rare animals. |||||","– There is now one less giant panda in the world. China Central Television reports that police have arrested 10 people suspected in the killing and dismemberment of a protected wild panda, including two brothers said to have been the ones who actually killed the animal. Acting on a tip, police in Yunnan province raided a home and found panda meat, bones, and fur. They say the brothers sold about 77 pounds of meat and all four of the animal's paws to one merchant for $800, who then sold the parts to other buyers, reports AP. The brothers told police they were hunting for a wild animal that had killed one of their goats, NBC News reports. After spotting what they claim they thought was merely ""a large animal"" in a tree, the brothers shot and injured the bear. Police say they then fatally shot the wounded female, despite knowing it was a panda. If convicted, the suspects—both the hunters and the merchants—could face years in prison. Only about 1,800 giant pandas exist in the wild, making the black market for them lucrative."
"(CNN) -- A victim in the sexual abuse case against Jerry Sandusky has sued Penn State University, saying he couldn't reach a settlement with the university over claims that the longtime assistant football coach abused him. The man, known only as ""Victim 9,"" is one of 10 victims who were part of the criminal trial, in which the Nittany Lions' former defensive coordinator was convicted on 45 counts of sexual abuse in June 2012. Since the trial, 26 men have settled claims with Penn State totaling $59.7 million in connection with the Sandusky scandal, the university announced last month. Sandusky, currently serving a 30- to 60-year sentence, has always maintained that he is innocent and wrongly convicted of abusing young boys he met through his charity, The Second Mile. Sandusky raises another appeal . Many of the victims were abused on Penn State's campus, and some even after two incidents allegedly were brought to the university's attention -- once in 1998 and again in 2001. Victim 9 was raped repeatedly starting in 2005 when he was 12 years old, and ending around the time that another victim's allegations finally started a police investigation into Sandusky's decades of abuse. ""By the time this boy was introduced to Sandusky on the Penn State Campus, the top administrators at Penn State knew that Sandusky was a sexual predator,"" the man's attorney, Stephen E. Raynes, said in a press release. ""It's now clear that Penn State enabled Sandusky to sexually abuse more than twenty other children before Sandusky preyed on this boy. Each of those tragic assaults provided Penn State with the opportunity to stop Sandusky, opportunities which Penn State squandered. We will learn through this lawsuit why that happened and what additional lessons Penn State should learn from this tragic episode in its history."" Penn State paying $59.7 million to settle Sandusky cases . Raynes said Victim 9 tried to negotiate a settlement with Penn State, but the university refused ""to compensate him adequately for what he needs and deserves."" Penn State's former president, vice president and athletic director are all awaiting trial on charges they lied to a grand jury, obstructed justice and failed to report allegations of abuse reported to them in 2001. The abuse scandal resulted in the dismissal, in November 2011, of legendary head coach Joe Paterno amid allegations that he failed to respond forcefully enough to reports of Sandusky's crimes. Paterno died just weeks later, on January 22, 2012, at age 85. Penn State has said a few other claims by Sandusky victims have not yet been settled. Investigators may take 2nd look at high school where Jerry Sandusky coached .","""Victim 9"" was one of 10 victims in the Jerry Sandusky sexual abuse case .

"By . Jenny Hope . PUBLISHED: . 19:06 EST, 6 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:07 EST, 7 February 2013 . Threat: Air pollution to trigger potentially fatal pre-eclampsia in expectant mothers, a study has found . Exposure to air pollution could trigger potentially fatal pre-eclampsia in pregnant women, researchers have warned. Women with asthma are particularly . vulnerable to the condition - marked by high blood pressure and fluid . retention - according to a new study. It blamed one in every 20 cases of pre-eclampsia on higher levels of ozone pollution in the air during the first three months of pregnancy, as well . as an increase in premature births. The rate would mean pollution was a factor in up to 2,000 cases of pre-eclampsia in the UK each year. As many as one in 20 first-time mothers develop pre-eclampsia, while . around 20 women die each year from conditions linked to high blood . pressure. It is thought to claim the lives of 600 babies a year. The only treatment is to deliver the baby early with an emergency Caesarean. The new study adds to evidence of a link between air pollution and . premature birth, with international research earlier this week showing . higher pollution levels raised the risk of low birth weight. The study looked at almost 121,000 births in Greater Stockholm, Sweden, between 1998 and 2006. It compared the records with national data on the prevalence of asthma . among the children’s mothers; and levels of the air pollutants ozone and . vehicle exhaust (nitrogen oxide) in the Stockholm area. In all, 4.4 per cent of the pregnancies resulted in a premature birth . and the prevalence of pre-eclampsia was 2.7 per cent, say findings . published in the online journal BMJ Open. There was no association between exposure to levels of vehicle exhaust . and complications of pregnancy, nor were any links found for any air . pollutants and babies that were underweight at birth. But there did seem to be a link between exposure to ozone levels during . the first three months of pregnancy and the risk of premature birth . before 37 weeks and pre-eclampsia. Each rose by four per cent for every 10 microgram per cubic metre . increase in ambient ozone during this period, says the analysis. Mothers with asthma were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born . prematurely and 10 per cent more likely to have pre-eclampsia than mums . without this condition. Vulnerable: Pregnant women with asthma were 10 per cent more likely to have pre-eclampsia than those without the condition . The effect of pollution on inflammation processes in the body may be a potential mechanism, say the Swedish researchers. Asthma is an inflammatory condition and ozone may therefore have . worsened respiratory symptoms and systemic inflammation, so accounting . for the larger increase in the risk of premature birth among the mums . with asthma, suggest the researchers. After taking account of various factors, they calculated that one in . every 20 (five per cent) cases of pre-eclampsia were linked to ozone . levels during early pregnancy. Lead researcher David Olsson, of the department of public health and . clinical medicine at Umea University, said the findings should lead to . improved monitoring of women with asthma during pregnancy. He said ‘It’s difficult to put into practice measures that will . effectively reduce the risk, but it shows the importance of ensuring . women’s asthma symptoms are under control during early pregnancy. They . need to use their medication to help counteract the possible health . effects of pollution. ‘The study increases the evidence suggesting we should strive to keep . reducing pollution levels to improve human health’ he added.","Pre-eclampsia can threaten the life of both mother and baby .

"A hair-loss medication reportedly tried by Wayne Rooney may cause prolonged and possibly irreversible impotence, scientists have claimed. The recent findings come after one patient bravely stepped forward to reveal the drug left him with no sex drive and even shrank his genitals. Kevin Malley, 30, was prescribed with the drug Propecia after he worried he could be losing his hair. He said he only planned to take the pill for a year. Concern: Men worried about losing their hair may consider treatments such as Propecia. However in the UK the drug label warns about possible 'persistent' sexual side effects . However, just five months after he started taking it in May 2011 he found he was completely impotent and his testes also became smaller. Worried, he consulted his doctor and was told the symptoms would disappear after he stopped taking the drug. But he says a year on and nothing has changed. It will come as no surprise to Dr Michael Irwig from the University of Washington. He recently published a study in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, that found the ingredient finasteride, which is found in Propecia, can cause persistent sexual dysfunction, including low sexual desire, erectile dysfunction and problems with orgasms. The male pattern baldness drug is manufactured by Merck and was approved by the FDA in 1997. While labeling on the medication in the U.S. currently warns about possible reversible sexual side effects, there is no reference to the effects being persistent, Dr Irwig said. However, other countries including the UK and Sweden do require medical companies to include the 'persistent risk' warning on the labeling. It was reported that Wayne Rooney started taking the medication in 2009 after he became sick of other footballer's jibes about his receding hairline. He has since had a hair transplant. Unfortunate side-effects? Wayne Rooney was reported to be taking Propecia in 2009. It has since been linked with impotence . Dr Irwig first became aware of the problems caused by finasteride several years ago when he encountered several men who reported they had developed sexual dysfunction while taking the medication. 'It’s been very frustrating for a lot of these men because they’ve sought care from medical professionals who have looked at the literature and have not seen a risk of persistent sexual dysfunction,' says Dr Irwig. 'So a lot of these patients have been told to see psychiatrists and psychologists and that it’s all in their head.' Dr Irwig then noticed that men had reported sexual dysfunction for months even after they stopped taking the medication. 'I came across a website called propeciahelp.com with more than 1,400 registered users - many young healthy men who developed the same sexual side effects from finasteride - and I discovered that nobody had published a series looking at these men - who they are, how long the sexual side effects lasted, what types.' Dr Irwig’s study included results from interviews with 71 men aged 21 to 46 years old to assess how long they took finasteride, the type and duration of sexual side effects and their sexual frequency before and after the medication. Dr Irwig discovered that 94 per cent developed low libido, 92 per cent developed erectile dysfunction and decreased arousal, and 69 per cent developed problems with orgasm. On average, the men used finasteride for approximately 28 months but experienced persistent sexual side effects for an average of 40 months, from the time they ceased taking the medication to the time of the interview. Dr Irwig also found that the average number of sexual episodes per month dropped after finasteride use. 'It turns out that almost all the men had multiple sexual function problems,' says Dr Irwig. 'Before finasteride use, the men experienced average sexual activity of approximately 26 episodes per month, but after use, it came down to approximately eight per month - an almost two-thirds reduction. 'Twenty per cent of patients I interviewed experienced persistent sexual dysfunction for more than five years, which makes me wonder if their persistent sexual dysfunction is permanent,' he adds. Controversial: Merck says no evidence has proved a causal relationship between Propecia and long-lasting sexual dysfunction . This was certainly Mr Malley's experience. He told Good Morning America: 'I kept expecting the side effects to go away, but they did not, they only got worse.' Mr Malley said before he took the drug he was engaged and worked as a public health researcher at a university in Las Vegas. After he developed symptoms his fiancee broke off the engagement and he said he had to resign from his job because of cognitive problems. He said he is angry no one warned him the drug could have such lasting effects. 'Even if the side effects are rare, that doesn't mean that I should not . have been warned. I did have a life before this,' he told Good Morning America. Dr Irwig said roughly 5 per cent of men who take medicine will experience sexual dysfunction, and of those 'it’s hard to tell how many will experience persistent symptoms'. 'We know that this is a potential problem, but we can’t quantify what the exact risk is. I can’t tell a man if he has a 1-in-100 chance, or a 1-in-1000 chance of developing persistent sexual dysfunction, but it’s pretty clear there’s a relationship here,' he says. Topical Rogaine can be used as an alternative to Propecia - applied directly on the skin, it does not get absorbed by body and thus does not cause sexual side effects - but Dr. Irwig says Propecia is very effective in treating hair loss and thus is commonly prescribed. So Dr Irwig says it is crucial physicians treating male pattern hair loss discuss the possibility of persistent sexual side effects associated with finasteride with their patients. 'I think it’s very important that doctors who are prescribing this medicine talk about potential risks, so men can make an informed decision,' he said. In a statement, Merck said no evidence has proved a causal relationship between Propecia and long-lasting sexual dysfunction. A spokesman said: 'Merck believes that PROPECIA (finasteride) has demonstrated safety and efficacy profiles and that the product labeling appropriately describes the benefits and risks of the drug to help inform prescribing. 'A causal relationship between the use of PROPECIA and continued sexual dysfunction after discontinuation of treatment has not been established.   We encourage patients to talk with their doctor if they have any questions or concerns about their health, or about PROPECIA.'","Doctor reveals twenty percent of patients he interviewed for Propecia study experienced persistent sexual dysfunction for more than five years .

"A teenage girl helped her big sister to give birth at a  rest spot on the I-95  when the baby decided that she couldn't wait for them to get to the hospital. Kennedy Smith, 14, and her sister Kelsea Marcus, 21, were being driven to Christiana Hospital in Newark by their mom on Sunday. But they soon realized that the baby was not going to wait until they got to the hospital as they drove down the busy road near Delaware. Beautiful: Little Karter Zoe Marcus is pictured here with her mom Kelsea Marcus, after she made a dramatic entrance into the world in the front seat of a Lexus . Special delivery: Mom Kelsea holds her newborn baby in the front seat of a car as emergency workers arrive . Stunning: This beautiful little baby Karter Zoe Marcus, was delivered by her aunt Kennedy Smith on Sunday . ‘Everyone was going crazy, so someone had to stay calm and keep everything together,’ Kennedy told Fox 29. Kennedy said she was sitting in the back seat of the car supporting Marcus who was sitting in the front seat and calming their mother down as she drove them at top speed to the hospital. As Smith entered the northbound I-95 from Del. 896, Marcus told her that she was trying not to push, 'but had to.' Kennedy said: ‘Ten minutes after my sister's water broke, the baby came.’ Kennedy called 911 and her mother pulled over into the Delaware Welcome Center on I-95. By that time, the baby was fully delivered with Kennedy's help. The 911 operators instructed Kennedy how to tie off the baby's umbilical cord and wipe the baby's mouth area. Safe hands: Kennedy Smith, 14, is an honor student and helped to deliver the baby, she has plans to enter the medical field and will study  at the University of Pennsylvania next summer . They also instructed her to go six inches down and tie off the umbilical cord. She said that if she hadn't been wearing shoelaces she was prepared to use the string from her hooded sweatshirt instead. The beautiful baby girl was born weighing a healthy seven pounds, one ounce. She was welcomed into the world with kisses and cuddles from her aunt, mom, and great- grandmother. Soon, New Castle paramedics arrived on the scene and assessed both the baby and her mother. They were then transported to the hospital. The baby had been due on September 20 but was not born. Marcus was scheduled to be induced at 9 p.m. on Sunday. But the baby clearly had other plans. Meanwhile, Kennedy, an honor student, says she plans to become a doctor. This summer, she studied at Southern Methodist University in Dallas and is scheduled to study next summer at the University of Pennsylvania. She told Fox 29: 'I'm in a STEM program so I'm training to be a physician. And this gives me more experience I guess so I think I'd actually consider going into medical field and delivering babies.' Her proud mother added: ‘We don't know what we would have done if Kennedy wasn't in the car keeping us calm. It was scary.’","Mom-to-be Kelsea Marcus, 21, was on her way to hospital to give birth .

"By . Vanessa Allen . PUBLISHED: . 04:27 EST, 29 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:49 EST, 5 June 2013 . The girl at the centre of the child cruelty trial told the High Court she went along with her mother’s shocking attempts to get her pregnant because she thought: ‘If I do this . . . maybe she will love me more.’ The girl had been adopted as a baby and raised in a ‘toxic cocoon’ of her mother’s making – an atmosphere of intimidation and disapproval behind the closed  curtains of their terrace house. Despite the bullying and coercion, the girl remained pathetically devoted to her adopted mother and obeyed her commands, driven by a powerful mix of fear and love. Authorities missed four significant opportunities which may have prevented a woman from forcing her adopted daughter to impregnate herself with sperm bought on the internet . In a moment of unbearable poignancy . the girl, known only as A, told how she had gone along with her mother’s . plans to win the woman’s affection. She told the High Court: ‘Mum said to me, “A, the only way I can have a fourth child is for you to get pregnant”. ‘I was shocked, pretty shocked at . first. And then I suddenly thought, “Maybe if I do this then everything . will be over. Mum will be happy like she was before”. ‘And I also thought from a selfish point of view, “If I do this . . . maybe she will love me more”.’ A was only 13 when her mother revealed her plans, and just 14 when the . humiliating and painful ordeal of the insemination  ‘programme’ began. In March 2009, aged 15 and having . already suffered a miscarriage, she sent a Mother’s Day card. The girl . wrote: ‘Happy Mother’s Day List (the things I cannot give you but would . if I could).’ She stuck photographs of her mother’s favourite singers and  television programmes on the card. Below them, next to a photograph of a . positive pregnancy test, she wrote: ‘And the one thing that I can. And . will.’ Remarkably, A told the court hearing she was grateful to her . mother for adopting her and her sisters, saying: ‘My mum has done as . much as she could to give us a good and happy life.’ But Mr Justice Jackson heard  the . mother had excluded her  ex-husband from her daughters’ life and had . schooled them at home, leaving them isolated from the world outside. She could be ‘critical, rigid, . suspicious and obsessive’, the judge said, adding: ‘For the children, . who love her deeply, the threat of her disapproval is always in the . air.’ Eldest daughter A in particular had . coped with her domineering mother by becoming submissive to her, even . dropping her voice so she could barely be heard. Neighbours said she was so quiet and . timid that they had wondered if she had a ‘vocal disability’. Remarkably, it was only by becoming a mother herself that A found the . strength to stand up to the maternal bullying she had suffered. Midwives noticed that she refused to . hand her baby son to her mother, and she rejected the woman’s demands . that she call him Kalei, instead choosing a traditional English name. Astonished: Family judge Mr Justice Jackson expressed his 'abiding sense of disbelief' in a High Court judgement . Fears for her son’s wellbeing finally . drove her to confide in a family friend, an act of courage and defiance . she had been unable to make on her own behalf. A, now 19 and living in a foster home . with her toddler son, told the court: ‘I was scared to go home, because I . knew I wouldn’t be able to raise him as my child and I was scared at . how my mum might raise him.’ Her mother, an educated and highly . articulate woman, also gave the teenager recordings to listen to which . contained subliminal messages, saying: ‘I am going to conceive a girl.’ The girl, who was adopted, had not wanted to become pregnant but was terrified of jeopardising hermother’s love for her. The plan fell apart after the girl . gave birth to a boy and midwives at the hospital became suspiciousof her . mother’s ‘pushy and insensitive’ behaviour towards her and the baby, . and raised the alarm. The Daily Mail can reveal that social . workers were warned three times about the mother, but decided her . children were not at risk. On one occasion a social worker closed the . case after speaking to the mother on the telephone, without even . visiting the family’s home or seeing the children. The mother, a 48-year-old former . nanny, was jailed for five years for bullying her daughter into the . surrogate pregnancy plan and for cruelty towards another of her adopted . children. The case raises worrying questions about the regulation of adoptions from abroad and the sale of donor sperm over the internet. The High Court case was heard in secret but can be reported following a legal challenge by media groups. Family Division judge Mr Justice . Jackson said he felt ‘an abiding sense of disbelief that a parent could . behave in such a wicked and selfish way towards a vulnerable child’. The court heard the American-born . mother, who cannot be named to protect the identities of her three . adopted children and her grandson – the child born to her daughter, . chose to be sterilised in 2001 so she did not pass her diabetes on to . any children. The case was heard in the High Court but reporting restrictions prevent the naming of the family, the local authority and the area they lived in . Instead, she adopted three daughters . as babies from foreign orphanages and foster homes, two while married to . an Irish man and a third as a single parent, and raised them in . Britain. She was banned from adopting more children but longed for another child, and forced her eldest daughter to conceive. She told the girl about her plans . when her daughter was only 13, and the two-year insemination ‘programme’ began when the teenager – identified in legal documents only as A – was . 14. The judge said: ‘A did not want to . take part in the programme, but she allowed her body to be used by her . mother because she loves her. ‘A’s participation in the programme . caused her continuous anxiety. The physical steps that the mother asked . her to take were degrading, humiliating and, on occasions, painful.’ The mother bought frozen sperm over . the internet and prepared syringes full of it for her daughter to use to . inseminate herself. She was desperate that any resulting . baby should be a girl, and forced her daughter to follow a special diet . of dairy and alkaline foods in the belief this would affect the gender . of the child. In July 2010, the mother wrote an . ‘affirmation’ on her computer, setting out her wishes for the future – a . lottery win and a healthy baby girl, who she wanted to call Kelia. She wrote: ‘I desire to win the . Thunderball jackpot of £500,000 and for A to conceive and carry Kelia to . term for birth in April.’ In October that year, A became pregnant and . she gave birth to a son in June 2011, after a difficult labour which . left her needing surgery. Nurses knew she planned to give her . baby to her mother to raise, but were worried by her mother’s aggressive . behaviour, including a refusal to let A breastfeed her baby, saying: . ‘We don’t want any of that attachment thing.’ Midwives raised the alarm when the . mother tried to take the newborn baby from the ward, and A later . confided in a family friend about her ordeal. All four children were . taken into care and the mother was charged with child cruelty. She initially denied the allegations, . accusing her daughter of being a fantasist, and told authorities the . girl was mentally ill. She later pleaded guilty to five charges of child . cruelty. The High Court heard she had raised . her three adopted daughters in a ‘toxic cocoon’, teaching them at home . so they would not go to school and isolating them from friends or . neighbours. When she was 15, A was left alone to . look after her youngest sister, then only four or five, while her mother . and the middle sister went to the US for a ten-day holiday. A told the court she had seen her . mother smack her youngest sister regularly, and said she had tied the . little girl to a chair when she would not sit still and had stuck duct . tape over her mouth for answering back. The court also heard disturbing . details about failed attempts to alert social services to the family’s . set-up. Neighbours described the mother’s terrace home as like a . ‘fortress’, with the curtains always closed and no one allowed inside. In 2006, a GP neighbour contacted . social services, saying she could hear the mother shouting and swearing . at her youngest child, who was then two, and said the toddler was left . crying for up to two hours at a time. Social workers investigated and saw . all three children and the mother, but decided there was no cause for . concern. In January 2007, an anonymous letter was sent to social . services and other authorities. A social worker’s report warned that . the mother ‘appears to be doing things secretively for her own gain’, . but concluded there was no evidence of ‘significant harm’ to the . children, and the case was closed again. In 2008, the GP made another referral . to social services. A third investigation was launched but the case was . closed after social workers spoke to the mother on the telephone, . without seeing the children or visiting the house. Mr Justice Jackson said: ‘Between . 2006 and 2008, the mother succeeded in keeping social services at arm’s . length so that their investigations were essentially superficial. ‘Concerns were seen off by a parent who was recognised to be domineering. The children were never heard.’ The local authority cannot be named . for legal reasons but its Local Safeguarding Children Board has launched . a serious case review, due to be published next month. The LSCB said: ‘Nothing can change what has happened to the children in this truly terrible case. ‘It is clear that public bodies must highlight the major public policy issues which arise from this case.’","'Wicked and selfish' mother forced her daughter to inseminate herself .

"Beer is one of the world's most ancient brews and has played an essential role in society - both for its nutritional and ritual importance - for millennia. Now, 5,000-year-old fragments of pottery used by ancient Egyptians to make beer, have been discovered on a building site in Tel Aviv, Israel. The pottery shards come from large ceramic basins, which were used to prepare fruity beer that was left to ferment under the sun. Scroll down for video . ‘Among the hundreds of pottery shards (pictured) that characterise the local culture, a number of fragments of large ceramic basins were discovered that were made in an Egyptian tradition and were used to prepare beer,’ Dr Barkan said . Diego Barkan, of the Israeli Antiquities Authority, said that 17 pits were found that had been used to store produce in the Early Bronze Age, from 3,500 to 3,000 BC. Beer was the favourite drink of humans and gods in ancient Egypt. It was also drank by rich and poor, adults and children. This was because it was cleaner than water, which came from a river or canal and was often polluted. Beer was considered as staple, along with bread, Reshafim.org reported. Workers were paid with bread, oil, beer and vegetables by their employers. The standard ration was two jars containing three-and-a-half pints (two litres) of beer. Just like today, the Egyptians liked their beer cooled and kept jars in water. ‘Among the hundreds of pottery shards that characterise the local culture, a number of fragments of large ceramic basins were discovered that were made in an Egyptian tradition and were used to prepare beer,’ he said in a statement. The vessels were made with ‘straw temper’ and other organic material to strengthen them – a method which was not in local potteries. The excavation is the first to offer evidence of an ‘Egyptian occupation’ in the centre of Tel Aviv 5,000 years ago. As well as the basins, a bronze dagger and 6,000-year-old flint tools were uncovered. Dr Barken said: ‘This is also the northernmost evidence we have of an Egyptian presence in the early Bronze Age. ‘Until now we were only aware of an Egyptian presence in the northern Negev and southern coastal plain, whereby the northernmost point of Egyptian occupation occurred in Azor. Fragments of pottery that are around 5,000 years old and were used by ancient Egyptians to make beer, have been discovered on a building site in Tel Aviv. Here, Diego Barkan holds the basin parts . Employees of the Israel Antiquities Authority(pictured) work at the site in Tel Aviv where fragments of pottery used by ancient Egyptians have been discovered. A total of 17 pits have revealed finds . As well as the basins, which were pulled from pits in the centre of Tel Aviv (pictured left) a bronze dagger and 6,000-year-old flint tools were uncovered. A flint blade is pictured right . Last year, the tomb of a leading ancient Egyptian beer brewer was discovered. The tomb of Khonso Em Heb, who lived 3,200 years ago, was found by a Japanese team and has been been described as 'one of the most important discoveries' made at the Thebes necropolic site in the city of Luxor. Egypt's antiquities minister Mohamed Ibrahim described Khonso Em Heb as the chief ‘maker of beer for gods of the dead'. He was thought to be the head of a warehouse and judging by the decorations in his tomb was an important and wealthy man. The walls of the tomb contain paintings showing everyday life and rituals. ‘Now we know that they also appreciated what the Tel Aviv region had to offer and that they too knew how to enjoy a glass of beer, just as Tel Avivians do today’. According to the antiquities authority, ‘beer was the Egyptian national drink and was a staple along with bread.’ It said beer was consumed by the entire population of Egypt, regardless of age, gender or status. ‘It was made from a mixture of barley and water that was partially baked and then left to ferment in the sun. ‘Various fruit concentrates were added to this mixture in order to flavour the beer.’ The mixture was filtered in special vessels before serving. Previous excavations carried out in Egypt's Delta region uncovered breweries that indicate beer was already being produced in the mid-fourth millennium BC, the Israeli authority said. The fragments were discovered in pits on Ha-Masger Street in central Tel Aviv (marked on the map). Excavations are taking place before the construction of an office building . The vessels (pictured) were made with ‘straw temper’ and other organic material to strengthen them – a method which was not in local potteries. This one dates to the Early Bronze Age I (3,500 BC) Dr Barken said: ‘This is also the northernmost evidence we have of an Egyptian presence in the early Bronze Age. Here, a worker for the Israel Antiquities Authority cleans findings at the site .","Fragments from ceramic basins were pulled from 17 pits in Tel Aviv, Israel .

""Earlier this day after releasing information Shain Gandee was missing, the Kanawha County Sheriff's Office received word of a disabled vehicle in a wooded area near Thaxton Hollow, Sissonville, Kanawha County WV,"" said a statement from the Sheriff's Office. ""Deputies and members of the Sissonville Volunteer Fire Department used all terrain vehicles to access that vehicle, a 1984 Ford Bronco belonging to the Gandee family. The vehicle was in a muddy area along a worn path. Inside were the bodies of three people."" In a subsequent release, the Sheriff's Office said the vehicle was partially submerged in mud. It was uneven but upright; its muffler was below the surface.

"(CNN) -- As a drone with a sensitive camera scans an expanding search area for missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, investigators are widening their scope to include other missing persons and murder cases. A suspect in custody has been connected to previous sexual assault allegations, and DNA evidence has linked him to the disappearance and death of another young woman in the same area where Graham vanished. At least four women have gone missing there since 2009. Graham, 18, was last seen in Charlottesville's Downtown Mall area on September 13. Investigators believe suspect Jesse Matthew, 32, was the last person with her. He is charged with abduction with the intent to defile. There have been no signs of Graham since. As the search for her and the investigation of Matthew continue, this is what we've learned so far: . Who is Hannah Graham? She's a native of Northern Virginia and tall -- 5 feet, 11 inches with a slender build. Graham has light brown hair, blue eyes and freckles. She was wearing a crop top when she was last seen. She's a second-year University of Virginia student making straight A's, her parents say. And she is a member of the ski team. She had been co-captain of her high school softball team. ""She was extremely smart, very witty, very athletic; she was musically inclined,"" her former coach Craig Maniglia said. She was studying pre-med, he said. There are also photos from a recent trip to France and comments from friends in French on what appears to be her Facebook page. Where was she the night she vanished? On the evening of September 12, she was seen at a party before friends saw her at an apartment complex a couple of blocks away. That was shortly before midnight, according to a timeline compiled by CNN affiliate WVIR. About 12:45 a.m. on September 13, a surveillance camera caught her outside of a pub, about three-quarters of a mile from the apartment complex. Other surveillance cameras captured her, as she ran past a gas station, walked past an Italian cafe and then by a jewelry store. At 1:20 a.m., she texted her friends to say she was lost and trying to find a party, WVIR reported. She and a man were seen having drinks at a bar between 1:30 and 2 a.m., WVIR reports. Police believe she may have been under the influence of alcohol, making her less able to defend herself. What is being done to find her? This is the first time in the state's history that an aerial drone has been used in a missing person search. Authorities are also offering a $100,000 reward for information leading her safe return. More than 3,000 tips to Graham's possible whereabouts have poured in. Police have asked owners of large parcels of property in surrounding counties to search their land and report back. More than 1,200 volunteers have searched around Charlottesville for clues leading to Graham. And the search area has expanded to include U.S. Route 29, outside of Charlottesville, where other women reportedly disappeared. Where is Hannah Graham? What other cases have come up in the investigation? DNA evidence has linked suspect Matthew to the death of a second woman, Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington, who disappeared in 2009, authorities said. She was 20 at the time. Her remains were found on a farm months later. Investigators are also checking other unsolved homicide and missing person cases for possible connections: Those of Cassandra Morton, whose body was found in a wooded area near Lynchburg in November 2009; Samantha Ann Clarke, who was last seen on September 13, 2010; and Virginia Tech students Heidi Childs and David Metzler, who were shot to death in 2009. Route 29 seems to be a ghoulish common denominator. Harrington and Clarke disappeared along the corridor, where Graham also may have vanished. Alexis Murphy of Lovingston, Virginia, also vanished there. All the women were between 17 and 20 years old, CNN affiliate WVIR has reported. Another man, Randy Taylor, was convicted in Murphy's case in August 2013. He maintains he is innocent. And this week, his lawyer, Michael J Hallahan II, asked that evidence in the case be re-examined. ""This is not a fishing expedition, but rather this request is based upon evidence presented at Randy Taylor's trial and based upon these new developments relating to Matthew in the news,"" Hallahan said. ""Maybe it's him (Matthew), maybe it's not. It doesn't hurt to check."" In addition, in 2010, Harrington's case was connected to the 2005 kidnapping and sexual assault of another woman in Fairfax, Virginia. That woman survived her ordeal and provided police a description to make a sketch. Whether the drawing of an African-American male resembles Matthew would have to be left up to interpretation. Authorities check unsolved cases for ties to Graham disappearance . Has Jesse Matthew been in trouble before? Matthew has been accused of sexual assault twice before, when he was in college over a decade ago. A woman reported she was raped on the campus of Liberty University in Lynchburg on October 17, 2002. Matthew was a student at the evangelical Christian college for three years and played on the football team. However, no charges were filed because the woman didn't want to go forward with the case, and investigators determined there wasn't enough evidence to arrest Matthew. Matthew told authorities that the woman consented. There were no witnesses. This week, a ""criminal incident information"" report was released by Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, pointing to a sexual assault allegedly involving Matthew on September 7, 2003. Matthew quit the school's football team after the allegations and later left the school. When Virginia police first looked for Matthew for questioning in the Graham case, he went to a police station, and there he asked for legal representation. Days later, after police obtained an arrest warrant, Matthew was found more than 1,000 miles away on a Texas beach. He did not fight extradition in a Texas court and was taken back to Virginia. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Mike Ahlers and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","The area in which authorities are searching for Graham has expanded .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- The leaders of five of the world's top emerging economies moved closer Thursday toward establishing a development bank that could one day serve as an alternative to the World Bank. The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- collectively known as the BRICS -- ""agreed to examine in greater detail a proposal to set up a BRICS-led South-South Development Bank, funded and managed by the BRICS and other developing countries,"" said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India. The leaders were meeting in New Delhi on Thursday for their fourth annual summit. Finance ministers from the five countries have been directed to look into the idea of the development bank and report back at the next summit, Singh said. The leaders also asked the International Monetary Fund to speed up changes in its governance to better represent the developing world as a voting bloc. ""The rapid recovery of the BRICS economies from the financial crisis highlighted their role as growth drivers of the global economy,"" Singh said. Together, the BRICS nations make up more than 40% of the world population and one-fifth of the global economy. The group called for peaceful resolutions of the Syria and Iranian crises. ""We agreed that a lasting solution to the problems in Syria and Iran can only be found through dialogue,"" Singh said. Besides the IMF, the leaders also urged reforms of the United Nations and other international bodies for a larger voice for the developing world. ""Institutions of global political and economic governance created more than six decades ago have not kept pace with the changing world. While some progress has been made in international financial institutions, there is lack of movement on the political side,"" Singh said.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . The wife of former New York Giants player Luke Petitgout has filed for divorce following a recent alleged assault at a swanky New York City lounge. The New York Post reports that Jennifer Marino Petitgout filed for divorce in New Jersey on Tuesday to end a 13-year-marriage from which she has three children. She's also allegedly trying to make her current temporary restraining order permanent. Jennifer Marino Petitgout pictured here with her three daughters allegedly filed for divorce from her husband Luke Petitgout on Tuesday . Luke Petitgout is a former football player on the NFL team The New York Giants . A source told The Post that Jennifer, 'changed the locks on their marital home and has new codes on her alarm system.' The source also told them that cops will be escorting Luke to the house on Friday so that he can gather his possessions. The couple live in Woodcliff lake, NJ. and together they have three young daughters. The most recent alleged assault took place on June 5 when Jennifer was partying with two friends at 48 Lounge in Manhattan. Jennifer and her friends were speaking to two men, one of whom the women knew. At around midnight, Luke allegedly stormed into the lounge in a fit of rage and reportedly attacked one of the men in the right eye, John Constantinides, 43, before slapping his wife. He allegedly had to be restrained by the bouncers until the cops arrived to arrest him. Jennifer Marino Petitgout was allegedly attacked by her husband Luke Petitgout at 48 Lounge (pictured) on June 5 .

Cops say she told them she 'feared fro her life.' Petigout was charged with misdemeanor assault but Jennifer dropped the charges against her 6-foot-6, 310 pound husband-not this time, however.

"Relatives of the 96 fans who died gasped as David Duckenfield told the new inquests: ""I apologise unreservedly to the families.""
He said: ""Everybody knew the truth, the fans and police knew the truth that we'd opened the gates.""
Mr Duckenfield, 70, said he would regret the lie ""to his dying day"".
He was in charge of policing at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium on 15 April 1989 when a fatal crush developed in terraced pens allocated to Liverpool fans.
The court heard that on the day Mr Duckenfield told Graham Kelly, of the FA, that some fans had got in themselves through gate C, when the truth was that he had ordered the gate to be opened.
Christina Lambert QC, counsel for the inquests, said some witnesses have spoken of having a ""clear recollection"" that Mr Duckenfield ""made reference to gates having been stormed"".
He said he does not recall being as ""dramatic"" as that.
Ms Lambert asked: ""Did you appreciate that what you said and indeed, what you did not say, could or might bear that meaning to Mr Kelly and others?""
He replied: ""Yes ma'am. I didn't give him sufficient information to appreciate the situation as it occurred.""
Mr Duckenfield went on to say: ""It was a situation I was totally untrained for, totally unprecedented, and I make no excuses. I was the man who did it. But I faced a difficult situation.
""I said something rather hurriedly, without considering the position, without thinking of the consequences and the trauma, the heartache and distress that the inference would have caused to those people who were already in a deep state of shock, who were distressed. I apologise unreservedly to the families.""
He told the court that he had ""no idea"" what motivated him to lie.
Earlier, Mr Duckenfield said it was ""one of the biggest regrets of his life"" that he did not consider the consequences of opening the gate.
He said he was unaware that turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end fed into an inner concourse and that gate C was opposite a tunnel into the terraces.
Mr Duckenfield said he did not think before opening the gates about blocking the tunnel off with a line of police officers - as had happened in previous years.
The inquests heard he had not been aware that at 14:30, some 5,700 fans were still trying to enter the ground outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles because he did not know the club had a system for monitoring the supporters.
It meant 800 fans would have to go through each turnstile in 30 minutes to get in for kick-off.
Mr Duckenfield said he ""accepted"" this was ""not going to happen"".
Mr Duckenfield, who had been stationed in the police control box with a bank of TV monitors, said he was ""shocked"" at the request from Supt Roger Marshall to open the Leppings Lane gates after police became ""overwhelmed"" by the number of fans.
The witness continued: ""I was shocked and taken aback by it and thinking, 'Where are these people going to go if I open the gates?""'
He said another message then came through on the police radio from Mr Marshall saying: ""If we don't open the gates someone's going to get killed.""
Mr Duckenfield said: ""That really was a shocking, terrifying moment to feel you had got to that situation.""
Another officer in the police box, Mr Bernard Murray, then said to him: ""Are you going to open the gates?"" the jury heard.
Mr Duckenfield said: ""I remember saying to him quite clearly, Mr Murray, if people are going to die I have no option but to open the gates. Open the gates.""
He said he thought fans would feel ""relief and comfort"" in being released from the crush of the turnstiles on to the concourse.
""I think it is fair to say it is arguably one of the biggest regrets of my life that I did not foresee where the fans would go when they came in through the gates,"" he continued.
""I was overcome by the enormity of the situation and the decision I had to make and, as a result of that, this is probably very hard to admit, as a result of that I was so overcome probably with emotion of us having got into that situation that my mind for a moment went blank.""
Mr Duckenfield was questioned in front of about 200 relatives of those who died as a result of the disaster.
Ms Lambert asked him if he ""should have taken steps"" to delay the start of the match.
He responded: ""I accept that view now, ma'am"".
Asked what he would have done had he known there were so many supporters waiting to enter, he replied: ""I would have informed the club. I would have informed the referee that we had a difficulty arising and that on the evidence we had available, we should consider delaying the kick-off.""
On the day of the match, police could only judge how full the pens in the terraces were by looking at CCTV and the terraces.
There were counters on the banks of turnstiles but these did not track how many people were going into each pen.
Earlier, Mr Duckenfield also told the jury he could not account for his movements for a period of more than two hours before he took up his position in the police control box on the afternoon of the semi-final.
He told the inquests his mind was ""a complete blank"" and he could only remember being taken ""taken out"" in a police car by a colleague and ""we drove around"".
Ms Lambert put it to Mr Duckenfield that this was a ""significant period of time"" and would have been a ""golden opportunity"" to get to know the ground better, on what was to be his first match as commander.
Mr Duckenfield agreed that it was, but said he could not recall whether it was an opportunity he had taken.
Ms Lambert also said it would have been a good opportunity for Mr Duckenfield to survey the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end.
Again, Mr Duckenfield agreed.
He accepted it was ""part of his job as a match commander to have a basic knowledge of the layout of the stadium"".
Earlier the retired officer said he had urged police to ensure both sets of fans had ""a good day out.""
He wrote a briefing document for officers before the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, the jury was told.
In the note he said: ""I cannot stress too highly the word safety. The ground will be full to capacity"".
He recalled telling officers that ""...it was supposed to be a wonderful occasion for both the Liverpool and Notts fans. They were to come along and enjoy themselves, and we, the police service, were to ensure that they had a good day out.
""We were to be tolerant, understanding of their enthusiasm, treat them with respect, and put ourselves forward as a professional and caring organisation"".
The inquests continue.

Spotted: The footage from inside a mall close to her hostel shows her eating lunch in the cafeteria . They are now trying to establish why the photographer, who had never travelled out of the U.S. before, took the trips, as well as the identity of the man. Friends say he was a Dutch tour guide. Her husband Steven, from Staten Island, said . Sierra was in constant contact with him throughout the trip and knew she . had travelled outside Turkey. 'These are things she made me well aware . of,' he told Staten Island Live before leaving for Istanbul. 'She kept me 100 percent updated.' Turkey's Dogan news agency said police had learned that Sierra had travelled . to Amsterdam on January 15 and then on to Munich on January 16, before returning to . Istanbul on January 19. VIDEO: Police release CCTV of Sarai Sierra in Istanbul mall . No trace: Sarai Sierra, a 33-year-old mother of two young sons, set off for Istanbul January 7 and has since vanished. Her family last heard from her January 21 and she failed to catch her flight home . Her husband continued: 'Every day while she was there she pretty much kept in . contact with us, letting us know what she was up to, where she was . going, whether it be through texting or whether it be through video . chat, she was touching base with us.' Of the man she was chatting to on the . internet, he only added: 'I am aware of the gentleman she was speaking . to in the Netherlands. He was a tour guide.' Sarai, 33, was supposed to land in the U.S. on January 22, but she never arrived. Airline staff at Newark Airport told her husband she had never . boarded her flight. Her two sons, who are aged 11 and 9, have not been told their mother is missing. Mother: Sarai is pictured with her two sons, who are now 9 and 11. They do not know their mother is missing . Apart: Sarai's husband Steven, pictured, said she had told him about her trips to other countries . A . police official said authorities have been reviewing footage from . around Istanbul's Taksim neighborhood - the city's main hub where she . was staying at a hostel. Mystery: Police are trying to establish the identity of a man Sarai was chatting with on the internet . Several police teams have also been . dispatched to surrounding neighborhoods to find possible clues and . witnesses, the official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity, . in line with government rules that bar civil servants from speaking to . reporters without prior authorization. Before she went missing, the . mother-of-two told family members that she planned to take some . photographs at Galata Bridge, a well-known tourist destination about a . mile away from Taksim that spans the Golden Horn waterway. Sierra had planned to go on the trip . with a friend but ended up going by herself when the friend couldn't . make it. She was looking forward to exploring her hobby of photography, . her family said. She was supposed to begin traveling home and was scheduled to arrive in New York City on Tuesday afternoon. Her husband, Steven Sierra, waited for . hours at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on the 22nd . to pick her up. Airline attendants in Turkey said that his wife did not . show up for the flight. Her belongings, including her . passport, phone, phone chargers, and medical cards, were found in her room at a hostel in Beyoglu, Turkey. An official said authorities were therefore not able to track her by her cell phone. Mystery: A view of the street with the hostel, in yellow, where Sarai Sierra, a New York City woman, left all her possessions before she disappeared . Skyline: Mrs Sierra posted a series of pictures from Turkey on her Instagram account, including this one of Isanbul .

Mr Sierra told ABC News that . her behavior is highly unusual, that she seemed perfectly content with her life, and that going off the radar is . extremely out-of-character for her. The heartbroken . husband said that he's been married to her for more than 14 years after meeting her at a church youth group, . adding that his love for her is ‘deeper than it is for any individual'. He told WABC: ‘You . have so many thoughts going through your mind, you don’t know what to . think, you don’t know what to believe, you don’t know what to expect, . you don’t know what will come out of this.' Mrs Sierra's friend, Magalena Rodriguez, told the . New York Daily News that the petite woman, who stands at 5ft2in and . weighs only 110 pounds, has previously fainted without warning. Man on a mission: Mr Sierra has arrived in Turkey to help local authorities search for his wife . Last stop: Mrs Sierra told her mother on her last day in Istanbul she planned to visit the Galata Bridge but missed her flight back . Ms Rodriguez fears her friend has fainted and could be hurt somewhere in the unfamiliar country. Crime in Turkey is generally low and . Istanbul is a relatively safe city for travelers, though there are areas . where women would be advised to avoid going alone at night. The Galata and the nearby Galata Bridge areas have been gentrified and are home to fish restaurants, cafes and boutiques.","Sarai Sierra, 33, a photographer, took trip to Turkey on her own .

"By . Donna Sawyer . A 41-year-old elephant has been introduced to its another of its kind for the first time in over three decades. Mila met Mary, the leader of the herd at San Diego Zoo, after being kept as a lone elephant in a circus for over 30 years and then taken in by Franklin Zoo in New Zealand. Video footage of the heart-warming meeting shows the African elephants entwining their trunks through a wire fence. Scroll down for video . Kindred spirits: Mila meets herd leader Mary at San Diego Zoo after being kept as a lone elephant in a circus for over 30 years . It is common for elephants to communicate by touching and entwining their trunks, according to African Elephant expert Tim Fullman's website. He writes that trunks 'play an important role in smell and that rubbing trunks in greeting may be partially to smell each other to gain information.' Mila's former keeper Helen Schofield, who was crushed to death by Mila in an accident in 2012, had always hoped the elephant would one day be returned to a herd of its own kind. The tragic incident sparked a fundraising effort by supporters of the zoo, who hoped to raise enough money for Mila to be relocated to a zoo with that had other African elephants. The supporters raised $1.5 million, enough for Mila to be moved from New Zealand to San Diego Zoo. Friendship grows: Mila entwines trunks with the matriach of the herd Mary in a heart-warming scene . Touching trunks: It is common for elephants to communicate to each other by touching and entwining their trunks . Elephant talk: Trunks play an important role in smell and this greeting may be to smell each other to gain information . San Diego Zoo's African elephant herd includes six African and Indian elephants ranging in age from 33 to 49 years old. Lead keeper at the zoo Ron Ringer says that so far, Mila and Mary are really hitting it off. 'Mary walked up to Mila and they both started eating from the same tree,' Mr Ringer said. 'This is a great behavior to see because they were both calm and accepting of each other and it’s one of the types of things we look for with animal introductions.' Accidental death: Mila's former keeper Helen Schofield was crushed to death by the elephant in an accident in 2012 . Zoo keepers felt the best way to introduce Mila to the herd was to start with a one-on-one with the matriach. 'In late January, we gave Mila the first opportunity to meet another elephant with limited interaction. We decided that Mary was the best option, given she is a dominant elephant in the herd, is relatively calm, and has a good track record with meeting newcomers.' 'Being excited, nervous, scared, aggressive, or submissive were all possibilities we could have expected to observe,' zookeeper Robbie Clark said. 'Mary was curious of the newbie while Mila was surprised to find something as big as her on the other side of the wall!'","41-year-old elephant meets another elephant for the first time in 37 years .

"(CNN) -- Getafe became the third Spanish football club to pass into foreign ownership on Thursday after signing a deal with Dubai's Royal Emirates Group. The Madrid-based team followed in the footsteps of Malaga and Racing Santander, which were also taken over by overseas interests in the past year. Royal Emirates Group, a conglomerate chaired by Sheikh Butti Bin Suhail Al Maktoum, has a portfolio of more than 200 companies including oil and gas, renewable energy, travel and tourism, health care, water purification, real estate & construction. The deal is worth between €70-90 million ($101-131 million) and will see the club's title rebranded to ""Getafe CF Team Dubai."" Getafe's previous owner and president Don Angel Torres Sanchez signed over to his successors in a ceremony at Dubai's Burj Al Arab hotel on Thursday, accompanied by club captain Manu del Moral. The group said it was heavily involved in sports in the United Arab Emirates and abroad. ""The investment in Getafe CF is an evolution of this vision and an expression of renewed confidence that Dubai's businesses are more confident today to make large investments abroad as well as at home,"" Royal Emirates partner managing director Dr. Kaiser Rafiq said. ""Caring for community needs through sport is at the heart of what the Royal Emirates Group aims to achieve. This will send the positive message to the world that Dubai cares."" Rafiq said that, being conscious of football's popularity with young Arabs, the group hoped to build a bridge between Europe and the Middle East ahead of the 2022 World Cup to be staged in Qatar. ""Royal Emirates Group plans to invest heavily in inducting new blood and promoting the team in the region,"" he said. Getafe, first formed in 1946 and refounded in 1983, has been in Spain's top flight since 2004-05. The club made a strong start to this season but hopes of qualifying for Europe have evaporated, with coach Michel's team 14th out of 20 with six matches remaining. Malaga became the first Spanish club to be bought by a foreign investor when Qatari billionaire Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani paid a reported €36 million ($52 million) in June 10. He splashed out on players and hired former Real Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini, but the club is battling to avoid relegation. Santander sold out to Indian businessman Ahsan Ali Syed in January, with his Western Gulf Advisory company taking over. Since replacing coach Miguel Angel Portugal with the club's former boss Marcelino, the Cantabria-based team is four points above 17th-placed Malaga.","Royal Emirates Group completes takeover of Spanish club Getafe .

"These unusual structures - with their intricate designs and symmetrical forms - may look like they have been created by a 3D printer, but they are in fact more than a century old. Displayed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), they are the artistic equivalent of a mathematical equation. According to the team that collected the designs, the structures reveal how mathematics can describe the world around us, even in its most complex forms. The unusual structures - with their intricate designs and symmetrical forms - may look like they have been created by a 3D printer, but they are in fact more than a century old . The Clebsch Diagonal Surface is one of the most famous surfaces in mathematics.  It was described by Alfred Clebsch in 1871. It is remarkable as it has exactly 27 straight lines that lie flush to its surface. The surface has three branches that join in a central column and in a flaring base. The 27 lines, etched in black, extend toward infinity. There are exactly 10 points on the structure’s surface where three of the 27 lines meet. These points are called Eckardt points, and the Clebsch diagonal surface is the only cubic surface to contain them. Joshua Batson in Wired reports that the structures were created by Göttingen-based mathematician Felix Klein and displayed in Chicago in 1893. MIT, the University of Arizona, Harvard, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ordered a large collection of his models which are now on display. ‘Digitally controlled 3D printers now produce such mathematical objects in exactly the same way as people did a century ago,’ Professor George Francis from the University of Illinois told MailOnline. ‘Both compute the data points from formulas, and build up the models, layer by layer like a wedding cake - but with thinner layers.’ MIT describes the structures as the artistic equivalent of a mathematical equation, designed to let algebra move away from the chalkboard and into physical form .

"This picture of a banged-up Ferrari Enzo is enough to make any car lover shed a tear. The rare million-dollar vehicle was involved in a crash in Stamford, Connecticut on Monday when a mechanic took the sports car out for a ride and spun out of control. The car's owner, 71-year-old mattress company mogul Michael Fux, had placed the prized car in the care of Greenwich dealership Miller Motorcars. Abused: A rare Ferrari Enzo was badly damaged in a Monday morning crash in Stamford, Connecticut. A technician was driving the vehicle at the time . Crashed: Ferrari technician Leonardo Garcia, 40, was driving the rare car owned by 71-year-old mattress mogul Michael Fux. Aston Martin technician Daniel Palchik, 31, was also in the vehicle at the time of the crash . The man driving the Ferrari has been identified as technician Leonardo Garcia, 40, was was accompanied by Aston Martin technician Daniel Palchik, 31, for the ride. Garcia lost control of the 650-horsepower car while traveling up the northbound entrance of Interstate 95 around 8:45am, causing the car to fishtail. The car spun across three lanes before hitting a bridge wall and smashing into the center divider, heavily damaging the right side of the car. Private investigator John Michael Hoda was driving southbound when he saw the accident, and told MailOnline he was the first to respond to the scene. He says he pulled both Garcia and Palchik out of the 'totalled' vehicle to safety and that neither were wearing seat belts. Private investigator John Hoda was driving on the other side of the road and was the first to respond to the crash. He took this image, which shows a man sitting on the side of the road and wearing a Miller Motorcars shirt . Garcia suffered a minor cut while Palchik was unhurt . Neither the dealership or owner have commented on the crash, but Fux is no doubt mourning the loss of the car. He told Bed Times Magazine, a trade publication serving the sleep products industry, that he is a 'car freak' and dreamed of owning rare vehicles since he was a little boy growing up poor in Cuba. When he struck his fortune founding mattress company Sleep Innovations, Fux started collecting like mad and last year owned 129 vehicles including 25 Ferraris, 12 Porches, 11 Aston Martins and six Rolls-Royces. The Ferrario Enzo is a special edition sports car named after the Italian motor company's founder, and only 400 were made. But it's not Fux's most valuable car. He also owns a Ferrari FXX, one of only 30 in the world, as well as the first-ever bespoke Rolls-Royce Ghost . He houses the collection in a 30,000-square foot garage at his Milford, NJ home named 'Horse Power Farm'. Fux hopes to build a museum to house the collection, with admission benefiting the Miami Children's Hospital.

"(CNN) -- A 17-year-old student was formally charged Tuesday with the kidnapping, sexual assault and murder of 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway, whose body parts were found at a park in a Denver suburb earlier this month. Austin Reed Sigg, a student at Arapahoe Community College, was also charged with attempting to kidnap, sexually assault and murder a female jogger last May. The charges were outlined in a 17-count accusation filed by Jefferson County, Colorado, District Attorney Pam Russell Tuesday. Sigg, who lived about one mile from Ridgeway's home in Westminster, was charged as an adult, a decision that could be challenged by his lawyers. The teen was arrested a week ago and accused of strangling Ridgeway, dismembering her and placing some of her body parts in a crawlspace under his family's home. Police first found parts of her body at a park 5 miles away five days after the bespectacled blonde girl disappeared while walking to Witt Elementary School on October 5. The big break in the investigation came last Tuesday night, when Sigg's mother called 911 and handed him the phone. Sigg, police said, confessed. Along with charges related to Jessica's death, Sigg is also accused in the May assault of a 22-year-old woman on a hiking trail. Suspect in Jessica Ridgeway death made girls in the area uneasy .

"By . Martha De Lacey . If you get dizzy at the top of tall buildings, spare a thought for Laura Taylor. The 22-year-old from Essex no doubt experienced more than just the head-rush of vertigo when her brave boyfriend sprung her with a marriage proposal 800ft above London at the top of the newly-opened Shard. Miss Taylor was with her boyfriend James Episcopou, also 22 and from Essex, at the official opening of the Shard's observation deck on level 72, when her beau got down on one knee and surprised her. James Episcopou proposing to Laura Taylor at top of the Shard 800ft above London as Boris Johnson opens building . Moments earlier, Mayor Boris Johnson cut the ribbon to welcome visitors to the highest vantage point in western Europe - 800ft (244m) above London. Undaunted by the world's media and the Mayor of London watching him, Mr Episcopou dropped to one knee beside the glass wall and asked for his girlfriend's hand in marriage... and was rewarded for his bravery when Miss Taylor said yes. The engagement took place on level 72 of the Shard, just over 800ft (244m) above the capital. After the event, Mr Episcopou, a supervisor at John Lewis, said he had no idea that Boris Johnson and a media pack would be on the observation deck at the same time. He said: 'I've had it planned since July last year. When tickets first came out I thought I've got to buy them, it's the perfect place to propose. 'Laura means everything to me and I wanted to make her feel on top of the world. 'We had no idea the media were going to be there, but when we arrived we saw Boris Johnson and there were cameras everywhere.' When asked if the presence of the media made him even more nervous, he replied: ""There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to do it. 'For Laura it's made the day even more special. When people plan a proposal they think, ""how can I make it special?"". I managed to do quite a good job.' Miss Taylor, a 22-year-old accountant, said: 'I had no idea he had planned it. I thought we were going up to look at the view. 'James asked me to come over to him because some photographers would like to take our picture. The next moment he was on one knee and proposing. I was so shocked. I said ""yes, definitely"", but then I was speechless.' Laura Taylor got engaged to James Episcopou at the top of The Shard . Mr Johnson described London's tallest building as 'a most amazing place'. He said: 'I don't think there's anything in London like this. 'It's the closest thing to being in an airplane and looking down on London. But you can walk around, you've got complete stability. 'You can see all the bends in the river, you can see my office, you can see Buckingham Palace, you can see the whole thing for 40 miles around.' The Shard's architect, Renzo Piano, added: 'This building is magic for a number of reasons. 'First, because it's in London, second, because it's so tall, and third, because this building is a part of London. It's a sense of London. 'It's sad when London is sad, it's joyful when London is brilliant and joyful.' Some 800ft in the air, James Episcopou asked Laura Taylor to be his wife . On a clear day, visitors to the Shard, which towers over the city at a height of 1,016ft, are promised a spectacular view of the capital. But visibility was restricted for the dignitaries, journalists and members of the public attending the launch because of wet and cloudy weather. Some 4,800 people paid for admission today - at £24.95 for adults and £18.95 for children. Terry Quelch and his wife Merill travelled from Bristol to be among the first to experience the new attraction. Mr Quelch, 69, said: 'It's great looking down and seeing all the landmarks. I do like the shape of the building, the way it spikes up like an icicle in reverse.' His wife, 65, said: 'London hasn't had anything like this since the Eye. I think it's brilliant.' The engagement took place on level 72 of the Shard, just over 800ft (244m) above the capital . On a clear day, visitors will be able to enjoy a 360-degree view of the capital's skyline, from a platform almost twice the height of any other in the city. With the help of specially designed telescopes, they should be able to pick out London's landmarks in the streets below. Visitors to the attraction - on floors 68, 69 and 72 - are whisked up in two high-speed lifts in around 60 seconds. Irvine Sellar, chairman of Sellar Property and developer of the Shard, said: 'I think Londoners will feel ownership of the Shard. They'll adopt it as the Parisians adopted the Eiffel Tower or the Americans adopted the Empire State. 'I think we need a new landmark building, something that stands out.' Boris Johnson cuts the ribbon on the Shard observation deck . Anders Nyberg, chief executive of The View from The Shard, claimed it offered a unique experience. 'You're seeing a tapestry of history,' he said. 'We're in a 21st century tower, right across the river from an 11th century tower, the Tower of London. Nowhere else in the world can you get that kind of perspective.' Heavy clouds cover the London skyline, as seen from The View at the Shard building in London, which opens to the public today .","James Episcopou, 22, proposed to Laura Taylor, 22, both from Essex .

"By . Peter Rugg . An Arkansas man in custody for allegedly killing his pregnant girlfriend claims he has no memory of assaulting her. Douglas True, 21, reportedly dialed 911 for Fort Smith Police at around 11:52 a.m. on Sunday, asking that they come to a home on the 2900 block of South 66th Street. He waved them into the driveway, and upon entering the house police discovered the body of Briana Butler stabbed to death and lying on the bathroom floor. She was 22 years old and seven months pregnant. Scroll down for video . Police say Briana Butler was found stabbed to death seven months into a pregnancy this Sunday after a fight with her boyfriend . Douglas True, 21, told police that he had fought with Butler but had no memory of stabbing her to death . Butler's daughter Bonnie, 2, was discovered sleeping in a nearby room with minor facial injuries, KFSM reports. The toddler was immediately transported to a local hospital and should make a full recovery. Upon searching the home police recovered a knife they believe was used in the homicide, and it was later confirmed that lacerations on her throat and torso were consistent with knife wounds. True was arrested on suspicion of two charges of capital murder for her and her unborn child. He has been transferred to Sebastian County Detention Center to be held without bond. Police say True called his mother to say he'd done a terrible thing and would spend his life in prison . 'True was advised of his rights and gave a statement admitting that he and Butler got into an argument that escalated to a physical altercation,' according to an affidavit. 'True stated that he was intoxicated and did not remember what happened after that. True said that he got up in the middle of the night and found Butler's body in the bathroom and went back to the couch and passed out.' The next morning he woke up, cut a cast off his arm, then called his mother to tell her he'd done something bad and would spend the rest of his life in prison. Chief deputy prosecutor Linda Ward told the Times Record the investigation will continue before charges are filed. Butler's ex-husband and father of Bonnie, Joshua Butler, told WHBS that Bonnie had been an attentive and conscientious mother. Because Butler was pregnant, as this sonogram shows, True is being charged with two murders . 'No human being deserves to be done like that,' said Butler's ex-husband and father of Bonnie, Joshua Butler. 'To take your anger and rage out on another person and just totally take . them out, I mean that's just, cowardly right there' Eyewitness Barry Wayne, who saw True's arrest, said that a niece living in the complex where the crime took palce told him she was scared something had happened. 'She had never been in nothing like this before,' he said, 'I seen . three or four police cars and then I was sitting on the porch, and I . seen a gentlemen in the back and they said he had murdered her.' He said the girl would move out soon.

"There can't be many days in the year when pedestrians, cyclists - and skateboarders - reign supreme on some of Israel's busiest roads. In a scene which could have come straight from a movie, there isn't a car in sight as families, teenagers and Rabbis freely roam the empty streets. On any other day, you might expect the highways in and around Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to be teeming with traffic, choking fumes rising above the cityscape. Deserted: These youngsters on a bike and a skateboard take advantage of the empty streets of Jerusalem during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur . Pedestrians crossing: An Israeli family takes a stroll on a deserted highway in Tel Aviv . Nice day for it: Two Orthodox Jewish men walk down a road surrounded by cyclists . But thanks to the holiest Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur the streets are empty and the air is clear, allowing many to enjoy a rare car-free day. Yom Kippur - or Day of Atonement - is the holiest of Jewish holidays, when observant Jews atone for sins of the last year. Israel came to a standstill for 24 hours during the holiday, in which Jews fast and Israelis are prohibited from driving their cars. As these incredible pictures show, youths on skateboards and bikes, joggers - and even Orthodox Jewish men - take to the tarmac making some of Israel's busiest cities look like ghost towns. Ghost town: There can't be many days in the year when boys on BMX bikes rule the roads . Holiest of Jewish holidays: Yom Kippur sees Israel come to a standstill for 24 hours - observant Jews fast while the whole country is banned from driving . Smog-free: The air must surely be clearer during Yom Kippur as there are no car exhausts emitting fumes . Meanwhile, headstones at a Muslim and a Christian cemetery were desecrated by unknown assailants in Jaffa today, an Israeli website said. Pictures of one gravestone with the words 'death to Arabs' spray painted . in Hebrew and the words 'Price tag', a slogan used by militant Jewish . West Bank settlers and their supporters, on another. A third photograph showed a broken tombstone but none of the photographs could be independently verified due to the fast day's traditional travel limitations. The 'price-taggers' have vowed to avenge any move by Israel to uproot settlement outposts built in the occupied West Bank without Israeli government permission and have torched mosques and vandalised both Israeli and Palestinian property. City of the cyclists: These Israeli boys ride their bikes down an empty motorway in Tel Aviv . Police and Jewish Israeli officials were not available for comment during the Yom Kippur fast day and a local Muslim community leader in Jaffa quoted in the article did not reply when contacted. Jaffa is the ancient part of Tel Aviv which has a mixed Arab and Jewish population. On Monday, a mosque in a Bedouin village in northern Israel was set on fire and graffiti sprayed on its walls in an attack authorities have blamed on hard-line Jewish settlers. The torching drew broad condemnation from top Israeli leaders and President Shimon Peres and the country's chief rabbis also visited the scene to calm tensions. In 2005 a Jewish couple was charged for throwing a pig's head into a Tel Aviv mosque in an attempt to derail Israel's then pullout from the Gaza Strip which went ahead in August of that year. In 2008 riots erupted in the coastal city of Acre in northern Israel when Jews accosted an Arab man who drove his car into a predominantly Jewish neighborhood during Yom Kippur when all traffic halts and the country shuts down for 24 hours. That's quite a sight: The Jewish 'Day of Atonement' see observant Jews atoning for their sins of the past year .","Traffic comes to a standstill for 24 hours as cars are banned in Israel .

Fisher Auction Company and the Jills, a Coldwell Banker Residential Real estate team, announced the sale of the Casa Casuarina, formerly the Versace Mansion. Auctioneer Lamar Fisher said the buyer was Joe Nakash, whose family owns the Jordache denim brand. The family also owns the Victor Hotel next door and they told Fisher that they plan on turning the mansion into a boutique hotel. Donald Trump -- the real estate magnate and TV personality -- placed the second highest bid on the mansion at $41 million, according to Rhona Graff, a senior vice president at the Trump Organization.

"Royal Bank of Scotland’s bosses were warned about the danger of a computer meltdown two years before an IT glitch caused chaos for millions of its customers. But it has paid customer less than £5 compensation on average, with 2.7million receiving less than £1. The explosive details emerged yesterday as the state backed lender was hit with a record £56million fine for a botched software upgrade in June 2012 which locked millions of its customers out of their bank accounts. Royal Bank of Scotland was hit with a record £56m fine for a botched software upgrade in June 2012 . Underlining the seriousness of the failings, the fine marks the first joint penalty between City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority, established to prevent another financial crisis. Issuing its first penalty - of £14million - the PRA said the RBS’s ‘IT incident’ could have had ‘adverse effects on the stability of the financial system’ by disrupting the clearing system, which is used to settle payments among banks. Tracey McDermott, the FCA’s director of enforcement and financial crime, said: ‘Modern banking depends on effective, reliable and resilient IT systems. The bank’’s failures meant millions of customers were unable to carry out the banking transactions which keep businesses and people’s everyday lives moving.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘This is another disastrous fine for RBS after a series of failures. RBS’s priorities under Fred Goodwin meant that it neglected its IT systems, which in some cases are now decades out of date.’ The issues in June 2012 stemmed from a botched upgrade to the software that processed updates to customers’ accounts overnight. The disruption lasted for more than a week for RBS and NatWest customers, and more than three weeks for Ulster Bank, RBS’s Irish subsidiary. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘This is another disastrous fine for RBS after a series of failures' RBS admitted to ‘unacceptable weaknesses’ in its computer systems as around 6.5million customers – equivalent to 10pc of the UK population – could not pay bills or receive money and wages into their bank accounts. It revealed that it has paid a total of just over £70million in compensation to customers who were hit with overdraft charges or incurred other expenses because of the meltdown. But the lender, which promised to ensure no customers are left out of pocket, admitted this equates to an average of just £4.83 for the 4.7million retail customers of RBS and NatWest customers affected. Some 2.7m customer received less than £1 due to lost interest on current accounts and savings. The bank could not provide a breakdown of compensation for Ulster Bank and business customers. Last night one MP branded the compensation ‘derisory’. John Mann, Labour member of the Treasury Select Committee said: ‘This compensation is equivalent to not much more than a pint of beer. Yet again customers are not being looked after while people at the top get excessive pay and bonuses.’ Yesterday regulators revealed that the dangers of the ‘batch scheduler’ software failing were flagged up to management on August 1 2010, just under two years before the systems meltdown. RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton said: 'I want to apologise to all customers in the UK and Ireland that we let down two and a half years ago' For this reason it fined RBS for ‘breaches’ covering the period from August 1 2010, to July 2012, when the problem was finally fixed. RBS’s new chief administration officer Simon McNamara, brought in last year to clean up the mess, yesterday insisted the specific problem was ‘not explicitly called out’ to RBS bosses by internal auditors. He said the bank had committed to spend £750million by 2015 on making its IT systems more secure and added that the ‘door is open’ to customers who believe they are still out of pocket as a result of the failings. Former chief executive Stephen Hester waived his £963,000 bonus over the IT debacle. The latest fine comes as he already faces pressure to hand back a £1million long term shares bonus he received earlier this year, despite being ousted from his position last summer. Last week RBS was fined £400million by UK and US regulators for rigging the £3 trillion a day foreign exchange market under Mr Hester’s watch. RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton said: ‘Our IT failure in the summer of 2012 revealed unacceptable weaknesses in our systems and caused significant stress for many of our customers. As I did back then, I want to apologise to all customers in the UK and Ireland that we let down two and a half years ago.’ RBS and NatWest have 26million UK customers, 4,000 ATMs and 2,120 bank branches.","RBS has paid customers hit by a computer meltdown average of £5 each .

The wife of Jerry Sandusky defended her husband on the stand during the sixth day of his child sex abuse trial, saying that she remembers most of his accusers, and never witnessed them having sexual contact with the ex-Penn State football coach. Dottie Sandusky, who has stood by her husband - including posting his bail - told jurors on Tuesday that she never saw anything inappropriate between her husband and the boys. When asked by lead prosecutor Joe McGettigan why the men might lie in making the accusations, she said: 'I don't know what it would be for,' while shaking of her head. Scroll down for video . Wife: A smiling Dorothy Sandusky, wife of former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky, arrives on the sixth day of her husband's trial . She said one of accusers, dubbed Victim 10 in court records, she did not know at all. She described Victim 1 as 'clingy,' Victim 9 as 'a charmer' and Victim 4 as 'very conniving, and he wanted his way and he didn't listen a whole lot.' Victim 9 testified last week that he was attacked by Jerry Sandusky in the basement of their home and cried out for help while Dottie Sandusky was upstairs - but she never responded. She said the basement was not soundproof and she would have been able to hear shouting if she were upstairs. Jerry and Dottie Sandusky were married in 1966, and have no biological children together. They adopted six times and were also foster parents. Back in court: Former Penn State University assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky arrives at the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte . Dottie Sandusky, who isn't charged in the case, also said the visiting boys were free to sleep upstairs if they wanted to. The accusers have said Jerry Sandusky directed them to the basement, where they allege he sometimes molested them on a waterbed that was in the room. Also Tuesday, a psychologist testifying for the defence in the Jerry Sandusky trial says the former coach has a personality disorder characterised by excessive emotionality and attention-seeking. Arrival: Dottie Sandusky emerges from a vehicle at the Centre County Courthouse, in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania . Elliot Atkins said that he interviewed Sandusky for six hours before diagnosing the ex-coach with 'histrionic personality disorder.' Atkins explained to the court that people with the disorder often interact with others in inappropriately seductive ways and don't feel comfortable unless they're the center of attention. Sandusky's attorney Joe Amendola is hoping to convince jurors that the disorder could explain his client's letters and other interaction that prosecutors allege shows his grooming of victims. 'Based on my evaluation of Mr. Sandusky, I have diagnosed a histrionic personality disorder,' said Atkins. The psychologist's testimony followed attempts . by defence lawyers earlier in the day to discredit the prosecution's . case by suggesting investigators had coached testimony from one of the . Sandusky's alleged victims. Sandusky . faces 51 counts of child molestation after the prosecution dropped one . charge of unlawful contact with minors on Monday. If convicted on all . counts, the former defensive coordinator for Pennsylvania State . University's successful football program faces a sentence of more than . 500 years in prison. The case has . focused renewed national attention on the issue of child sexual abuse . and prompted the firing in November of Penn State President Graham . Spanier and legendary head football coach Joe Paterno. Paterno died of . lung cancer in January. Leaving court: Jerry Sandusky and his wife Dottie left the courthouse in separate cars after the sixth day of the ex-coach's child sex abuse trial . The former defensive coordinator for the Penn State University football team, Sandusky, 68, denies all 51 counts of committing abuse. Atkins told the court that Sandusky's histrionic personality disorder definitely explained his grooming behaviour. He told the court that he spent six hours with the accused, read the personal emails he sent to some of the alleged victims and also read his autobiography, 'Touched.' In the case of Sandusky, Atkins outlined . that histrionic means 'dramatic' or 'theatrical' and that people with . the disorder need the approval of other people and act up and create . unusual situations to make sure they are the centre of attention. Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky arrives at the Centre County Courthouse . Atkins confirmed that people with this mental condition, 'might do something dramatic to draw attention to themselves.' This would include acting in a way that is 'inappropriately sexually provocative.' The defence move to highlight Sandusky's mental fragility comes after a string of prosecution witnesses, including eight alleged victims, testified that he groomed them and abused them while they were with his Second Mile charity for troubled children. The eight alleged victims, now men aged 18 to 28, . testified for the prosecution last week, describing in often graphic . detail being molested by Sandusky as boys, including oral and anal sex . and shared showers. Defense attorney Joe Amendola reacts to a question as he arrives at for the sixth day of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse trial in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania . Two other alleged victims have never been . identified. Many have criticised the use of this defence. 'This would be an incredible stretch - so much that it disturbs some of my colleagues that they are bringing it up,' said Gail Saltz, an an associate professor of psychiatry at New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine to MSNBC. 'This diagnosis has no bearing on your moral compass, your ability to understand what's legal,' she said. 'It has nothing to do with being a pedophile. It has nothing to do with sexual behavior toward children.' Earlier in the day, defense lawyers took aim . at law enforcement officers' testimony that they had not discussed abuse . accounts offered by fellow accusers with other alleged victims in the . closely watched case. Amendola . questioned Pennsylvania state trooper Corporal Scott Rossman and retired . trooper Joseph Leiter about a taped interview they held with one of the . accusers, known in court documents as Victim 4, and his attorney in . April 2011. The interview was . played in court and Leiter was heard saying to Victim 4 during a break . that investigators had interviewed about nine other potential victims. In some cases 'oral sex has taken place by both parties,' which would be . considered rape under state law, he said. Leiter . could be heard saying telling the accuser that his story 'word for . word' followed those of others. 'He has taken advantage of you. We need . you to tell us what happened,' Leiter is heard saying. Under . cross examination by a prosecutor, Leiter said he considered the . interview technique to be appropriate and never suggested to a victim . what he should say. It was the . second day of the defense case after the prosecution rested its case on . Monday. A still image from 'All my Children' which ran from 1970 to 2011 and was known for its outlandish plotlines . Judge John Cleland told jurors on Monday he expected closing . arguments to take place on Thursday. Two . university officials also face charges of perjury and failure to report . suspected abuse in an alleged incident involving Sandusky and a boy at a . Penn State locker room. Earlier Tuesday, defense attorney Joe Amendola  told reporters to 'stay tuned' to find out if Sandusky would take the stand himself, comparing the case to a soap opera. Asked which soap opera, defense attorney Joe Amendola initially said 'General Hospital,' then 'All My Children.' These dramatic developments came on the same day that TMZ released an unaired clip from the November telephone interview between Sandusky and Bob Costas during 'Rock Center with Brian Williams'. Satellite trucks are parked in front of the Centre County Courthouse as the sexual abuse trial of former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky . Speaking about the attention which he paid to the young boys under his care, Sandusky stopped short of denying that he ever sexually abused young children. 'I didn't go around seeking out every young person for sexual needs that I've helped.' NBC was criticised for not playing the clip back in November, but 'NBC Nightly News' hit back saying, 'There were a lot of compelling comments in the original interview but we did not have time to include them all.' Sandusky is charged with 51 counts involving 10 boys. He denies the allegations.

The Mid Bedfordshire MP insisted she would 'do it again tomorrow' as she was confronted by paparazzi photographers at Heathrow after viewers made her the first contestant to be booted out of I’m A Celebrity…. Get Me Out Of Here. But the outspoken Conservative contradicted party claims she had been suspended or summoned to a meeting with Chief Whip Sir George Young and claimed to have missed only three parliamentary days, despite the Commons sitting 11 times while she was away. Scroll down for video . Nadine Dorries arrived back in Britain today to face the music after her appearance on Iím A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! The Mid Bedfordshire MP used Twitter to express her alarm at the media scrum as she arrived back in Britain, and defended taking time off from Westminster . She told reporters she would 'do it all again' but said press reports about her were wrong. 'I’ve only taken three parliamentary days off,' she said. 'The whip has not been withdrawn, it’s incorrect.' She also denied she was set to have a meeting with Sir George. 'I’ve not been summoned for any meetings.' However, Tory HQ has repeatedly said they expect her to meet with party whips as soon as she returns to Westminster. Tonight a senior Conservative source said: 'When Nadine went to the jungle, she was suspended from the party, pending a meeting with the Chief Whip. Now a meeting can take place and I presume that meeting will take place soon. 'It is for her to meet with the Chief Whip and we will see what happens at that meeting. 'She will have to explain herself to the Chief Whip. She says she sought permission from the whips and received permission - the whips that were around at the time say that's not the case.' Mr Cameron has 'input' into decisions on party discipline, but it is for Sir George Young to restore or withdraw the whip, said the source.

The Mid Bedfordshire MP claimed she wanted to use her appearance on I'm A Celebrity to discuss political issues in front of a TV audience of millions . A Downing Street insiders today said she had been 'very clearly' informed in a letter that she was suspended pending a meeting. 'The Chief Whip will decide her fate after the meeting,' the source added. It is understood the meeting could take place as early as tomorrow, with Mr Cameron determined to send a clear message to other Tory MPs his unhappiness at her decision to swap Parliament for the Australian jungle. Before flying home, she took a swipe at critics in her own . party, claiming female MPs who condemned her for abandoning her . constituents were fuelled by ‘jealousy’. Ms Dorries had claimed she wanted to reach out to voters through the TV series, but she became the first celebrity to be dumped out of the jungle .

Instead of taking part in Commons debates, the Mid Bedfordshire MP was seen chatting with former darts champion Eric Bristow . Ms Dorries hoped to use the platform to discuss her policy concerns, but was instead seen fretting about the loud voice of TV chef of Rosemary Shrager . From the moment Ms Dorries arrived in Australia she has been the target of intense criticism from Tory colleagues, including several female MPs who accused her of making it harder for women to be taken seriously in politics. But in an interview before flying home, Ms Dorries was unrepentant when asked if she thought she would be frozen out on her return to Westminster. ‘Do I care? Why would I know? Why would I be interested in that? The word jealousy springs to mind actually,’ she told Iain Dale on LBC 97.3. ‘I know what’s happened.

"A family outing turned into a major archaeological discovery by one New Mexico 10-year-old who literally stumbled on a million-year-old fossil. 
  
 Jude Sparks was hiking the rugged New Mexico desert some five miles east of Las Cruces by the majestic Organ Mountains in November with his parents Kyle and Michelle and brothers, Hunter,8 and Rhett, 5. 
  
 Jude said he and his brothers were checking their hand-held radios when he tripped on something. 
  
 “I tripped on the bottom of the tusk and fell flat on my face,” Jude told Fox News. 
  
 LOCH NESS MONSTER REDUX? 'DINOSAUR-LIKE-CREATURE' REPORTEDLY SPOTTED IN NORTH CAROLINA LAKE 
  
 When he turned his head he was looking directly at part of what looked like a jaw bone. “It looked like large chunks of bone.” 
  
 Dusting himself off Jude quickly called Hunter who was nearer to the parents to come over to check out what he found. 
  
 The boys originally thought it looked like a large dark cow skull but when Kyle and Michelle arrived they knew it was something much more relevant than what is typically found in the desert. 
  
 Kyle said when he returned home he called Peter Houde, professor of Biology at nearby New Mexico State University. 
  
 ANCIENT LAND-DWELLING CROCODILE HAD T. REX SIZED TEETH, STUDY SHOWS 
  
 When Houde arrived at the site he was amazed at what young Jude tripped on. 
  
 “I think this is only the second full Stegomastodon skull found in the state of New Mexico,” Houde said. 
  
 There was another found at Elephant Butte State Park just north of Las Cruces about two years ago. 
  
 “That one lacks the jaw and it appears the ends of both tusks were broken off,” Houde told Fox News. “Ours includes the jaw but is missing one tusk so far - we may find it yet.” 
  
 DINO EXTINCTION ALLOWED FROGS TO CONQUER THE PLANET 
  
 According to Houde, there are only three nearly full Cuvieronius skulls, all of which were found in Bolivia in the early 1900's. He says this recent discovery is the most complete. 
  
 “Intact skulls of both of these are extremely rare and we've had unprecedented luck in obtaining the two,” Houde said of New Mexico’s unearthed prehistoric past. 
  
 He surmises the fossil Jude tripped over was unearthed by recent rains in the region but never the less, the irony of a youngster tripping over such a historic find while playing with his brothers is inescapable. 
  
 Houde said these mammoth animals are a primitive group of proboscideans ('elephantoids') from which modern elephants evolved. The recent discoveries are late-comers that were not ancestral to anything.

 “Ours would look pretty much just like modern elephants if they were alive today although the Cuvieronius had spiral tusks,” Houde said. “Their legs might be a bit stubbier, but the main difference from elephants is in their molar teeth, reflecting a diet more based on browsing than that of modern elephants.” 
  
 Fossils of these animals exist especially in the southern United States, down through Central America, and in some cases into South America, but they are pretty universally represented by very scrappy bits of bone, teeth or tusks. 
  
 “They simply break into small bits as they weather out of the sediment before they are found. The preservation of ours is truly unusual, but a great deal of that may be due to the fact that we were able to locate them while they were still deep underground,” Houde said. 
  
 Houde said the fossil is in remarkably good shape. The exposure through the dirt did a little damage to a tusk, but nothing that can't fix. The fact that the jaw and skull were found next to one another suggests that there could be, or could have been, other parts of the skeleton preserved not far away. 
  
 THE SUN MAY HAVE HAD AN 'EVIL TWIN' THAT WIPED OUT THE DINOSAURS 
  
 Part of the delay in releasing information on the find was obtaining permission from the landowner to excavate the site. Kyle said the university requested they did not release any information until all of the pieces were in place which wasn't until just recently. 
  
 Kyle said there was quite a bit of logistical coordination involved. He said he and Houde decided to cover the specimen with dirt until approval could be obtained. 
  
 “We intend to look but we will not be allowed by the land owner to dig willy-nilly without good geological information about where we will likely be successful,” Houde said. “I'm waiting for our geologists to return from summer field schools to look into it.” 
  
 Houde said he isn’t very optimistic, saying bones get scattered far and wide and even if they were only 5-10 feet apart that would entail a lot of earth moving given the topography of this location.

 A 10-year-old boy’s accidental discovery in the Las Cruces desert led a New Mexico State University professor to a rare, mostly intact 1.2 million year-old stegomastodon skull. 
  
 “I was running farther up and I tripped on part of the tusk,” said Jude Sparks, who had been hiking in the desert with his parents and testing walkie-talkies with his brothers when he came face-to-face with the fossil. “My face landed next to the bottom jaw. I looked farther up and there was another tusk.” 
  
  
  
 The Sparks family contacted NMSU biology professor Peter Houde in November after seeing him interviewed in a YouTube video about a similar fossil found several years ago in a Mesquite quarry about 10 miles south of campus. 
  
  
  
 “A stegomastodon would look to any of us like an elephant,” said Houde. “For the several types of elephants that we have in the area, this is probably one of the more common of them. But they’re still very rare. This may be only the second complete skull found in New Mexico.” 
  
  
  
 After the family contacted Houde, the jaw and two pieces of tusk were taken to the Vertebrate Museum at NMSU. In May, the family joined a team of students and professors who worked for about a week to carefully unearth the skull. 
  
  
  
 Houde explained it took some months to get permission to dig on the property from the landowner, who requested the site remain a secret. It also took time get the special chemicals needed to properly preserve the fossils. The College of Arts and Sciences provided funding for the process. 
  
  
  
 Houde applauded the Sparks family’s decision to do the right thing in contacting him about their find. He encourages others who might come across fossils to reach out to an expert rather than try to dig it up on their own. 
  
  
  
 “As you can imagine, when people find out about these things, they might be tempted to go out there and see what they might find themselves and tear up the land or they might hurt themselves,” Houde said. “To be quite honest, all these fossils from this area are radioactive and especially for children, not something you would want in your home.” 
  
  
  
 Houde estimates the jaw weighs about 120 pounds and the entire skull as little as a ton. And while the skull may appear to be strong, it is quite delicate. 
  
  
  
 “The upper part of the skull is deceiving. It’s mostly hollow and the surface of the skull is eggshell thin,” Houde said. “You can imagine an extremely large skull would be very heavy for the animal if it didn’t have air inside it to lighten it up just like our own sinuses. That makes the thing extremely fragile and the only thing holding it together is the sediment surrounding it. 
  
  
  
 “In fact when the sediments are removed from the sides of them, they start to fall apart immediately and literally fall into tiny, tiny bits. It has to be done carefully by somebody who knows how to go about doing it. It is a very deliberate process that takes a little bit of time.” 
  
  
  
 During the weeklong extraction process, 10 to 12 people helped at different times with the excavation of the stegomastodon skull. NMSU geology major Danielle Peltier assisted with painstaking process of gently brushing the last bits of dirt from the skull and tusk and applying chemical hardeners to ensure the ancient bones remained intact. Acting like plastics, the chemicals harden and restore the strength that would otherwise be present in the bone as protein. 
  
  
  
 “As we were brushing away the fossil as soon as we removed the sediment we needed to put a type of hardener on there to preserve the structural integrity, otherwise it would just crumble after a few days being left in the sun,” Peltier said. 
  
  
  
 Peltier, who will graduate in May 2018, plans to enter a Ph.D. track program and pursue a career as a paleontologist and academic. 
  
  
  
 “I’ve been fortunate to do field work in Las Cruces, at White Sands and in Kenya,” Peltier said. “It’s amazing to be able to travel, meet remarkable people and realize that you’re the first person to be looking at something that might be anywhere from 5,000 to 3 billion years old.” 
  
  
  
 After the skull was unearthed, the NMSU team carefully coated the fossil with plaster and placed wood braces to protect and support it. The skull was lifted from the dig site by a front-end loader and placed on a flatbed truck for the trip back to the university. 
  
  
  
 While the process to study and reconstruct the skull, jaw and tusks will take years to complete, Houde says the stegomastodon fossil will eventually go on display. 
  
  
  
 “I have every hope and expectation that this specimen will ultimately end up on exhibit and this little boy will be able to show his friends and even his own children, look what I found right here in Las Cruces.” 
  
  ||||| They sent an email to a biology professor at nearby New Mexico State University, Peter Houde. He recognized the find almost immediately: These were the remains of a long-extinct Stegomastodon, and Jude had tripped over its fossilized tusk. 
  
 Dr. Houde said he gets calls and emails about potential finds from time to time — often, they amount to nothing much. But this time, it was different. 
  
 “This is really very unusual to find,” he said, explaining that prehistoric remains are so fragile that they typically disintegrate shortly after erosion exposes them to the elements. The Sparkses simply got lucky by visiting the site shortly after strong rains had exposed the fossil. 
  
 When Dr. Houde and the Sparks family visited the remains one day after Jude’s discovery, they made sure to bury them again. After months of arranging a team, getting money and securing a permit, the skull was finally excavated in May. 
  
 The creature it belonged to lived at least 1.2 million years ago, Dr. Houde estimated. 
  
 Some have described Jude’s find as a dinosaur discovery, but it’s not. The Stegomastodon was an elephantine creature — not a mastodon, but similar in appearance — whose existence was relatively recent. It walked the earth within the last few million years and may have even been hunted by humans. |||||","– Luck came not once, but twice for Jude Sparks. The then-9-year-old was lucky enough to trip not on a rock, or a tree root, but on a 1.2-million-year-old fossil when trying to dash away from his brothers on a November desert hike with his family. And as New Mexico State University biology professor Peter Houde explains to the New York Times, Jude was lucky to have been at the Las Cruces, NM, site just after a storm had exposed the fossil—but before the exposure reduced the specimen to nothingness. At first he and his brothers thought it might be from a cow; his parents thought it looked more elephant-like. Their research didn't turn up a clear answer, so they turned to Houde, who identified it as part of a stegomastodon skull. Jude's parents actually weren't that far off. The Times notes the stegomastodon was not a dinosaur (non-avian dinosaurs were wiped out way more than 1.2 million years ago, after all), and Houde says in a university release that the creature ""would look to any of us like an elephant."" Fox News gets more scientific, explaining they're ""a primitive group of proboscideans ('elephantoids') from which modern elephants evolved."" The skull was excavated in May and marks what Houde says may be just the second-such full skull found in the state. Houde credits the Sparkses for their restraint in not digging up the bones but rather consulting a professional. He adds, ""To be quite honest, all these fossils from this area are radioactive and especially for children, not something you would want in your home."" (A 4-year-old found this dinosaur.)"

Top cop: Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo talks to reporters Friday about new leads in the Graham case . Officers scoured Matthew's the building in search of evidence all day Friday . Chief Tim Longo, of the Charlottesville PD, had identified a dreadlocked man — now identified as Matthew — as the ‘person of interest’ in the hunt for Graham. He was spotted in surveillance footage with his arm round her waist before apparently vanishing in his car together, police said on Friday. Police believe he bought the underage girl an alcoholic drink and have 'every reason to believe' that she was with him when he left 15 minutes later in his 1998 burnt orange Chrysler coupe. The car was searched and seized by police after it was found parked outside a housing complex on Hessian Hills Way, where Matthew lives. Officers spent most of Friday scouring through Matthew's apartment just outside Charlottesville, located about 3 miles from the Downtown Mall where Graham was last seen. Longo told MailOnline that investigators were carrying out a 'forensic . search' of the two-bedroom apartment in Hessian Hills Way, Albemarle . County. 'They will be looking for blood, hair, fibers, the things we are interested in these kind of cases,' he told MailOnline. ‘We’re interested in him,’ Longo added to reporters. ‘We’re interested in talking to him, we’re interested in his interactions with Hannah.’ Law enforcement officials have been issued with multiple warrants for properties within Charlottesville. Details of the warrants remain sealed on the orders of a judge, and will remain secret for up to 180 days, unless the judge changes the ruling. Chief Longo described the finding of Matthew's apartment as a 'big break' in the case. He later tempered his declaration by saying, 'I would hope that is is.'

"(CNN) -- Move over Disney -- a Nigerian animator has produced an educational cartoon to teach youngsters about African culture. Tired of African children watching only imported cartoons that didn't reflect their lives, Nigerian animator Adamu Waziri decided to do something about it. His creation is ""Bino and Fino,"" a cartoon aimed at three to five year olds, about a brother and sister who live with their grandparents in an unnamed African city. ""I want to create a brand that's as good as Dora the Explorer, Charlie and Lola, quality wise, made in Nigeria, that is educational, and also shows positive aspects of Nigerian/African culture, not just to Nigerian or African kids but to kids everywhere,"" says Waziri. The pilot episode celebrated Nigeria's Independence Day and looked at the issue of colonialism. The cartoon has also had segments teaching the numbers one to 10 in the Nigerian Igbo and Yoruba languages. He adds that he wants the program to ""teach kids and show that the stuff you see on TV of starving people isn't the only thing (in Africa) -- you have a middle class here who have the same aspirations as everybody else."" See also: Meet the Afropolitans . Bino and Fino isn't the only children's cartoon produced in Africa. ""Tinga Tinga Tales,"" for example, is made in Kenya for the BBC, while ""Jungle Beat"" is produced in South Africa and has been shown internationally. But both cartoons, like many set in Africa, tell stories about the continent's exotic animals. Waziri was determined to do something different. ""I said I'm not going do African folk tales, animals -- that's what you get in (animated movie) 'Madagascar' -- we don't want to do that,"" he says. ""We want to show a couple of kids in a middle class life, which I know isn't the reality of all the kids in Africa, but let's show that reality -- the reality of people using laptops, phones, going to school, doing their daily business -- no talking ants, no dancing 'jinga jinga' music -- just a cartoon of life."" Two full-length ""Bino and Fino"" episodes have been shown on a channel on Sky TV in the UK, where Waziri says it has been well received. The next step is to attract the funding and sponsors needed to get the cartoon aired in Nigeria. It takes Waziri and his core team of four a month and a half to produce a single episode of Bino and Fino, which is just eight minutes of animation. His says the slow turnaround is off-putting for sponsors in Nigeria, where feature-length Nollywood movies are often produced in a matter of weeks. See also: Nigerian blockbusters for internet generation . Waziri adds that when it comes to entertainment, some Nigerians have a mindset of ""West is best,"" but he is determined to change people's minds by showing it's possible to make a credible homegrown alternative to imported programs. He believes that it's not enough for Africans to complain of being underrepresented in foreign cartoons, or misrepresented by international media -- they must also do something about it. ""People complain that Africa is not represented well in the media,"" says Waziri. ""I understand that, but my point is Nigeria and other parts of Africa aren't poor, you have businessmen, the infrastructure, the ability to link up and make studios, finance it and sponsor it and make the market -- stop waiting for Disney to do it, do it yourself.""","Nigerian cartoon ""Bino and Fino"" aims to teach children about African history and culture .

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . An airline passenger is lucky to be alive after he  suffered a mid-air heart attack during a long-haul flight and was saved by three fellow travellers. The man was midway through a flight from Canada to Hong Kong when he complained of chest pains and his heart suddenly stopped beating. Luckily, a doctor, a pharmacist and a policeman trained in first aid were all on board and, with the help of crew, kept him alive. A man suffered a heart attack while flying from Canada to Hong Kong last month, but his life was saved by a doctor, a pharmacist and a policeman who were on board . He has now made a full recovery in a case which is being used as an example of why portable defibrillators should be carried on all flights. The dramatic incident, which happened last month, came to light  after the doctor involved reported it to the British Medical Journal, which called the episode 'a remarkable story of survival against all the odds'. Dr Dave Monks, an anaesthesiologist who has worked at the Royal Free Hospital in London, said the man was taken ill  hundreds of miles from the nearest airport in some of the most remote airspace on earth. Dr Monks said the man  told him of striking pains moving from his chest to his head. The passenger then lost consciousness and had no pulse, causing Dr Monks to ask other passengers for help. Luckily, a pharmacist who had worked in an intensive care unit and a trained policeman came forward and, using a portable defibrillator, they gave the man an electric shock to get his heart pumping again. The doctor involved said the incident highlighted the importance of having defibrillators on flights and in training as many people as possible in how to use them . When the man's health again deteriorated, the brave trio kept him alive using adrenaline from the plane's medical kit. The pilot of the aircraft then landed in Beijing, China and the man was rushed to a nearby hospital. Remarkably, he was discharged 10 days later having made a complete recovery. Dr Monks told Live Science: 'This guy was extremely fortunate to have this team there. 'These guys just happened to be on the plane and even with the [basic medical skills] they had, they were able to perform a quite dramatic and sophisticated critical care resuscitation.' He said the episode shows the importance of keeping defibrillators on passenger planes and training people in first aid. He cited research that shows people are more likely to have heart attacks on flights due to stress, disturbed sleep patterns and lower levels of oxygen. One study suggests about 1,000 passengers per year experience sudden cardiac arrest while on flights.","Man on flight from Canada to Hong Kong complained of chest pains .

 Agents and New York police arrested Luis Alomar, 37, around 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, the agency said in a statement. It didn't provide details of where he was arrested in the Long Island community or how he was located. 
  
 The FBI had sought the public's help Monday in finding Alomar, who is suspected of robbing 20 banks in New York, New Jersey and Delaware.

 A suspect in a series of bank robberies along the Eastern Seaboard was arrested in Medford early Tuesday, the FBI said. 
  
 Fugitive Luis Alomar, 37, was taken into custody at about 2:30 a.m., the FBI's New York field office said in a news release. He is currently being held on state parole violations at the Suffolk County Jail, said Christios Sinos, a supervisory special agent at the FBI. An arraignment had not yet been scheduled, he said. 
  
 The release said that police from Suffolk County, Westchester, Yonkers and Greenwich, Conn., assisted in the arrest, as did the New York State Division of Parole. 
  
 The release did not provide details of the arrest or Alomar's arraignment information, and the agency did not immediately respond to an email seeking more information. 
  
 The FBI had issued a news release on Monday, warning that Alomar -- who has ties to the Mastic and Shirley areas -- was wanted and could be armed and dangerous. 
  
 A federal arrest warrant had been issued for Alomar in Delaware for bank robbery, and he is a suspect in several more, including ones in New York and New Jersey, the FBI said Monday. 
  
 The FBI did not specify the locations of the robberies. 
  
 In addition to ties to Long Island, Alomar also has ties to southern Florida, specifically Palm Beach County, as well as Kissimmee in Osceola County. 
  
 He has used aliases, including Arturo Alomar, Luis Arturo, David Diaz, David Gonzalez, Louis Alomar and Luis Castillo, the release said. |||||","– The FBI has captured a man they believe is responsible for roughly 20 bank robberies along the East Coast. Luis Alomar, 37, was arrested at about 2:30 this morning in the Long Island community of Medford, Newsday reports. Police didn't give any details on the arrest, but did say that a host of local police departments helped out, as did the New York State Division of Parole. Authorities had yesterday said they suspected Alomar might be hiding on Long Island, warning that he could be armed and dangerous. He allegedly flashed a gun during some of his robberies, warning he would shoot tellers if they said anything, CNN reports. In most cases he simply slid a note to cashiers that told them he was armed, according to the Long Island Press."
"The actor interviewed Mexico's most wanted drug lord in October in northern Durango state, at a meeting organised by Mexican actress Kate del Castillo.
The security forces came close to catching Guzman shortly afterwards.
They finally arrested him on Friday in a raid in which five people died.
Attorney General Arely Gomez said the security forces had been following Guzman's lawyer, who led them to Sean Penn and Mexican actress Kate del Castillo.
Who is 'El Chapo' Guzman? - The crime lord had humble beginnings.
Who is Kate del Castillo? - Actress was instrumental in arranging the interview
Did Sean Penn break the law? - Unusual interview raises questions in the US and Mexico
Penn's 'El Chapo' interview scorned - It has been called ""grotesque"" and ""maddening""
El Chapo extradition 'could take year' - American officials want Joaquin Guzman back in the US.
Kate del Castillo had been contacted by Guzman's lawyers years earlier after she had addressed Guzman in an open letter asking him to stop trafficking in drugs and start ""trafficking in love"" instead.
Ms Gomez said that following his escape from a maximum-security jail in July, Guzman again contacted del Castillo through his lawyers to ask her to produce a film about his life.
Del Castillo has not commented but in an article for Rolling Stone magazine, Penn said the actress had put him in contact with the fugitive drug lord.
They both then travelled to a remote mountain hideout where Penn proceeded to interview Guzman.
Ms Gomez said that meeting had provided them with important intelligence and helped them track down the fugitive.
""It was an essential element, because we were following [Guzman's] lawyer, and the lawyer took us to these people and to this meeting,"" she told local radio.
Mexican newspaper El Universal published photographs on Monday which suggest Penn and del Castillo were under surveillance by the authorities at the time.
The Associated Press news agency asked Penn if he was worried about the images. He wrote back in an email, saying: ""I've got nothin' to hide"".
Guzman's escape in July 2015 - his second from a maximum-security jail - was a major embarrassment for the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto.
But on Monday, the authorities proudly showed journalists around the house Guzman had been hiding in in Los Mochis.
It feels like a voyeuristic journalism package holiday. The marines flew us here and showed us around the house that the feared criminal escaped from.
""Over there you can see how the cans burst from the force of the grenades,"" an official from the attorney general's office pointed out in the kitchen.
""And over here, this was the spot where the second person died,"" he said pointing to a patch of blood measuring about two metres by two metres.
In one room was a walk-in wardrobe with a floor-length mirror. You would never have guessed it was actually a door, but behind it was a narrow set of stairs leading to a tunnel.
It was through this tunnel that Guzman managed to escape. But this time it was not for long, as the marines got wise to his signature escape route and hunted him down a few hours later on a nearby highway.
President Enrique Pena Nieto praised the security forces for the arrest of ""the world's most wanted criminal"" in a brief televised speech on Monday.
""With this action, 98 of the 122 most dangerous criminals no longer pose a risk to society,"" he said. ""We're going after all of them!""","Mexico's Attorney General has said that the meeting between Hollywood actor Sean Penn and fugitive cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman had been an ""essential"" element in his arrest."
"Kenneth Harper, 33, was convicted of the sex crimes last year, along with further charges of assault and reckless behaviour, after a high court trial.
Judges at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh quashed his convictions for the two rape charges after defence arguments about mutual corroboration.
He was given a three-year sentence for the remaining offences.
Solicitor advocate John Keenan challenged the rape convictions, which were based on mutual corroboration.
That meant the evidence of one allegation was being used to support the other.
Mr Keenan said there were only two alleged offences and there was a substantial time gap between them of almost eight years.
He said the circumstances in which they were said to have occurred were different and there was an absence of ""extraordinary features"".
He argued that there must be something compelling to link events separated by many years, but here there was nothing.
The Crown claimed that there were compelling similarities as both offences involved vulnerable women who were significantly younger than Harper, the first was aged 15 and the second 22.
It also argued that evidence from a third woman, who was assaulted, could be used to support the convictions.
Lord Brodie, who heard the appeal with Lord Bracadale and Lady Cosgrove, said: ""Long lapse of time does not preclude the finding of sufficient similarity between two incidents to infer a course of conduct, but it is relevant.
""Where the interval is a long one it is necessary to consider whether there are any extraordinary features in the evidence that nonetheless make the similarities compelling.
""The time interval, at a little short of eight years, was long. Accordingly for the Crown to be able to link the two alleged incidents it must be able to identify some special feature. There was no such feature in the present case.""
Harper had originally been jailed at the High Court in Glasgow after being convicted in Aberdeen.",A Shetland man jailed for seven years after a double rape has had his convictions quashed on appeal.
"Tom Colicchio has changed the name of his hot Beekman Hotel restaurant Fowler & Wells to Temple Court after realizing the first moniker has a racially charged past. 
  
 The chef said in a statement: “In the mid-1800s, the building where the Beekman . . . now stands housed the offices of Fowler & Wells, a pair of publishers and phrenologists.” 
  
 Phrenology is the study of skull size and structure to determine mental abilities, and was often used as a justification for discrimination and slavery. 
  
 After picking the name, Colicchio and his team “dove more deeply into the works of Fowler & Wells” and “discovered facts about their beliefs that go against everything we stand for.” ||||| Phrenology really was used to justify slavery, as portrayed in Django Unchained. But it was also used to justify abolition 
  
 ""Why don't they kill us?"" asks Calvin Candie, the southern slave owner in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained. He wants to know why the African slaves he brutalises do not rise up and take revenge. Before long, he has the skull of a recently deceased slave on the dinner table. ""The science of phrenology,"" he announces, ""is crucial to understanding the separation of our two species."" He hacks away at the back of the skull with a saw, removing a section of the cranium and pointing to an allegedly enlarged area. In African slaves, Candie claims, this bump is found in the region of the brain associated with ""submissiveness"". 
  
 For Candie, phrenology not only explained slavery, it justified it. 
  
 Needless to say, phrenology has now been thoroughly debunked: the idea that the shape of the skull can be used to infer mental characteristics is just plain wrong. But it was extremely popular all over the world during the 19th century, finding converts among reform-minded Bengalis in Kolkata, India, and colonial settlers in Australia. As part of my research into the global history of phrenology, I came across the real-life Calvin Candie. 
  
 He was called Charles Caldwell, a doctor from Kentucky who revelled in both phrenology and slave ownership. As in the film, Caldwell was a Europhile, travelling to Paris in the 1820s where he picked up the latest medical craze. He later returned to France in the 1840s in order to hobnob with Pierre Marie Dumoutier, a phrenologist just back from a three-year round-the-world voyage.

 At the time, Dumoutier's immense collection of skulls and casts could be found at the Musée de Phrénologie in Paris. There Caldwell could practise phrenology, feeling for bumps on the heads of Tahitians and Marquesas Islanders. No doubt he was considered very à la mode back in Kentucky. In fact, Caldwell even boasted of being one of the earliest experts in phrenology in the United States. 
  
 Caldwell deployed phrenology in almost exactly the same manner as the fictional Candie. In 1837 he wrote to a friend claiming that ""tameableness"" explained the apparent ease with which Africans could be enslaved. This was a standard phrenological argument. Areas located towards the top and back of the skull, such as ""Veneration"" and ""Cautiousness"", were routinely claimed to be large in Africans. His correspondent concurred, writing: ""They are slaves because they are tameable."" Clearly enjoying himself, Caldwell replied: ""Depend upon it my good friend, the Africans must have a master."" 
  
 Areas for 'veneration' and 'Cautiousness' were said to be large in Africans. Photograph: Alamy 
  
 It's worth emphasising that these words are not from a Tarantino script, crafted for Hollywood shock value. They were written by a slave owner desperate to preserve his brutal way of life. And, while the physical violence of slavery is masked in Caldwell's letters, they betray his warped sense of morality. In a letter written on Christmas Eve 1838, Caldwell made the outrageous claim: ""My slaves live much more comfortably than I do."" 
  
 The fact that phrenology was used to justify slavery is perhaps unsurprising. What would one expect from such an overtly racist science? But it wasn't just the slavers. My research revealed that some of the most vocal anti-slavery campaigners of the 19th century were also advocates of phrenology, and used it to justify their stance. 
  
 Lucretia Mott, a particularly uncompromising American abolitionist, sent her children to phrenological lectures and spoke of the ""truth of phrenology"" in letters to friends. When she visited Britain she stayed with the renowned Scottish phrenologist George Combe, himself an anti-slavery campaigner. Horace Mann, another major figure in abolitionist politics, was so keen on phrenology that he subscribed to the official journal. After becoming president of Antioch College in Ohio, he even boasted in the same sentence that the professors he employed were both ""anti-slavery men"" and ""avowed phrenologists"". 
  
 Photograph: public domain 
  
 These are not isolated examples. If anything, the majority of phrenologists were against slavery. 
  
 How can this be? George Combe, a man whose phrenological books sold more copies during the 19th century than Charles Darwin's Origin of Species, explained his reasoning: ""The qualities which make them submit to slavery are a guarantee that, if emancipated and justly dealt with, they would not shed blood."" 
  
 For abolitionists, the apparent weakness and timidity of the Africans served two purposes. It countered fears that they would take revenge on their masters if set free. It also provided a moral argument: if Africans were innately weak, society should help them, not enslave them. 
  
 In the 19th century, scientific racism and abolition were by no means mutually exclusive. |||||","– A celebrity chef has spent tens of thousands of dollars to quietly change the name of his Manhattan restaurant after he discovered its meaning had racial undertones. Per the New York Times, Tom Colicchio, the lead judge on Bravo's Top Chef, originally called his eatery in the New York City's financial district Fowler & Wells, named after publishers Samuel Wells and brothers Lorenzo and Orson Fowler, whose building rested on the same site as Colicchio's restaurant in the mid-1800s. However, a little digging by Colicchio's team after they'd already named the restaurant revealed ""facts about [the Fowlers' and Wells'] beliefs that go against everything we stand for,"" per a statement cited by Page Six. More specifically, the Fowlers and Wells were advocates of phrenology, the study of the shape and size of the skull, which many in the 19th century believed to be an indicator of one's mental abilities—and which was often used to ""prove"" African-Americans were mentally inferior and to justify slavery (at least one of the Fowler brothers had eyebrow-raising thoughts on this). Colicchio, who's an outspoken liberal on social media, said that although his team incorporated the concept of phrenology into the restaurant's theme (including on the bar's menu), they didn't initially realize quite how bad the practice's roots could be. Once they made this discovery, they went about coming up with a new name and reworking logos, signage, business cards, and menus to match. The restaurant's new name: Temple Court, named after the building it's housed in."
"(CNN) -- Protesters in parts of Egypt rallied Friday against the government and a vote on a constitution that would ban religious parties, leading to clashes with security forces or demonstrators' opponents in at least three cities, Egyptian media reported. The demonstrations are the latest by members or supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that has regularly protested Egypt's interim government since Brotherhood-backed President Mohamed Morsy was ousted in a coup in July. Muslim Brotherhood supporters clashed with opponents in parts of Cairo after Morsy loyalists tore down posters supporting the proposed constitution, on which Egyptians will vote Tuesday and Wednesday, the semiofficial Ahram Online news outlet reported. In Giza, security forces fired tear gas at Morsy supporters to disperse their march there, Ahram Online reported. The demonstrators began to march after Friday prayers and clashed with police in various parts of the city, Ahram Online said. Clashes also broke out in al-Sabah city in Suez province, where security forces fired tear gas at a pro-Morsy march, according to the state-run Middle East News Agency. The Muslim Brotherhood-led National Alliance to Support Legitimacy had called for protests, MENA said. The alliance has focused its ire on Egypt's January 14-15 referendum on a new constitution, which would not only ban religious parties but also put more power in the hands of the military. The alliance has called for a boycott of the referendum. Muslim Brotherhood supporters have continued their protests, even though the government declared the group a terrorist organization last month. The government has threatened to arrest anyone who attends Muslim Brotherhood protests or provides financial support to the organization. Supporters of the organization demand the reinstatement of Morsy, who became the country's first democratically elected president in 2012, and the full restoration of their political and social rights. The interim government blames the group for coordinated attacks on churches and government facilities, including a recent bombing of a police headquarters that left 16 dead and more than 100 injured. The military ousted Morsy on July 3 after he was accused of pursuing an Islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government. Morsy's supporters say that the deposed president wasn't given a fair chance and that the military has returned to the authoritarian practices of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed in a popular uprising in 2011. Morsy is awaiting trial in several cases, including one in which he and 14 other Muslim Brotherhood members face charges stemming from December 2012 protests over a constitution he shepherded into effect. Egyptian authorities have accused Morsy and his staff of ordering supporters to attack protesters after guards and members of the Interior Ministry refused to do it. Morsy and four others are charged with inciting violence, but they are not accused of using force. Eleven others are charged with killing three men, torturing 54 people, using force and possessing weapons. That trial, delayed Wednesday, is expected to resume on February 1. Morsy, who says he still is Egypt's legitimate president, has refused to recognize the court's authority and has yet to accept legal representation for the proceeding. CNN's Jason Hanna, Sarah Sirgany, Saad Abedine and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Islamist group supporters protest an upcoming vote on a new constitution .

"Mountaineering Scotland wrote a joint letter with the Scottish Gamekeepers Association.
It asked for upland moors to be protected from commercial tree-planting.
The letter to the environment secretary was prompted by the Scottish government's draft Climate Change Plan.
It sets a target of increasing forest cover from 17% to 25% of the land mass by 2050.
Following the letter, many Mountaineering Scotland members have said they support the planting of native species and describe the moorland as a man-made habitat.
Others have questioned the group's association with gamekeepers.
The outdoors writer and TV presenter Cameron McNeish wrote on Twitter: ""Disagree with #Mountaineering Scotland over {the} issue of woodlands.  Shocked they have got into bed with moorland owners.
""My own preference would be for reducing deer and sheep numbers to allow natural regeneration, not planting. Growth can be incredibly fast.""
BBC Scotland revealed on Wednesday that the joint letter had been sent to the Scottish government.
The letter states: ""Our concern is whether adequate weight is being given to the significant changes this will have on the landscape of Scotland and in particular the dramatic open views and vistas which have come to signify to the outside world that which is unique about our country.""
Responding to the criticism, chief executive David Gibson said: ""Mountaineering Scotland welcomes the passion shown by our members and others but regrets that our position has been substantially misunderstood and has caused concern to members.
""The feedback has strengthened our resolve to take a stronger stance on conservation issues, including hill tracks and land management practices.
""Our collaboration with the Scottish Gamekeepers Association was on a single issue and does not indicate agreement with them on any other policy or issue.""
Mountaineering Scotland, formerly the Mountaineering Council of Scotland (MCofS), issued a clarification on Thursday saying they were not opposed to the planting of native trees.
Outdoor writer Chris Townsend said: ""Having read the clarification, I have to say as a member and an ex-president of the MCofS I think it's pathetic, disappointing and naive.""
But Reforesting Scotland, a charity which promotes tree planting, backed the underlying call for a government policy on upland moors.
A spokesman told BBC Scotland: ""Scotland's upland landscape is largely a man-made construct caused by deforestation and maintained that way through excessive grazing and burning for the benefit of a few.
""There is a need to protect areas of valuable moorland but not at the level it exists at present. The balance is wrong and we need to bring all interested parties together to decide where that new balance should lie.""
Professor Dominick Spracklen, of the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds, said: ""The distinction between plantation forestry and native woodlands is absolutely critical to this discussion - open, patchy native woodlands do not have the impact on ""grand vistas"" that dense plantation forestry does.""
Citing Glen Affric, Glen Strathfarrar, Glen Feshie and Beinn Eighe, he added: ""These are iconic landscapes - a mix of native trees, moorland and mountain - that are much more interesting than they would be if they had no trees. The clarification from the Mountaineering Council recognises this.""
The Scottish government's draft Climate Change Plan includes planting more trees because forests can act as a carbon ""sink"", removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
A spokesman said: ""The increased woodland creation targets announced by the Scottish government as part of its Climate Change Plan will be taken forward in a sustainable way, including working closely with a range of stakeholders.
""This will include appropriate consideration of Scotland's distinctive upland landscapes.""",A group that represents climbers and hill walkers has experienced a backlash from its members over its objections to new forestry targets.

When he announced his intention to run in the Australian state of Victoria he said he had learned from his time living in Britain that 'every election needs a comedy candidate,' reported The Age. His campaign slogan was 'vision, passion and change,' and he publicised his message with adverts, T-shirts, and a stream of public appearances.

 NEW YORK (AP) — Over his career, former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson recorded 50 wins and six losses. But he recently notched another big loss in Latin America — this time as a coach of a bird. 
  
 Tyson traveled to Suriname as part of the new Fusion TV documentary series ""Outpost "" and was soundly beaten when he entered a bird in a songbird contest, a cherished local tradition. 
  
 Cameras captured Iron Mike as he learned about the contest, located a bird to enter — he dubbed the tiny guy ""Little Mike"" — but then suffered a TKO when a competing champion cheeped and peeped more than his bird did in the same 15-minute period.

 Pope Francis named Boston’s Cardinal O’Malley, a psychotherapist, and four women—one of them raped by a priest—to deal with child abuse in the Catholic Church. 
  
 Some things are worth the wait. At least that is the hope when it comes to Pope Francis’s surprisingly well-rounded new commission appointed to deal with the ongoing priest sex abuse problem in the global Catholic Church. The commission, announced Saturday by the Holy See press office, is made up of four women, one of whom is a victim of sex abuse by a priest, and four men – only three of whom are clerics. 
  
 The highest-ranking church official on the commission is Cardinal Sean O’Malley who was a front-runner in the papal conclave that finally elected Pope Francis a year ago. 
  
 The other clerics are an Argentine priest Pope Francis shepherded through the Jesuit ranks in his home country and a German priest who is also a licensed psychotherapist. According to Vatican spokesperson Father Thomas Rosica, the Argentine, Humberto Miguel Yáñez, is a professor of moral theology who spearheaded the Symposium on the Sex Abuse of Minors two years ago. German Hans Zollner leads the Centre for Child Protection at the Institute of Psychology of the Pontifical Gregorian University. 
  
 The more surprising members of the group are the female members. Marie Collins is a married Irish woman who was raped at the age of 13 by a priest. She is an activist for child safety within the Catholic Church and has been vocal about how she was snubbed by her local parish and told to “protect the priest’s good name” when she accused him. Francis also appointed noted French psychologist Catherine Bonnet, who has written extensively about child sex abuse, and Baroness Sheila Hollins from the United Kingdom who is an expert in mental health. 
  
 In what is seen as a nod to the late Pope John Paul II, Francis also named the Polish ambassador to the Holy See, Hanna Suchocka, who is a constitutional law professor and former prime minister of Poland and the winner of several awards for her work on human rights. 
  
 The group’s final member is Italian canon law professor Claudio Papale, who specializes in crimes against morality. The Vatican was quick to point out that Papale, Collins and Hollins are all married. 
  
 Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said that the announcement of the new commission, coming after Friday’s highly publicized prayer vigil against organized crime and before the beginning of Easter celebrations was by design. “Pope Francis has made clear that the Church must hold the protection of minors amongst her highest priorities,” Lombardi said in a statement. “This initial group is now called to work expeditiously to assist in several tasks, including: participating in the deliberations concerning the Commission’s final structure; describing the scope of its responsibilities; and developing the names of additional candidates, especially from other continents and countries, who can offer service to the Commission.” 
  
 The announcement follows stark criticism of Pope Francis for dragging his heels on this extremely controversial issue. Writing in the Boston Globe, Vatican expert John Allen points out an interview Francis gave to an Italian newspaper in which he actually defended the church’s record on abuse, saying the Catholic Church “is perhaps the lone public institution to have moved with transparency and responsibility . . . yet the church is the only one to have been attacked.” 
  
 The comment prompted an angry response from victims and a document dump by the group Bishop Accountability, which tracks errant bishops who shuffle predator priests from parish to parish for their protection. The group cited Francis’s record in five alleged abuse cases when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires. According to the database, “he released no documents, no names of accused priests, no tallies of accused priests, no policy for handling abuse, not even an apology to victims.” ||||| Cardinal Sean O'Malley was among eight people, including four women, named by the pope to a panel to guide the Vatican’s anti-abuse inquiries. 
  
 Pope Francis on Saturday named Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley of Boston and seven other figures with reputations as reformers to guide a new Vatican antiabuse commission, a move intended to demonstrate resolve about confronting the child sexual abuse scandals that have rocked Catholicism. 
  
 O’Malley, already the lone American on the pope’s “G8” council of cardinal advisers, is also the lone American among the commission members announced Saturday. O’Malley’s new responsibility is not a full-time position, meaning he will not move to Rome and will continue to serve as the archbishop of Boston.

 The lineup for the new Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors also includes Irish laywoman Marie Collins, who has said she was raped at the age of 13 by a hospital chaplain. When she tried to report the abuse years later, she said, she was told by church officials that “protecting the good name” of the priest was more important than remedying a “historical” wrong. 
  
 Collins has acquired an international reputation as a campaigner for the rights of abuse victims.

 The pope tapped three clergy and five laity, including four women. The panel’s members come from eight countries, with seven from Europe or the United States. 
  
 Though early reaction suggests some critics of the church’s response to the abuse scandals see the announcement as a public relations exercise, a Vatican spokesman said it reflects the late Pope John Paul II’s statement that “there is no place in the priesthood or religious life for those who would harm the young.” 
  
 In a sign of personal interest, Pope Francis also named a fellow Argentine and Jesuit priest, the Rev. Humberto Miguel Yáñez, who was received by the future pope into the Jesuit order in 1975 and who studied under him at an Argentine Jesuit college. He is seen as having direct access to the pontiff.

 The other members announced Saturday are: 
  
 ■ The Rev. Hans Zollner, a German Jesuit and the academic vice rector of the Gregorian University in Rome and head of its Institute of Psychology. Zollner coordinated a major antiabuse conference in Rome in 2012 called “Toward Healing and Renewal.” 
  
 ■ Hanna Suchocka, a former prime minister of Poland and Poland’s former ambassador to the Vatican. 
  
 ■ Claudio Papale, an Italian lay expert on church law who teaches at Rome’s Pontifical Urbaniana University. 
  
 ■ Catherine Bonnet, a French child psychologist who has written widely on the effects of sexual abuse and exploitation on children. 
  
 ■ Baroness Sheila Hollins, a former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and current president of the British Medical Association who has frequently consulted on child development issues in the United Kingdom. 
  
 People not authorized to speak on the record told the Globe that Francis chose not to issue a legal document providing a structure and mandate for the new commission, preferring to allow the people he has put in charge to work out those details. The initial group will also make recommendations to the pope for additional members “from various geographical regions of the world.” 
  
 While plans originally called for the antiabuse body to be housed within the Vatican’s powerful Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Saturday’s announcement suggests it will have a more independent profile reporting directly to the pope. 
  
 The announcement comes at a time when Francis had been facing mounting criticism for a perceived blind spot on the abuse scandals. 
  
 In early March, the pontiff gave an interview to an Italian newspaper in which he seemed defensive about criticism of the church’s record, saying it “is perhaps the lone public institution to have moved with transparency and responsibility . . . yet the church is the only one to have been attacked.” 
  
 Just days later, the American advocacy group BishopAccountability.org released records purporting to show that the future pope had failed to act aggressively on five cases involving priests accused of abuse in Argentina, though only one of those priests was actually ever under his direct authority. 
  
 People who were not authorized to speak on the record said Francis took a personal interest in the makeup of the antiabuse commission, phoning subordinates in the Vatican in order to work out the timing of the announcement. 
  
 The Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, the main American advocacy group for victims, released a statement Saturday welcoming the choice of Collins but voicing suspicion that the commission “will be more about public relations than real change.” 
  
 “Catholic officials have concealed child sex crimes for centuries and still are concealing child sex crimes,” the statement said. “They do not need yet another ‘Study Commission.’ The pope must take strong steps right now to protect kids, expose predators, discipline enablers, and uncover cover-ups.” 
  
 In part, Francis’ choice of O’Malley may reflect that he is the American cardinal closest to the pope, being the only one to have stayed in Francis’ residence in Buenos Aires before his election. In part, however, it also probably reflects that the Boston prelate has one of the most complete résumés of any senior church official in dealing with the abuse crisis. 
  
 His experience began in the Fall River, Mass., diocese in 1992, where he took over amid a scandal centering on the Rev. James Porter, who was convicted of molesting 28 children and confessed to abusing at least 100 over a 30-year period. In 2002, O’Malley moved to Palm Beach, Fla., where he followed two different bishops who resigned after acknowledging offenses against minors. 
  
 One year later, O’Malley succeeded the controversial Cardinal Bernard Law in Boston, eventually settling more than 100 abuse claims against the archdiocese and touting a “zero-tolerance” policy. He has led penitential liturgies apologizing to abuse victims around the world and called for new procedures to hold bishops accountable if they fail to respond aggressively to abuse claims. 
  
 While SNAP calls O’Malley’s record, including his refusal to issue a complete list of names of accused Boston priests, “deeply flawed,” the archdiocese on his watch has gone from the global epicenter of the abuse crisis to a venue seen in many Catholic circles as an example of essentially successful recovery. 
  
 O’Malley declined a Globe request to speak about his role on the commission beyond what was in the Vatican announcement. In an early February interview with the Globe, however, O’Malley discussed the commission and Francis’ broader approach to the abuse crisis. 
  
 “He’s certainly aware of how serious this issue is,” O’Malley said of the new pope at that time. “I don’t think he has a plan yet for how to deal with it.” 
  
 O’Malley suggested that one important function of the new commission might be working with national-level conferences of bishops around the world to ensure that they have all implemented antiabuse guidelines. 
  
 The aim of that effort, he said, is “to have some clarity about what the expectations are throughout the world.” 
  
 O’Malley also suggested that the commission might be able to make progress on what many critics charge is the most serious piece of unfinished business from the crisis, which is holding bishops accountable if they fail to apply the church’s official “zero-tolerance” policy. 
  
 Critics point, for instance, to Bishop Robert Finn of Kansas City, Mo., who was found guilty in September 2012 of a misdemeanor charge of failure to report a priest accused of abuse and yet remains in office. Finn was acquitted of a second charge. 
  
 “I hope this commission will help the church develop protocols, so there will be a very clear path to follow” in such cases, O’Malley said. He added that it would likely not be the commission’s job to investigate individual cases, but rather to help develop procedures the pope can apply when charges arise that a bishop has failed to respond appropriately. 
  
 The new commission is expected to meet two or three times a year, with members staying in touch by phone and e-mail in the meantime. ||||| VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis named the initial members of a commission to advise him on sex abuse policy Saturday, signaling an openness to reach beyond church officials to plot the commission's course and priorities: Half of the members are women, and one was assaulted by a priest as a child. 
  
 The eight members were announced after Francis came under fire from victims' groups for a perceived lack of attention to the abuse scandal, which has seriously damaged the Catholic Church's reputation around the world and cost dioceses and religious orders billions of dollars in legal fees and settlements. 
  
 The Vatican in December announced that Francis would create the commission to advise the church on best policies to protect children, train church personnel and keep abusers out of the clergy. But no details had been released until Saturday and it remains unknown if the commission will deal with the critical issue of disciplining bishops who cover up for abusers. 
  
 In a statement, the Vatican hinted that it might, saying the commission would look into both ""civil and canonical duties and responsibilities"" for church personnel. Canon law does provide for sanctions if a bishop is negligent in carrying out his duties, but such punishments have never been imposed on a bishop for failing to report a pedophile priest to police. 
  
 The eight inaugural members include Marie Collins, who was assaulted as a 13-year-old by a hospital chaplain in her native Ireland and has gone on to become a prominent campaigner for accountability in the church. 
  
 Also named was Cardinal Sean O'Malley, one of Francis' key advisers and the archbishop of Boston, where the U.S. scandal erupted in 2002. 
  
 Two other members are professors at Rome's Jesuit Pontifical Gregorian University, which in 2012 hosted a seminar for bishops from around the world to educate them on best practices to protect children. Several participants from that conference are now founding members of Francis' commission, including Baroness Sheila Hollins, a British psychiatrist. 
  
 During that 2012 conference, Collins told the bishops of her own ordeal, of the hospitalizations, anxiety and depression she endured after Irish church authorities didn't believe her when she reported her attacker, and then blamed her for the assault. 
  
 ""I was treated as someone with an agenda against the church, the police investigation was obstructed and the laity misled. I was distraught,"" Collins said at the time, calling for bishops to be held accountable when they don't report abusers to law enforcement. 
  
 The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said the institution of the commission was evidence that Francis believed ""the church must hold the protection of minors among her highest priorities."" 
  
 But in a March 5 interview with Corriere della Sera, Francis appeared defensive about the issue, complaining that the church had been unfairly attacked. 
  
 He acknowledged the ""profound"" wounds abuse leaves and credited Pope Benedict XVI with turning the church around. Benedict in 2001 took over handling abuse cases because bishops were moving pedophiles around rather than punishing them. In his final two years as pope he defrocked nearly 400 abusive priests. 
  
 But Francis then added: ""The Catholic Church is perhaps the only public institution that has moved with transparency and responsibility. No one has done more. And yet the church is the only one that has been attacked."" 
  
 Collins' appointment to the panel was hailed by Dublin Archbishop Diarmuid Martin, who has clashed both with the Vatican and his fellow bishops in demanding greater accountability and honesty about abuse. SNAP, the main U.S. victim's group also praised her inclusion but said the pope doesn't need another study panel, he just needs to oust complicit bishops. 
  
 ""He's had more than a year to defrock, demote, discipline or denounce even one of them,"" said SNAP's outreach director Barbara Dorris in a statement. ""But, just like his predecessors, he refuses to take this simple but crucial step toward justice, healing and prevention."" 
  
 The initial group named Saturday will define the scope, statutes and priorities of the commission and propose other members to better reflect the church's geographic diversity. 
  
 Other members include: 
  
 —Catherine Bonnet, a French consultant in child and adolescent psychiatry. 
  
 —Claudio Papale, an Italian canon lawyer and official of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which handles sex abuse cases. 
  
 —Poland's recently departed longtime ambassador to the Vatican, Hanna Suchocka, a constitutional lawyer. 
  
 —The Rev. Humberto Miguel Yanez, an Argentine Jesuit who studied with Francis as a seminarian and currently is head of moral theology at the Gregorian. 
  
 —The Rev. Hans Zollner, the vice-rector of the Gregorian, a Jesuit psychologist and psychotherapist who organized the Gregorian seminar and also serves on the German government's roundtable on child abuse.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea became the first defending champion to crash out at the Group Stage of the Champions League -- despite thrashing Danish side Nordsjaelland 6-1 at Stamford Bridge. The win was Chelsea's largest in the competition, but it still wasn't enough to prevent them slipping into the Europa League. Rafa Benitez's side needed Shakhtar Donetsk to do them a favor and defeat Juventus, but the Italian team triumphed 1-0 in Ukraine. That meant that Chelsea's victory was meaningless, despite the margin of victory. It looked as if the Blues would endure a difficult evening when Nordsjaelland was awarded a penalty on 32 minutes. But Chelsea keeper Petr Cech saved well from Nicolai Stokholm to keep the game goalless. Just minutes later, it was Chelsea's turn to miss from the spot when Eden Hazard's effort was saved. Chelsea collapse heaps pressure on Benitez . Any frustration around Stamford Bridge was finally extinguished when the home side was awarded another penalty following a handball and David Luiz swept home. Fernando Torres netted a second on the stroke of halftime before Nordsjaelland halved the deficit through Joshua John. But the Blues steamrolled the Danes in the second period with Torres grabbing his second, before Hazard, Juan Mata and Oscar completed the rout. In the end, it was Olexander Kucher's 56th minute own goal in Ukraine which sealed Chelsea's demise and Juventus' place in the knockout phase. Both Shakhtar and Juve only needed a draw to progress with the Ukrainian side already guaranteed of a place in the last-16. But the Italians secured victory and top spot with a hard-fought win. Barca's unbeaten run ended by Celtic . In Glasgow, Celtic secured a dramatic 2-1 win over Spartak Moscow to secure second place in Group G. Kris Commons netted an 81st minute penalty to seal the three points and ensure the Scottish champion leapfrogged Benfica. Gary Hooper's strike had given Celtic the lead before Spartak struck back through Ari six minutes before the break. But when Marek Suchý was adjuged to have brought down Giorgos Samaras, Commons blasted the ball home from 12-yards to spark wild celebrations. Spartak's misery was compounded when Kim Kallstrom was sent off for a wild tackle on Commons. Benfica and 'the curse of Bela Guttmann' Meanwhile, Benfica was left to think of what might have been after finishing goalless at Barcelona. The Catalan side left out a whole host of star names including Xavi and Andres Iniesta, while Leo Messi started on the bench. Messi map: How Argentine maestro conquered the world . Messi, who still needs two goals to beat Gerd Muller's record of 85 goals in a calendar year, did come onto the field after 58 minutes, but was forced off on a stretcher after suffering an injury late on. But despite Barca fielding a relatively inexperienced side, Benfica was unable to find a way through and must now settle for the Europa League. Bayern Munich share points with Dortmund . In Group F, Bayern Munich secured top spot with a comfortable 4-1 win over 10-man BATE Borisov. Mario Gomez gave last season's finalist a 22nd minute lead with Thomas Muller adding a second. Xherdan Shaqiri grabbed Bayern's third before BATE was reduced to 10-men when Denis Polyakov was shown a second yellow card. David Alaba hammered home a fourth with seven minutes remaining, before Yegor Filipenko hit an 89th minute consolation. Valencia was forced to settle for second place following its 1-0 win at Lille courtesy of Jonas' 36th minute penalty. In Group H, Galatasaray pulled off a crucial 2-1 win at Braga to book its place in the next round. Mossoró had given the Portuguese side a 32nd minute lead as Galatasaray's hope began to fade. But top scorer Burak Yılmaz equalized with his sixth goal of the competition, before substitute Aydın Yılmaz hit the winner. It was hard to swallow for Romanian side Cluj, which recorded one of the most famous results in its history to win 1-0 at Manchester United. Luis Alberto's stunning strike ensured Cluj became the first Romanian team to triumph at Old Trafford.

"The Grade I listed buildings at Cannington Court have been restored over the past three years.
Staff will use the base to develop skills in smart metering, new nuclear projects, finance and human resources.
Chief executive officer Vincent de Rivaz, said: ""We are committed to developing the new skills and ideas to build a low-carbon society.""
Cannington Court is owned by Bridgwater College and has been leased to EDF Energy.
When it is not used by EDF staff, the college will make use of the facilities for its students.
EDF has used sustainable energy sources, such as ground source heat pumps and solar panels, to provide 50% of the building's power.
At the scene, BBC business correspondent, Dave Harvey:
On the face of it, a new training centre for a multi-national company is not big news.
For the staff and the managers, it was certainly a big day in Cannington, as the French chief exec drove into Somerset with a government minister to do the honours. But for the rest of us?
Well the opening of EDF's new national training centre is significant, for two reasons. One, it underlines the company's commitment to Somerset. As Vincent de Rivaz told me, they want to bring staff from Scotland, Suffolk and the South East to learn nuclear technology in Cannington.
It matters also because it demonstrates how confident EDF was that Hinkley C would be approved. Vincent de Rivaz approved the multimillion-pound hub four years ago, before Hinkley C even had planning permission. He knew there were hurdles, but he never doubted it would go ahead.
We are now told Hinkley C's final investment decision, the absolutely last green light, will come before Christmas. Mr de Rivaz is clearly losing no sleep over that decision.
Cannington Court was also previously a Catholic industrial school for boys and an agricultural college.
Last month, EDF Energy confirmed it had reached an agreement with Chinese state-run energy firm China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) on their level of investment for a nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point.
Although CGN has confirmed it will pay Â£6bn towards the cost, EDF has not yet announced its final investment decision.
Once this is confirmed the nuclear build will go ahead but, due to the long delays in the project, the plant will not be generating power in 2023 as initially planned.
Anti-nuclear campaigners say the nuclear build deal is over-priced and will result in higher electricity bills for consumers. They also say nuclear power is unsafe and unsustainable.","A 12th Century Benedictine nunnery in Somerset has opened as a new training hub for the energy firm, EDF Energy."

"The actor son of the legendary star Dennis Hopper is accused of raping a 15-year-old girl after luring her to his home with promises of a 'casting couch' photo shoot. The unidentified girl is suing Henry Hopper for damages 'in the millions of dollars' for allegedly assaulting her several times after plying her with drugs and alcohol in April 2011. The teen's new lawyer, Jeff Herman, claimed to MailOnline on Monday that Hopper traded on his father's fame to convince her to go to his house after the pair met on Facebook via mutual friends. Family ties: Henry Hopper, left, is the son of late actor Dennis Hopper, right, seen together in 2008 . Mr Herman is taking over the lawsuit after it was initially filed last year and has not yet gone to trial. 'He said, ""Let's take photos of you"" and he used the to entice her to see him,' Mr Herman alleged to MailOnline. Mr Herman claimed the then-20-year-old Hopper promised to snap modeling pictures of her and to use his fame to help her. The girl, now 17 years old, met Hopper on Facebook via mutual friends in 2011. Mr Herman said it's a classic . 'casting couch' scam that is used all over Hollywood to lure . unsuspecting girls and young women into sex. Henry Hopper's agent refused to comment about any of the allegations facing the actor when asked by MailOnline. Up and coming: Henry is seen in 2011 with his costar Mia Wasikowska for the film 'Restless' After meeting online, the lawsuit . alleges, the two began messaging back and forth in spite of the fact . that he was five years older than she was. Mr Herman says that after communicating electronically, . they eventually agreed to meet at Hopper's house. He paid for a cab to . pick the girl up and drive her to his home in April 2011. When she arrived, he gave her unspecified 'non-narcotic' drugs and alcohol, and that is when the sexual assault occurred. 'Over . about the next 10 months, there were more incidents in which Hopper . again had Jane Doe brought to his house, furnished her with drugs and . alcohol, and then raped her,' the lawyer said in a press release. 'These . encounters were initiated through sexual Facebook messages from Hopper . to Jane Doe. These sexual messages included, among other things, a . request that Jane Doe send him photos of her so she can “pleasure him . from afar”; and being into a “school girl vibe” when “doin the nasty” with Jane Doe.' Mr Herman said his client reported . the allegation to police, but that the investigation remains open and . Hopper was never charged with a crime. Claims: The girl says that she was 15-years-old when a then-20-year old Henry repeatedly raped her (Henry seen here with his father in 2009) The teen says her life 'fell apart' after the attack. She lost her friends and had to be hospitalized . several times for mental health issues. Despite this, Mr Herman says, she went back to Hopper's house several times and maintained a sexual relationship with him. 'He continues to contact her and for a while, she had nothing - this was the only thing she had,' he said. Mr Herman said she was a 'compliant . victim' at that point - but maintains Hopper was taking advantage of her . fragile mental state. The teen's mental and emotional problems continue to this day, he added. Henry Hopper is an actor who appeared in 'Tree of Life' and Gus Van Sant's 'Restless,' both in 2011. His father Dennis died at the age of 74 in 2010, following a battle with prostate cancer. He was known for cult classics such as Easy Rider, Apocalypse Now and Blue Velvet.

The opening page of the report, which was written by independent public-health specialist Dr David McCoy, warns that its contents should not be ‘quoted or disseminated’ and are strictly for ‘limited circulation’. The report says the closures involve ‘a significant shift of health care activity and expenditure’, to be achieved by closing A&E wards and ‘a reduction in the number of hospital beds’. Dr McCoy writes: ‘A potentially more serious issue than the closure of A&Es is the reduction in number of hospital beds by nearly 25 per cent .  .  . However, details of the clinical rationale and modelling used to arrive at the proposal are absent.’ He adds that ‘any shortcoming in the plans to compensate for this by strengthening and improving out-of-hospital care will have serious consequences for patients and families’. None of the hundreds of bed closures in North-West London – mostly acute beds along with 20 paediatric and maternity – are explicitly mentioned in a 78-page consultation document supplied to local residents. 'Putting lives at risk': Campaigners argue hospitals are currently operating at full capacity and community services are already at breaking point . Dr John Lister, director of campaign . group London Health Emergency, described the plans as ‘shockingly . irresponsible’. He said: ‘This is being smuggled through without proper . debate. The consultation document told local people and health . professionals only part of the story, and kept key details tucked away . in obscure documents. We urge a reopening of consultation and a proper . debate with all the facts on the table.’ In . South-East London, a special administrator appointed by the Government . to oversee changes at South London Healthcare NHS Trust, which is close . to bankruptcy, has highlighted the need to close hundreds of beds. The information is on page 54 of Appendix K of the administrator’s draft report and reveals there should be 618 bed closures by 2017 – 15 per cent of the current total. This includes 173 at Lewisham Hospital and 224 at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust. However, a spokeswoman for Guy’s and St Thomas’ denied there were any plans to close beds. Documents from a consultation in Trafford, Greater Manchester, show similar plans. The ‘pre-consultation business case’ says: ‘Hospital beds required by the population of Trafford are reduced and those beds are replaced by the extended supported care in the community.’ At Barts Health NHS Trust in East London, bed numbers are forecast to drop by 21 per cent by 2016-17. Elsewhere in the Trust, Newham University Hospital will lose 72 beds and Whipps Cross University Hospital 138. Karen Reissman, a nurse and Unison representative from  Bolton, said plans to reorganise health services in Manchester would also include bed losses, despite the public consultation  literature failing to explicitly mention such changes. She said: ‘They’re saying 25 per cent of  people in hospital do not need to be treated in hospital. It’s all about affordability, and it’s shocking.’ Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘This reveals the full extent of the risks being taken with patient care. Hospitals are sailing dangerously close to the wind. Ministers must take urgent action to ensure patient safety.’ Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘Changes should happen with patients, not simply to patients. The Government’s decision to drive through £20 billion of NHS savings is having a real impact on care. They need to rethink.’ A spokesman for NHS North West London denied the figures had been ‘hidden’, adding: ‘The figures are all given in the document and explained in detail in the appendix. We have published all these  figures on beds in 73,000 distributed copies of our consultation plan – to which we received over 17,000 responses. Modern health care means people can be better supported at home.’ A spokesman for the Health for North East London consultation, representing King George Hospital, said the bed losses could be revised lower but ‘significant reductions’ were planned. He said: ‘These relate to efficiency gains. They are not a consequence of the A&E changes. The Trust needs to bring itself back into financial balance and in line with national benchmarking around length of stay.’","Some areas could see the number of hospital beds cut by 25 per cent .
The plans suggest GPs playing a larger role providing care in the community .
The number of patients treated in hospital will be restricted, with care increasingly provided by GPs or other services in the community.
In North-West London, almost 800 beds – one in four – could be lost across nine hospitals.
King George Hospital in Ilford, Essex, could see its capacity cut from 387 beds to just 47 in a few years.
In South-East London, 618 beds are to be scrapped across seven hospitals over the next five years.
There are also plans to slash beds in other parts of London and Manchester, but the scale of these cuts is yet to be revealed. There are likely to be similar reductions in bed numbers across the UK."
"By . Matt Lawton . Follow @@Matt_Lawton_DM . Gareth Bale is talking about positioning. More specifically, about getting into better positions more often to score more goals. It is a part of his game he would like to improve and what, you might ask, is so unusual about that when this is a player already reflecting on so many goals for Real Madrid? Well it’s the fact that this is the same player managers once regarded as a left back. A player, it is worth reminding ourselves, who once had to battle with Benoit Assou-Ekotto for a place in the  Tottenham team. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Gareth Bale speak ahead of the Champions League final . Dream start: Gareth Bale is hoping to win the Champions League during his first season at Real Madrid . Defining moment: Bale celebrates scoring Real's winning goal in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona . Finding his feet: Bale has shone since his £85million move from Tottenham last summer . Harry Redknapp saw the value in pushing him further forward,  eventually deploying him on the left wing and unleashing a talent that took the Champions League by storm. The 24-year-old is now ready to play in a European Cup final on Saturday, when Carlo Ancelotti’s side face Atletico Madrid in Lisbon. Since arriving in Spain he has been christened ‘The Cannon’, and it is a nickname that captures the sometimes spectacular nature of his goals. But to this observer none has been more spectacular than his 20th of the season; the goal that secured the Copa del Rey against Barcelona. We knew Bale was quick. But it is hard to recall a more impressive demonstration of pure pace on any pitch than the burst he mustered to take him past Marc Bartra after the Barca defender had knocked him into touch. That goal is seen as the defining moment of Bale’s first season abroad. ‘I scored a similar goal for Wales maybe six weeks beforehand,’ said Bale, who was speaking at an EA Sports 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil event. ‘I was just focused on the ball but if I am in a sprint with someone I fancy myself. It was great to score the goal. It was important to win the first trophy of the season. It gave us a lot of confidence.’ It is a quiet confidence that appears to be at the root of Bale’s success. A confidence that has  enabled him to take the move to Madrid in his stride. On the run: Bale skips away from Bayern winger Franck Ribery at the Allianz Arena . Star man: Wales winger Bale features in EA Sports' official 2014 Brazil World Cup game . Silverware: Bale celebrates the first trophy of his career with former Spurs team-mate Luka Modric . When he arrived, much was made of how he might operate alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. Whether the  finest player in English football could exist in harmony with the  finest player in the world. But Bale credits Ronaldo with being a reason why his has been such a smooth transition. ‘Cristiano has been very supportive,’ said Bale. ‘From the first day I came in, he has been there for me. On day one he gave me advice on the best areas to live and stuff like that. ‘We talk a lot; have a good  relationship on and off the pitch. I’ve learned a bit of everything from him. The way he plays and gets himself into certain positions; it’s a chance to learn off one of the best players in the world. Hopefully, that will improve me as a player.’ It is at this juncture that he mentions that area where he feels he needs to improve — scoring goals. ‘I don’t think there’s anything specific,’ he said. ‘It is more my all-round game, positioning-wise. I need to get myself into more goal-scoring positions. Influential: Bale admits he is learning 'a bit of everything' from Cristiano Ronaldo . Getting along: Bale says his relationship with Ronaldo is flourishing on and off the pitch . Fans' favourite: Bale has endeared himself to Madrid's fans with 15 La Liga goals in his first season . ‘Every year I try to keep improving and I tell myself that if I keep working hard I will get better.’ To be part of the team that wins La Decima — Madrid’s 10th European Cup — would be special. ‘It would be a dream to win it,’ said Bale. Nothing makes a footballer feel more settled than success on the field. As Bale said: ‘The time was right to go to Madrid. I am really glad I did it. I am trying to embrace everything, trying to enjoy the ride. It was also important to not only have some friends over but some family as well. I have got a great team around me. ‘I always had confidence in my ability and the fact we are now chasing the 10th title, against our city rivals, is very exciting. ‘Madrid has a real buzz about it. It’s football mad at the best of times but there’s a real sense of anticipation.’ EA SPORTS 2014 FIFA World Cup is OUT NOW on Xbox 360 and PS3. Watch Gareth Bale's World Cup Dream here .

"By . Katy Winter . PUBLISHED: . 08:57 EST, 8 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:56 EST, 8 April 2013 . A mother of eleven children has told how she feels misrepresented by a TV documentary after she and her husband were portrayed as pub-goers who live on takeaways. Amanda and Tony Allan of Sunderland starred in the Channel 4 programme '16 Kids  and Counting', which highlights the lives of big families. After filming with the production company Lion Television for eight months, Amanda, 42, a former auxiliary nurse, was shocked when the programme was aired recently. Pictured (L-R) James, 13, Isobelle, 4, Katie, 16, Charlotte, 8, mum Amanda, 42 with Thomas, 15 mths, Tony, 46 with Lacey, 2, Abigail, 10, Laura, 18, Lillie, 5 and Daniel Selvey, 19 . She said: 'They recorded us on holiday in August, and down at Seaburn beach,' 'The crew would come up for days and film us doing the school runs, and me cooking meals. 'Then when it was edited, all it showed was us at the local pub - which we wouldn't call our local - having takeaways and buying socks' 'They said that the Welcome Tavern is our favourite venue, but we haven't even been going in that long because we only moved here a few months ago. 'I've never said it was my favourite venue, and we don't even go out very much.' Amanda, who has six children from her first marriage, and five to second husband of seven years, Tony, said last Tuesday's documentary portrayed their city in a bad light and focused on moments of filming that didn't reflect their real lives. Amanda said: 'I thought it would show how well we cope with a big family and how well behaved our children are. 'My friends have said seeing us on holidays and how we manage would have been more interesting. Amanda, has six children from her first marriage, and five to second . husband of seven years, Tony who featured with her in the documentary . 'I feel like they heard Tony ask me about having another baby, and hooked the whole programme on that. 'They focused on me making that decision - I have now decided I will try for another - and my 16-year-old daughter Katie saying she didn't want me to. 'My 18-year-old, Laura, who was on the show with her fiance Daniel Selvey, jumped in to say that my kids would like me to have another, but they cut that out, and she was really annoyed. 'They said it would be a heart warming documentary about every day life, I don't think it was that at all. 'We haven't said anything to Channel 4, but me and Tony have said to each other that we don't think we would be in it again.' When contacted, a spokesman for Channel 4 said: 'The documentary is a fair and accurate portrayal of what programme makers experienced during filming with the family. 'The family saw the film prior to transmission and said they were happy with it.'","The Allan family starred in a Channel 4 programme '16 Kids and Counting'

They start the European leg of the tour by playing Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on 5 and 6 June.
Zayn Malik quit the group last week after flying back to the UK, having been ""signed off with stress"".
It was after reports that he'd cheated on his 21-year-old fiancee, Perrie Edwards.
He told The Sun that he was ""upset"" for the group's fans and he said there was no bad blood between him and his former bandmates, who he said had been ""really supportive"".

"By . Chris Pleasance . Her sculptures may be wooden, but artist Stefanie Rocknak's creations are anything but lifeless as these beautifully detailed pictures show. From a cyclist with veins standing out on his arms, to a face contorted in fear, Rocknak, who is also a professor of philosophy, hand carves each figure when she is not busy in the classroom. While a basic design can take just a few days to complete, more detailed work can take anything up to a month and a half to finish. Sculptor Stephanie Rocknak takes anywhere between a few days and a month and a half to create wonderfully detailed wooden designs such as this one, called The King . Made from two pieces of basswood, one for the body, head and crown, and another for the hands, The King was displayed in the windows of Saks on 5th Avenue, New York . The figure, which was completed in February 2008, was inspired by exhibits in the National Portrait Gallery in London, and the National War Museum in Warsaw, Poland . This piece, The Queen, was finished in August 2010 and designed as a counterpart to The King. The figure is also made from basswood, and her crown is made from many pieces slotted together . Her work has been exhibited all over the world, and a statue of Edgar Allan Poe she designed will take pride of place in Edgar Allan Square in Boston after it is unveiled in October. The brass figure beat 265 other entries from 42 and 13 countries to win the commission, and is designed to look as if Poe has just stepped off the train to visit his parents. Her sculptures have also been displayed in the Smithsonian, the windows of Sak's on 5th avenue, and in the Mariner’s Museum, on the Hudson River Sloop. Rocknak can spend up to 1,000 hours getting the details of a sculpture just right, such as the delicate floral designs which run down The Queen's sleeves and the garlands around her neck . The Biker sculpture was created from two pieces of wood in 2005 and was one piece in a three-part commission called The Triathlete, which included a runner and a swimmer . The arms on the rider show the level of detail that goes into Rocknak's work, with his veins, sinewy muscle and wristwatch all painstakingly carved out . Rocknak was artistic from a young age, . training as a painter, before travelling to Rome in 1987 where she was . inspired by the likes of Michelangelo, Dontatello and Bernini and turned . to sculpture instead. While she intended to become a stone sculptor, she started working in wood first as her mother used to refurbish wood furniture, her father was a carpenter, and her grandfather had a wood shop in his ship yard. She always intended to start using stone, but fell in love 'the warmth and unpredictability of the wood,' and never went back. The Swimmer was part of the same commission. Speaking about the work, Rocknak said she was interested in capturing people in motion, as she found posed characters uninteresting . The Swimmer was carved from a single piece of wood and formed part of a three-part collection, which included The Rider. The third part, The Runner, was a huge runner's leg, also made from basswood . Rocknak says her art is deliberately simple to understand, and aims to be visually rich and detailed rather than intellectually complex or conceptual . Steering . away from modern 'conceptual' art which Rocknak says is often . overly-complex, she aims to create figures which are 'immediate and . obvious; ideally, they do not need a theory to do their talking.' One . of her commissions, The Triathlete, featured three figures including a . bike rider, a swimmer and a giant runner's leg to represent the three . stages of a race. At . the time she was creating the work, Rocknak said she preferred creating . figures in motion as she found 'posed' figures uninteresting. Rocknak says she was inspired by stone masters such a Michelangelo and Donatello but chose to work in wood as her father was a carpenter and her mother used to repair wooden furniture . Rocknak also uses her talents to capture human emotions in wooden sculptures. This piece is simply called Terrified and captures a wide-eyed woman with her head thrown back in fear . This work, called Ghastly Nights, captures a woman's fear and frustration which keep her awake .","Stefanie Rocknak is professor of philosophy at a New York college .

"By . Damien Gayle . Arrested: Fugitive Kazakh oligarch Mukhtar . Ablyazov, who was held in France after special forces backed by armoured vehicles . swooped on his rented home . French police special forces called in airpower and armoured vehicles for an operation to seize a wealthy fugitive Kazakh oligarch wanted in three countries over a $5billion bank fraud. Mukhtar Ablyazov was held after paramilitary police swooped on a rental home in the town of Mouans Sartoux, near Nice in south-east France, said Solange Legras, chief prosecutor at an appeals court in Aix-en-Provence. The police used 'powerful means'  - . including armoured vehicles and a plane - because Ablyazov was known to . have a 'private militia' at his disposal, said Ms Legras, whose office . focuses on international cases. In the event, no shots were fired during the operation. The 50-year-old is wanted in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan over a string of allegations of fraud and organised crime. He disappeared from the UK in February 2012 just before a British court sentenced him to 22-months in jail for contempt of court in a financial fraud trial. He was subsequently stripped of assets worth more than £150million in British assets, including an £18million mansion in one of London's most exclusive streets. Ablyazov, who has been wanted by Interpol since 2009, was held on allegations of 'large-scale fraud in an organised group', Ms Legras said by phone, shortly after meeting with Ablyazov to explain the possible extradition process. A former energy minister in his home country, Ablyazov later emerged as a prominent opponent of Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled the energy-rich Central Asian nation since before the Soviet collapse. Shortly after setting up a pro-reform party in 2001, Ablyazov was sentenced to six years in prison for abuse of public office. However, he was pardoned by Mr Nazarbayev and released in 2003, vowing to stay out of politics - a promise he broke by funnelling money to the opposition. Kazakhstan's prosecutors have . described Ablyazov as the head of an extremist, criminal conspiracy bent . on 'seizing power by inciting civil strife and hatred.' He is wanted . there on charges of siphoning off at least $5billion from BTA Bank, . which based in the central Asian country's business capital, Almaty. The . prosecutor in Astana, the Kazakh capital, said Interpol had informed . the government of Ablyazov's arrest, which was carried out at the . request of Ukraine, where he is wanted on charges of alleged . embezzlement of funds from a local branch of the BTA bank. He is also . sought by Russia in connection with embezzlement charges involving BTA . bank and a Russian company. Dissident: A former energy minister in his home country, Ablyazov later emerged as a prominent opponent of Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled the country since before the Soviet collapse . There was no extradition request from the UK, where Ablyazov was in February 2012 convicted of contempt of court after attempting to hide the extent of his wealth from a legal action taken by the now state-owned BTA bank in the hope of recovering some of the allegedly embezzled funds. Mr Justice Teare, sitting in the High Court, said Ablyazov was accused of 'fraud on an epic scale' and had committed 'deliberate and substantial' contempts by breaching an asset-freezing order imposed to stop money vanishing before litigation concluded. The conviction was upheld at the Court of Appeal last November, where senior judge Lord Justice Maurice Kay said Ablyazov had shown 'rare cynicism and deviousness' as he fought the claims against him and ordered him stripped of assets worth more than £150million. Mr Ablyazov’s property portfolio in Britain is alone worth more than £63million. His Bishops Avenue property — Carlton House — is worth £17million and is in a street nicknamed Billionaires' Row. The mansion has a 50ft ballroom and a Turkish bath, and is one of several he bought in a spree financed allegedly using fake loans, backdated documents and offshore accounts. He also has a £1m apartment in Albert Court, closet to Lord's cricket ground; and Oaklands Park - a 100-acre estate on the edge of Windsor Great Park with tennis courts and helicopter pad. In a statement on his Facebook page, . Madiyar Ablyazov, the former banker's son, said he feared what would . happen if his father were deported to Kazakhstan. 'We . beg the French authorities not to grant Kazakhstan our father. He is a . man of honour, who has been fighting all his life, and sacrificed so . much, for freedom and democracy in Kazakhstan,' the younger Ablyazov . wrote. 'We are afraid for his life.' Taken: Ablyazov's mansion in Hampstead, which has a 50ft ballroom and a Turkish bath, is one of several he bought in a spree financed allegedly using fake loans, backdated documents and offshore accounts . Ablyazov's arrest came after the deportation of his wife and young daughter from Italy to Kazakhstan caused a political crisis in Rome last month. Because France has no extradition agreement with Kazakhstan, Ms Legras, the Aix-en-Provence prosecutor, said she is focusing on the extradition request from Ukraine for now. Under the extradition process, the requesting country has 40 days to send its legal dossier to French authorities. Once that is received, French prosecutors will have five days to present Ablyazov to investigating magistrates. 'In my opinion, this isn't going to happen before the autumn,' she said. The managing director of BTA Bank today told MailOnline the company welcomed Ablyazov's arrest. Pavel Prosyankin said: 'This arrest is a result of the Bank’s diligent efforts through the British justice system to recover the billions of dollars he stole while Chairman. 'We have sought his arrest to prevent him from further dissipating assets which the English High Court ordered to be put in receivership. 'He has flouted many court orders and fled the UK after we secured another High Court judgment sentencing him to prison in England. 'He is now in custody and we are optimistic that we will be better positioned to recover more of the assets which the court has authorised us to seize.' Ablyazov denies wrongdoing and says the allegations are politically motivated.","Mukhtar Ablyazov was held after paramilitary police yesterday swooped on his rented home in the south of France .

"By . Damien Gayle . Edging slowly out of her dry dock at Barrow-in-Furness, this is the third of the Astute class submarines that will take the Royal Navy's fighting capabilities into the 21st Century. The 97m long, 7,400 tonne nuclear-powered attack submarine Artful has cost taxpayers more than £1billion but, along with its sisters, sets a new standard in weapons load and stealth. Armed with both Spearfish heavy torpedoes and Tomahawk cruise missiles, Artful's design marks a shift away from a Cold War focus on anti-submarine warfare to a concept of 'Maritime Contributions to Joint Operations'. Scroll down for video . Artful, the third highly-complex Astute class submarine designed and built by BAE Systems for the Royal Navy, appears outside her construction hall for the first time . Facts and stats: Armed with Spearfish torpedoes and Tomahawk cruise missiles, Artful's design marks a shift away from a Cold War anti-submarine warfare . The Tomahawk cruise missiles she will carry are claimed to have an accuracy of just a few metres over a range of within 1,240 miles, giving Artful the ability to support ground forces anywhere in the world. More than 39,000 acoustic tiles mask the vessel's sonar signature, meaning she slips through the seas with less noise than a baby dolphin. Yet her sonar is said to be so powerful it can detect ships leaving harbour in New York City from a listening point below the waters of the English Channel, 3,000 nautical miles away. Artful got her toes wet for the first time yesterday, more than 24 hours after she first emerged from the Devonshire Dock Hall in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. She was officially named last September by Amanda, Lady Zambellas, wife of the Royal Navy’s First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas. Stealth: More than 39,000 acoustic tiles mask Artful's sonar signature, meaning she will slip through the seas with less noise than a baby dolphin . Hunter: Yet her sonar is so powerful it can detect ships from 3,000 nautical miles away - equivalent to the distance between the English Channel and New York . Expensive: The 97m long, 7,400 tonne nuclear-powered attack submarine Artful has cost taxpayers more than £1billion . Stuart Godden, Astute Programme Director for BAE Systems, said: 'The launch of Artful is another significant step forward in the Astute programme. 'Building on past experiences we’ve been able to launch her in the most advanced state of construction of any submarine to be built in Barrow. This allows us to now fully concentrate on the test and commissioning activities required to get her to sea. 'Moving a submarine of this size from its build hall to the water is very challenging. It’s testament to the experience and careful planning of the team involved that Artful is now ready for the next phase in her programme. 'Witnessing a submarine move out of the hall and be readied for launch is truly inspiring and a source of great pride to the thousands who have played a part in getting Artful to this stage.' Artful will now undergo a series of . complex tests to prove the safety and operability of her systems before she departs BAE Systems’ site for sea trials. Natural habitat: Artful got her toes wet for the first time yesterday, 24 hours emerging from the Devonshire Dock Hall in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria . Final checks: Artful will now undergo a series of tests to prove the safety and operability of her systems before she departs BAE Systems' site for sea trials . The Ministry of Defence’s Director Submarines, Rear Admiral Mike Wareham, said: 'The Astute programme is making real progress and the sight of the third submarine afloat in the water is a reflection of the hard work of both the MOD and industry. 'The launch of this submarine brings it a step closer to entering into service where it will provide a key capability for the Royal Navy and an essential component of the Submarine Service into the future.' BAE Systems, the prime contractor in the Astute programme, is the UK's only designer and builder of nuclear powered submarines - one of the most complex engineering programmes in the world today. The first two submarines in the Astute class – HMS Astute and HMS Ambush – have now been handed over to the UK Royal Navy, while the remaining five are in various stages of construction.","Artful and her sisters in the Astute class set a new standard in weapons load and stealth .

"A prankster was branded a 'reptile' today after he admitted recording himself doing a vile NekNomination stunt by swallowing - a live frog and lizard. Sheldon Jeans, 23, stripped to the waist and dressed in a 'Scouser' black curly wig and moustache before introducing the stunt to the camera. During the 90-second-long clip, Jeans downed a glass of water filled with crickets, before putting a frog in the same vessel and knocking it back whole. Scroll down for video . Sheldon Jeans swallowed a live frog and a lizard during the Neknomination stunt which he posted on Facebook . Jeans pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to the creatures under the 2006 Animal Welfare Act . Jeans, pictured, apologised to the three-inch long lizard before covering it in water and swallowing it whole . Jeans, of Cowplain, Hampshire even apologises to the three inch long lizard before covering it with water and swallowing it whole. Despite claiming he regurgitated the animals afterwards, Jeans became the first person to be successfully prosecuted for causing cruelty to any creature other than a fish, while taking part in the web craze. He was ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work after admitting causing unnecessary suffering to the animals, under the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Portsmouth Magistrates' Court also ordered him to pay £1,200 in costs after changing his plea to guilty on the first day of his trial. RSPCA inspector Alan Browning said: 'Unfortunately this isn't the first case we've had involving NekNomination, but it is the first to come to court that involved animals other than fish. 'The two small animals would have suffered considerably during this incident, going through the distress of being swallowed and coming into contact with stomach acids. 'We hope this sick game is now on the decline as it is just not acceptable to subject animals to this sort of ordeal.' In the video, he said: 'Hello this is Sheldon Jeans with a NekNomination. 'As you can see on the table in front of me, I've got a glass full of crickets. I had to get little ones because the geezer thought I was buying these for myself. 'I've got myself a lizard and I've got myself a frog. I'm going to call this the ""I'm a Celebrity, Get me Out of Here Nek Challenge."" First up, for the crickets.' Jeans zoomed the video camera onto to the frog so viewers could see that the amphibian was real . He also showed viewers that he had put the lizard, pictured, into the bottom of his glass before drinking . He also drank a glass full of crickets although these were not covered by animal protection legislation . He then called the frog a 'little fellow', before swallowing it whole and declaring it 'f***ing lovely.' He said to the lizard: 'Sorry mate, but you are next. In with the lizard, we'll have some of that. Add a little bit of water. Don't worry son, it's your turn.' Jeans then posted the footage on Facebook, which led to people complaining to the RSPCA. The only reason he was not prosecuted for killing the crickets during the 3 February stunt was because they are not covered under the Act. Jeans was fined £1,200 and ordered to complete 80 hours of unpaid community service following his stunt . Last month, Will Williams, of Caernarfon, north Wales, was criticised after drinking 70cl of the 40 per cent whiskey ahead of what he called a 'weekend on the beer'. Health experts say the reckless stunt - in which Mr Williams consumed at least 28 units of alcohol - could easily have killed him. The video, which has gained nearly 400,000 views on YouTube, shows Mr Williams biting the seal from the bottle of liquor while his friends laugh in the background. He then inserts a straw into the bottle to help the spirits go down quickly and knocks it back in less than 10 seconds. After spitting on the floor, he then tells his friends 'Neknominate that', a reference to the recent internet craze that saw some killed after drinking large amounts of alcohol. Many of the video's viewers went online to criticise Mr Williams for completing the stunt, which they pointed out could easily have been fatal. In an earlier court case, bin man Paul Wooding of Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire was handed an 18-month conditional discharge after he swallowed live fish during a Neknomination stunt from February. Still from a video of Paul Wooding preparing and drinking a cocktail containing alcohol and four live minnows. (RSPCA) In the video, Wooding announces 'this is my Neknominate' before downing a pint glass of wine, gin, vodka, rum and lemonade - together with the fish. The footage came to the RSPCA's attention after it was seen on Wooding's Facebook page. In it, after downing the cocktail, he nominates four other people to join the drinking game. The Neknominate phenomenon is understood to have emerged in Australia, with Wooding's believed to be the fifth such case to come to court in connection with the craze. After being interviewed about the video, Wooding later posted on Facebook: 'Some people's lives must be that sad and boring, to get any excitement they have to report me to the RSPCA for my Neknominate,' Wooding was also ordered to pay £500 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.","Sheldon Jeans filmed himself swallowing the frog and lizard for a dare .

A study found extracts contained in the beverage, reduced concentrations of the hormone by up to 30 per cent. Olympic doping officials have now raised . concerns that athletes could use tea to hide increased levels of testosterone from standard drugs tests. A study found green tea helped reduce the concentration of testosterone . Testosterone is one of the oldest illegal steroids used in sports, and it is commonly used to build muscle. Experts say athletes taking testosterone for doping purposes typically have 200 to 300 percent more in their bodies than normal. During the study, researchers added green . and white tea extracts - or catechins - to the hormone and discovered that they reduced the concentration by almost a third. The recent anomaly could now lead to a change in the tests ahead of this summer's Games. Olivier Rabin, scientific director of the World . Anti-Doping Agency, or WADA said: 'It's interesting that something as . common as tea could have a significant influence on the steroid . profile. 'We may need to adjust our steroid . (test) to allow us to exclude whether a test is modified by food or . training or disease, before we can say that it's doping,' Olympic sprinter, Ben Johnson, was banned from athletics for life after failing a drugs test for the second time in 1993 . The study was conducted in a laboratory so . scientists said it was too early to tell what the effect of green tea . might be in humans, but similar results have . been found in rodent studies. Other foods and beverages, such as alcohol, are also known to muddle test results and WADA has tight controls on other commonly consumed substances like caffeine. 'There's . no reason to think we just happened to pick the only food in the world . that does this,' said Declan Naughton of Kingston University, who . published the findings in the journal, . Steroids. Charles Yesalis, a doping expert at Pennsylvania State University, said officials needed to react quickly. 'Athletes . will not wait for the clinical trials,' he said. 'I'll bet there are . already lots of athletes out there drinking loads of green tea,' he . added. However some experts said the limited effects . of foods like green tea on masking illegal drug use would be too small . to help doping athletes. 'You would probably need to drink the . tea continuously to get any sustained but minor effect,' said Andrew . Kicman, head of research and development at the Drug Control Centre at . King's College London, which is providing the anti-doping laboratory for . the upcoming Olympics. 'It . would be a very foolish athlete who's thinking of doping with . testosterone and thinks he could drink white or green tea to beat a drug . test,' he said.

 The writers of Toy Story are reportedly in talks to pen a movie based on FarmVille, the popular Facebook game. 
  
 Alec Sokolow and Joel Cohen said in an interview with IGN that they're working with Zynga on a movie based on one of the company's most popular games, adding ""Can't really say too much on that front yet, but 'Old MacDonald' didn't have a factory, if you get our drift."" 
  
 We get it: Making a movie is super risky. Unlike launching new apps and websites, movies are a huge upfront investment in the vague hope of a hit. Hence the tendency to just remake something that's already popular. Or the flurry of movies based on popular websites, apps and tech personalties. The Facebook movie. The Steve Jobs movie (possibly). The Angry Birds movie. Why take a chance on something new when you can buy the rights to something with tens of millions of fans already? 
  
 What does a FarmVille movie look like anyway? No doubt it'll be a computer-animated feature (in 3D, of course!) incorporating the graphics and themes of the Facebook game. But FarmVille is a game in which you tend crops. Is that going to be a bit ... boring? And while to tens of millions of people, FarmVille is an addictive pastime, for the friends of those people (ie. us!) it's actually kind of a nuisance. 
  
 Would a FarmVille movie be met with glowing reviews or - more likely - an audible sigh from those of us who grudgingly tolerate the addiction of our FarmVille-playing friends and relatives? And could the critics be anything but, well, critical of this cynical attempt at turning a successful gaming franchise into an equally popular film? 
  
 Ah, but plenty can happen at these early stages — one of a hundred issues may prevent the movie from entering production. Not to mention that FarmVille is no longer the most popular Facebook game, reducing the potential audience for the movie. Or perhaps I'll be proven sorely wrong. After all, a certain movie based on the Facebook story took home 3 Oscars this year. 
  
 PS. For those movie studios thinking of following suit, Zynga was kind enough to list its top-performing games - plus some intriguing stats - in its IPO filing earlier this year: ||||| In an interview about their work on upcoming game Skylanders Spyro's Adventures, Toy Story writers Alec Sokolow and Joel Cohen have revealed that they're currently in talks to pen a film based on Farmville. 
  
  
  
 Speaking with IGN, the pair said the following when asked about projects they're currently working on: 
  
  
  
 ""So, yes, we will continue writing movies. We are also working on several new and very exciting opportunities. We're in conversations with Zynga to do something with one of their brands. Can't really say too much on that front yet, but 'Old MacDonald' didn't have a factory, if you get our drift."" 
  
  
  
  
  
 Previous rumors have led to speculation about Zynga working on a Mafia Wars film , but a Farmville movie has never been revealed.The project has not been formally announced. When contacted, Zynga refused to comment.For our full interview with Sokolow and Cohen, be sure to check IGN tomorrow. |||||","– If you're among the legions of people coping with FarmVille addicts, well, prepare for a new assault on humanity: The writers behind Toy Story tell IGN that they're working with videogame giant Zynga to bring FarmVille to the big screen: ""We're in conversations with Zynga to do something with one of their brands.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A friend of Peaches Geldof's late mother has claimed she desperately tried to confront the young model over her drug abuse, while friends who knew about her heroin addiction 'turned blind eyes'. Gerry Agar, the former publicist of Paula Yates, said she reached out to Peaches six years ago in a bid to stop her suffering the same fate as her mother, who died of an accidental heroin overdose when Peaches was 11. But she said Peaches, a mother-of-two, suffered after those around her 'said nothing' - despite the 25-year-old relapsing. Scrool down for video . A family friend of Peaches Geldof and her late mother Paula Yates has told how she tried to confront the 25-year-old about her drug use as others turned 'blind eyes' to her heroin habit . This picture, which Peaches posted hours before her death, shows Paula Yates, who died of an accidental heroin overdose in 2000, with Peaches as a young girl. Gerry Agar said: 'I'd lost her mother and my best friend to heroin and I didn't want to lose Peaches' She told Grazia magazine: 'I knew she was in trouble with heroin years ago and I tried to confront her about it. 'So many people around her knew about it but said nothing. But I'd lost her mother and my best friend to heroin and I didn't want to lose Peaches.' The author said she had written Peaches a letter in 2008, encouraging her to wean off the drugs, but that she never heard from her again. Gerry Agar, the former publicist of Paula Yates, said she wrote Peaches a letter in 2008 but did not hear from her again . She said she hoped Peaches would change for good after having her two sons - Astala, two, and Phaedra, one - but that she soon relapsed. She told the magazine that Peaches' death had been 'a horrible waste', just as it was with Miss Yates. Ms Agar previously told the Daily Mail how she had blown the whistle on Miss Yates' drug habit in 1996 after she found opium under her bed in a Smarties box. Detectives did not prosecute Miss Yates because of insufficient evidence. She told the paper: ‘When Paula took drugs she became another person, really a diabolical being. ‘I don’t think anyone truly understands what life was like in that family and Peaches got the worst of it. I can’t even begin to describe what that poor girl lived through.' Peaches was found dead at her £1m home in Wrotham, Kent, in April, by her husband Thomas Cohen. Just a few hours before her death, she posted a picture of herself and her mother on the social networking site Instagram, adding the caption: ‘Me and my mum.’ Miss Yates died in 2000, aged 41. At an inquest into Peaches' death, the court heard stashes of heroin, burned spoons and almost 80 syringes were scattered around the family's country home. Ms Agar said she hoped Peaches would change for good after having her . two sons Phaedra and Astala but that she soon relapsed . Peaches, pictured with her husband Thomas Cohen, had managed to wean herself off the drug but had a relapse in February . North West Kent Coroner Roger Hatch said the sometime television presenter, model and journalist had been trying to wean herself off drugs and was clean five months before her death. She had battled the addiction for three years and had been taking the heroin substitute methadone and having counselling. 'So many people around her knew about it but said nothing' Gerry Agar . In November 2013, a drugs test showed her to be clean and Mr Cohen believed she had defeated the habit. But Mr Cohen, a 24-year-old musician, told the inquest she relapsed in February and was hiding heroin in the loft. When he confronted her about it, she . retrieved a stash she had hidden in the loft and flushed it down the toilet to show . she was serious about giving up. But she failed to break the habit. Mr Hatch said Peaches' death was not quite history repeating itself, in regards to Miss Yates' death, because Miss Geldof had tried to . break her addiction and had returned to the drug for reasons no one . would ever know. She had 3mg per litre of diamorphine, the chemical name for heroin, in her blood. Her mother had 0.3mg when she died.","Gerry Agar accused others of turning 'blind eyes' to Peaches' heroin habit .

"By . Lydia Warren . Toronto Mayor Rob Ford today claimed that rehab saved his life as he returned to work following nearly two months in rehab. The beleaguered politician, 45, looked decidedly slimmer at the press conference as he apologized for his previous outbursts and drug use, and said he took full responsibility for his actions. 'Like a lot of people dealing with substance abuse, I was in complete denial,' he said at the press conference at City Hall. 'But soon it became obvious that my alcohol and drug use was having a serious impact on my family and on my health and on my job as mayor. 'After experiencing some of the darkest moments in my life, I decided that enough was enough. I had become my own worst enemy.' Scroll down for video . Apologies: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford apologized for his actions on his first day back on the job following rehab . Do you think Rob Ford will relapse? Ford said he underwent 'intensive therapy' and physical training at Greenstone rehab center in Bala, Ontario, where staff forced him to confront his 'personal demons'. 'I now know that the staff at Greenstone saved my life,' he said. 'Thanks to my treatment I can proudly say today that I have begun the process of taking control of my life.' He continued: 'But folks, this is a long long road to recovery. No matter what I do, I will never be able to change the mistakes that I have made in the past. 'When I look back on some of the things I have said and some of the things I did when I was using, I am ashamed, embarrassed and humiliated. I was wrong and I have no one but no one to blame but myself. I want to sincerely apologize.' Echoing earlier sentiments about wanting to run for re-election in November, Ford vowed to serve Toronto for 'many, many years'.

Although he thanked his family, he did not mention his long-suffering wife Renata by name in the speech. Rob Ford . Ford, who said he will continue to undergo treatment, spoke shakily throughout the appearance and would not take any questions before he left the room. He had . entered the Greenestone facility in Ontario on May 1 to be treated for . alcohol addition after announcing in April that he was seeking . treatment. He made the decision after another video surfaced that apparently showed him smoking crack; Ford . admitted last year after reports of a similar video that he had smoked . crack in a 'drunken stupor,' following months of denials. He held Monday's press conference in his protocol office - a space that holds just 25 people - so only certain publications were invited, Ford’s communications director Amin Massoudi told the Star. Unhealthier days: Ford is pictured in November last year; he looked decidedly slimmer at Monday's press conference and said he had been working with personal trainers while in rehab . The venue meant that reporters from the . national wire service The Canadian Press, Now Magazine and Toronto . Community News are not welcome - and even the president of the city hall . press gallery. The decision allowed for yet another chapter in Ford's rocky relationship with the media. City spokesperson Wynna Brown said the member's lounge, which is available, would have been more appropriate because it allows for more people. 'From a city point of view, this is not reflective of the approach or the collaborative relationships we have and value with members of the media, particularly our colleagues in the city hall press gallery,' she said. Jonathan Goldsbie, a Now Magazine reporter who was left off the invite list, told the Sun he felt 'shock, anger, frustration and momentarily, disbelief' to have been left of the list. Out and about: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford spent his final Saturday before returning to work shopping in Barrie, Ontario, where he posed for photos. He has been in rehab since the start of May . 'The . decision to hold it in the protocol lounge is an entirely arbitrary one . that offers no tangible benefit to the mayor or his staff,' he said. David . Nickle, president of the city hall press gallery and a reporter for the . Toronto Community News, said the mayor has often limited the media's . access, but never to news conferences. 'I feel the mayor should be facing all the Toronto media that are interested in hearing him,' he said. Ford previously announced plans to launch his re-election campaign on July 1 - Canada Day. Speaking to the Toronto Sun, he said: 'I will be back, I guarantee you. I am coming back and you will see a different Rob Ford.' He said he felt 'great' and was benefiting from the self-imposed exile. Treatment: Ford had entered the Greenestone facility in Ontario, pictured, in May and likened the experience to going to football camp as a youngster . 'It . reminds me of football camp. Kind of like the Washington Redskins camp I . went to as a kid,' he said, adding 'I am working out every day and I am . learning about myself, my past and things like that.' But he said he was missing his family; the only time he had seen his wife and children was for a trip to Crabby Joe's on his birthday, and he added that he was anxious to get back to them. On the subject of his addiction, he acknowledged that it was his own fault. He said: 'No one has enabled me. We were talking about the enabling thing the other day in a meeting. You do booze or drugs because you want to do it. I take full responsibility. I have learned my lesson.'","Ford entered rehab for alcohol addiction treatment on May 1 after 'another video emerged showing him smoking crack'

Veteran TV star Cilla Black joined the euthanasia debate last night, admitting she still thinks 75 is ‘a good age to go’. ‘I still think that way,’ the 71-year-old Blind Date presenter told the Daily Mirror. ‘If things are starting to drop off – like the hearing – and I’ve got twinges in the morning, I do think that.’ Her own mother suffered from the progressive bone disease osteoporosis and endured a slow and painful end. ‘She said to me once, “I’m trying to die but I can’t”, oh God it was heart breaking. The brain was great but the body wasn’t,’ she said. ‘Eventually when she did die she was 84, it wasn’t a good experience. I think that’s what has made me feel like this. ‘My biggest fear is going like that when I can’t control my body.’ However, the mother-of-three, who also has two grandsons, said that although she agreed with clinics like Dignitas in Switzerland, where people can end their own lives, she didn’t plan to take matters into her own hands. She added: ‘I agree with Dignitas, but I couldn’t be the one to administer the poison that kills me. I know I couldn’t commit suicide. I’m too much of a coward, I couldn’t do it. I’d rather somebody make that decision for me.’ Best known for presenting Blind Date from 1985 to 2003, Miss Black has not officially retired but rarely makes TV appearances. She had been due to star in a BBC sitcom with chat show host Paul O’Grady but the project was axed amid concerns she would be unable to stand the long filming hours. Miss Black began her career more than 50 years ago as a singer, and had a string of top ten hits in the Sixties and Seventies.

"The home that inspired one of the most famous paintings in American history could soon be in search of a tenant. If you're keen on living the quiet life in Eldon, Iowa (pop. 900) and have around just $250 per month, the house featured in Grant Wood's 1930 masterpiece American Gothic could be the home for you. The pitchfork, however, won't be included. Look familiar? The house that played backdrop to Grant Wood's 1930 masterpiece American Gothic is now without a tenant as of Monday . American favorite: The somehow equally stoic, comical and unsettling painting has become one of the most parodied works of art of all time . Isolated: The house is in Eldon, Iowa, a town of 900 . In fact, the State Historical Society of Iowa has yet to decide if they intend to again rent out the 700-square-foot 1882 home after tenant of four years Beth Howard moved out. 'There should be a statute of limitations for how long one can live in a tourist attraction,' she joked to the Des Moines Register Tuesday. Monday marked Beth Howard's last day in the house.. And who knows, you may gain artistic inspiration from the home, as Wood did and as Howard did thereafter. Wood was an Iowa painter who spotted the house while traveling through the area. He used it as the backdrop to his 1930 painting of a farmer holding a pitchfork next to his daughter. The man was actually Wood's dentist and the 'wife' the artist's sister Nan. And while not entirely non-fiction, the comically unsettling portrait is perhaps America's most parodied ever. So much so that the house that simply stands in its background has become a tourist attraction. At least initially, that didn't bother Howard. She liked the rent, kept artificially low to make up for the nuisance rubberneckers, and wanted a place to start anew after becoming a widow at age 48. She was inspired and then some, becoming known as the 'Pie Lady' for the impressive pastries she churned out in the historic home's kitchen. She also started a popular pie blog. The tourist attraction is also a home: A woman named Beth Howard lived for fours years in the house, but moved out Monday . Just a regular home...almost: Howard had to keep the windows covered nearly all the time to avoid peeping-tom tourists . Pie Lady: Howard cooked thousands of pies in the famous home's kitchen and made a name for herself, and even wrote a bestselling cookbook, while living there . Homey: Howard managed to make a name for herself as a pie maker, cookbook author and public speaker while she lived in the 1882 home . She also wrote a bestselling cookbook while in the home. But she's now gone off to greener pastures, a room with a view of cows in an equally rural part of the state, to write a book she says will be 'a memoir of the misadventures of living in a masterpiece painting with snakes in the basement.' Meanwhile, Jerome Thompson, the society's historic site administrator, said the group is weighing its options on what to do next.

"Eden Hazard is on the verge of is signing a new contract with Chelsea worth a staggering £200,000 a week. Talks with the Chelsea forward’s lawyer are at an advanced stage and the club are hoping to conclude negotiations with the Belgian international within the next few weeks. Hazard’s extended deal, which will be worth around £10million to the forward over the next five seasons, will also be a bitter blow to long-term suitors Paris St Germain. Eden Hazard (left) is close to signing a new five-year deal at Chelsea worth a staggering £200,000 a week . The Chelsea winger has scored 31 goals in 114 appearances since signing for £32million from Lille in 2012 . Jose Mourinho confirmed on Tuesday: 'It's true Chelsea is trying to have an agreement for a new contract (for Hazard). 'It will be a question of time. It will end with a new contract. 'He wants to commit to us and we want to commit to him for the future.' Hazard is now one of Chelsea’s most influential players and he will be rewarded with a deal that reflects his growing status at the club. The Chelsea forward, who was named the club’s player of the year at the end of last season, was given the No 10 shirt vacated by Juan Mata at the start of the new campaign. Hazard only joined the club two years ago from Lille in a deal worth £32m and has settled in to life in London after some initial difficulties. His partnership with new signing Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa continues to flourish and he is now considered to be one of the club’s biggest assets. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho criticised Hazard's (pictured) work ethic towards the end of last season . Chelsea, who are top of the Barclays Premier League after a stunning start to the season, are busy tying up their best young players on new long term deals. They announced last week that Thibaut Courtois, who has replaced Petr Cech as the club’s first choice keeper, has signed a new five year contact. Chelsea want to protect their interests by committing the best young talent to long-term contracts, but they are also being rewarded with huge rises. Hazard’s deal with Chelsea was worth around £100,000 when he arrived from Lille two years ago, but he will double that when he signs his new contract with the club. Chelsea chief Jose Mourinho continues to influence the key decisions at the club and he has built a new team at Chelsea after a year of transition following his return from Real Madrid. After their Champions League group game with Schalke at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday, they will turn their attentions to a reunion with referee Mike Dean at the Etihad on Sunday. Dean hasn’t refereed a Chelsea fixture since his unbeaten home record came to an end following the defeat against Sunderland at Stamford Bridge last season. Paris Saint-Germain were reportedly interesting in Hazard during the summer but he is committed to Chelsea . At the time, Mourinho sarcastically said: ‘Congratulations to Mike Dean because he made a fantastic performance and congratulations to Mike Riley, because what they did during the season was fantastic for the way the championship is going. ‘Congratulations to all of them and I have nothing more to say.’ Mourinho was later fined £10,000 by the Football Association, but insists he has no issue with Dean, or referees’ chief Mike Riley.","Chelsea winger Eden Hazard to sign new five-year deal at Stamford Bridge .

"Alastair Cook insisted he would be leading England at next year’s World Cup — despite falling for just one run as Sri Lanka clinched the one-day series in Pallekele. Cook’s latest failure with the bat was part of a dismal 90-run defeat for England, who now trail 4-2 in this seven-match series. He also dropped a crucial catch, putting down Kumar Sangakkara on 41. The Sri Lanka batsman went on to make a match-winning 112. Alastair Cook says his dropping of Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara on 41 was a 'really costly drop' Cook takes the field for what would be a tough day at the office for the England captain in the sixth ODI . Cook, the England captain, said: ‘Days like these don’t make the job any easier. It’s tough, not scoring the runs I’d like. It’s not a great place to be as a captain. I’m a better player than I’m showing at the moment. I’ve just got to keep going.’ Cook, who averages 17 in this series and has made only one half-century in his last 21 one-day innings, was confirmed as World Cup captain a week ago and seems to be in no mood to relinquish the job. But when coach Peter Moores was asked by Sky Sports to confirm Cook’s captaincy, he said: ‘We review everything at the end of every series. We’ve always said that. ‘We make no bones that we’re passionate to try to get our best side to go out and win a World Cup. Cook needs runs but he’s also had some great times as an England player. He’s in a tough patch but that’s something he’s working hard to get out of.’ Sangakkara leaves the field in Kandy for the final time after spearheading Sri Lanka's 90-run ODI win . The keeper-batsman's team-mates ensure their veteran leads them off the field after clinching the series . Cook acknowledged his drop of man of the match Kumar Sangakkara was damaging as England lost the sixth one-day international against Sri Lanka in Pallekele. Sangakkara, dropped by Cook at mid off on 41, hit a run-a-ball 112 at the Pallekele International Stadium in his last one-day international on his home ground. It set up a 90-run success which consigns England to a series defeat with one match to play. Cook said afterwards on Sky Sports: 'It didn't help, me dropping ""Sanga"" on 40 was a really costly drop . 'That was a really big catch to drop at that time because we'd built up quite a lot of pressure on them. 'It was probably a 260 (run) wicket and credit to him, he made us pay for that.' After putting down Sangakkara, who got 112, Cook was out LBW to Sachithra Senanayake for just one . England coach Moores said: 'We felt we could draw the series level today but we've been outplayed in all departments. 'We probably bowled our best up front. Towards the end our plans have to be a bit clearer, a bit simpler. Not just bowling yorkers but matching the ball you bowl to the field you've got, although the yorker is still a great ball if you bowl it well. 'We made some errors and didn't field as well as we could have.' Sri Lanka captain Angelo Matthews said: 'It was a challenging wicket to bat on but 'Sanga' was amazing once again. 'Together with (Tillakaratne) Dilshan, they were brilliant and set the tone for us to launch at the end. 'The older he (Sangakkara) gets, the more runs he scores.' Sangakkara himself added: 'It's great to have grown up in Kandy and gone to school here ... to play one of my last games here is a special feeling. 'I've had a wonderful career and it's extra special to finish off with a win.'","England captain Alastair Cook dropped Kumar Sangakkara on 41 .

"By . Michael Zennie and Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:56 EST, 25 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:52 EST, 25 August 2013 . George Zimmerman's lawyer has chided him for visiting a firearms factory that makes the type of gun he used to kill unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin last year. Zimmerman, who was acquitted of murder in July, was this week pictured at the Kel-Tec plant in Cocoa, Florida, grinning and shaking hands with an employee. 'We understand how George visiting the factory that produces the gun used to shoot Trayvon Martin is seen as inappropriate,' Shawn Vincent, spokesman for Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara, told Reuters on Friday. Scroll down for video . Shopping around: This is the first public image of George Zimmerman to emerge since his acquittal on murder charges. He poses here with an employee at the Kel Tec gun factory . Zimmerman and his lawyer stopped at the gun maker's headquarters to check out the high-capacity Kel-Tec KSG pump-action shotgun. TMZ.com reports that Zimmerman was interested in buying the weapon, though it is unclear whether he actually left with one. Kel-Tec is the same company that made the . PF-9 9mm pistol he used to shoot 17-year-old Trayvon last year. Zimmerman contended he killed the teen in self-defense after he . sustained a beating. TMZ . reports that the son of Kel-Tec's owner personally gave Zimmerman a tour . of the company in Coca, Florida, including a view of the manufacturing . plant and showroom. Making a statement: The Kel-Tec KSG holds up to 15 shotshells - nearly twice the capacity of traditional tractical-style shotguns . In the market for a new gun: George Zimmerman was seen shopping for a high-tech shotgun at the headquarters of Kel-Tec arms . Zimmerman and his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, were looking into the legality of buying a Kel-Tec KSG, a cutting edge weapon that has two magazines to hold shotgun shells, according to reports. He posed for at least one photograph with a worker at the plant. It is unknown whether he actually bought the weapon. The KSG can fire up to 15 12-gauge shotgun shells without re-loading, nearly twice the capacity of other tactical-style shotguns, which are usually converted hunting arms.The gun costs about $1,200. Shotguns like the KSG are primarily used for home defense. Shotshells fire multiple pellets at once that are meant to spread out. Zimmerman's 9mm pistol, also made by Kel Tec, was returned to him after he was acquitted of all charges in the death of Trayvon Martin . They can be devastating at close range - and much more effective than the 9mm bullet fired by his handgun. Shotshells lose most of their effectiveness at ranges over 25 to 35 yards. Whereas Zimmerman's Kel-Tec pistol is small and concealable, the shotgun he examined is meant to make a statement. It emits an audible sound - familiar to any hunter or fan of zombie movies - whenever the action is cycled. Zimmerman, 29, has been a free man since he was acquitted of all charges July 13 in the shooting of unarmed Trayvon. The racially-charged case brought thousands of death threats to Zimmerman and his family. A fringe black panther group reportedly put a price on his head, as well. After his acquittal, police returned the pistol that killed Trayvon to Zimmerman. He was carrying it in his truck when he was pulled over in Texas less than two weeks later. The former neighborhood watch volunteer from Sanford, Florida, was forced to flee his home and has been in hiding ever since the case began receiving international attention.

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid returned to the top of the table in Spain after edging past Racing Santander 1-0 on Saturday, while previous leaders Barcelona could only draw 1-1 at Athletic Bilbao. Real, still missing the injured Cristiano Ronaldo and with veteran talisman Raul starting on the bench, dominated struggling Santander but had only a solitary first-half strike from Gonzalo Higuain to show for it. The visitors should have snatched a point, but Sergio Canales saw his 77th minute effort wrongly ruled out for an offside by a teammate who was not in the line of play. Real, whose last home outing ended in an embarrassing exit from the Copa Del Rey against lower-league opposition, saw midfielder Xabi Alonso hit the post in the 13th minute and then defender Alvaro Arbeloa also hit the woodwork with a floated cross. Argentina forward Higuain, who started in place of Raul, kept up his good goalscoring form in the 22nd minute when he pounced from close range after Kaka's right-wing cross was not cleared. Karim Benzema thought he had doubled the lead in the 55th minute, but the France forward's effort was correctly ruled out for a marginal offside before he made way for Raul. The result lifted some of the pressure piling up on Real coach Manuel Pellegrini, who has a big week ahead with Wednesday's Champions league clash against FC Zurich and then the ""El Clasico"" battle with Barcelona on Sunday. Real will go into that match at the Nou Camp with a one-point lead over Barca, who were missing the swine flu-stricken Rafael Marquez, Yaya Toure and Eric Abidal and the injured Zlatan Ibrahimovic for the trip to Bilbao. Lionel Messi inspired the Spanish and European champions' best moments in the first half, with Thierry Henry left on the bench following his controversial handball incident in France's World Cup playoff win against the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday. But it was the Basque side who should have taken the lead on the stroke of halftime when Javier Martinez headed a golden chance wide when it seemed easier to score. Barcelona took the lead in the 54th minute when Xavi threaded a superb pass to Dani Alves and the Brazilian fullback coolly slotted in the opening goal. However, that lead lasted only nine minutes as substitute Gaizka Toquero ghosted in behind Alves to collect his teammate's headed flick-on and calmly sidefoot high into the net. Henry was finally brought on by coach Pep Guardiola in the 84th minute, but Barcelona could not penetrate the stubborn Bilbao defense, with the home side left in seventh place after a hard-earned point. Barcelona next take on Italian champions Inter Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday, needing a result to keep alive their hopes of reaching the knockout stages. Sevilla consolidated third place after holding on to win 2-1 at Tenerife. Diego Perotti put the visitors ahead in the 32nd minute with a close-range finish from a cross by new Spain cap Jesus Navas, who almost gave away a penalty three minutes into the second half when Marc Valiente went down. Sevilla immediately counter-attacked and midfielder Renato crashed in a shot from the edge of the area after being set up by fellow Brazilian Luis Fabiano. Striker Nino gave Tenerife hope with a superb volley 15 minutes from the end, but Sevilla defended well to earn the three points. Atletico Madrid crashed to a third straight defeat under new coach Quique Sanchez Flores, losing 2-1 at Deportivo La Coruna after Andres Guardado's dramatic last-minute penalty. Argentina striker Sergio Aguero put Atletico ahead after just three minutes, but Diego Colotto leveled the score on 20 and Guardado kept his cool at the death after Pablo brought down Alberto Lopo. Sanchez Flores raced onto the pitch as Atletico protested furiously, resulting in Cleber Santana being sent off.","Real Madrid return to top of table in Spain after beating Racing Santander 1-0 .

"(CNN) -- The age of the virtual assistant is here to stay with Microsoft adding the voice of Cortana to its Windows Phone 8.1. I'm old enough to remember the days when certain computing tasks required a steep learning curve. Now it seems almost magical that I can tell my virtual assistant to remind me to take out the garbage when I get home or call my mom when I get busy. The best part is that when it speaks to me, it does so in a way that allows me to believe, for a brief moment, that I'm interacting with another person. That's because these virtual assistants sound so human. For the creators of artificial intelligent systems, it's critical to build them so that they can facilitate emotional connection with users. When machine interactions with humans feel effortless, natural and ""real,"" that's the ultimate metric of success. We're just getting started. Today's artificial intelligence systems are just scratching the surface of what's possible for personal assistants, advisors and maybe, in some cases, true companions. Indeed, the machine-human relationship in the movie ""Her"" may not seem so far-fetched in the decades to come. Future virtual assistants will offer far more capabilities and can be personalized for each person. Why should we settle for the voice that companies choose for us? We've known for quite some time that typically female voices are preferred, based on their ability to be heard in a clear manner across a broad range of devices. Of course, female voices also tend to be trusted more than male voices. However, if there is one request heard over and over again, it's for more and varied choices in the persona of these virtual assistants, along with greater control over their spoken voice. Creating text-to-speech, or TTS, can be a difficult task. The more human the system needs to sound the more data needs to be collected. Often times this requires massive amounts of linguistic and acoustic information, based on recordings of real humans. Fortunately, the technology is rapidly evolving. Future modeling techniques, where TTS voices are made from mathematical models of its human counterparts, will be lifelike enough to simulate human speech. They will also allow more rapid voice creation, allowing a previously unachievable level of personalization, where each person could even pick his or her unique voice for a virtual assistant. Modeling technology will also make possible the combination of different voice traits. For example, the deep qualities of a voice similar to James Earl Jones could be combined with the unorthodox speaking style of someone like Jack Nicholson. Microsoft took a page from the gaming world by basing Cortana on the character from the Halo video game series. Perhaps future voices in our devices will be as readily available to manipulate to create a cacophony of recognizable personal assistants from favorite film and TV actors, radio hosts, family members, comedians -- the sky would be the limit. Whether it's a character from our favorite game or movie, or a persona created by users themselves, we could allow our virtual assistants the freedom to keep us entertained as well as informed. While there is a fine line between personalization and novelty, I see us on a collision course for having more intelligent conversations with our digital assistants in the years ahead. The gadget-oriented systems of today will continue to grow and adapt to our ever-expanding needs, and the more they learn about us, the more they can assist us. When looking at the challenges facing humanity, whether it's eradicating disease, solving our planet's renewable energy needs, or even colonizing other worlds, it's worth pondering if it will be the humans or the intelligence systems that we create that will tackle these problems. And will we be listening if it's the virtual assistants that are doing the work?","Microsoft added the voice of Cortana to its Windows Phone 8.1 .

"A Toronto man was bitten on the head by a 400lb black bear - and survived. Joe Azougar, 30, was having breakfast on the porch of his cabin at about 10am on Saturday when a bear suddenly charged at him. 'I could hear this thud, this vibration on the ground. Then there was this bear coming towards me,' Mr Azougar, who had recently moved to the remote cabin from Toronto, said. Joe Azougar gave a thumbs up with girlfriend Brooke Bowerman after surviving a bear attack in Canada . Azougar needed more than 300 stitches to his scalp and shoulder after being attacked. His dog was killed . As the internet entrepreneur ran for cover, his faithful German Shepherd dog ran at the bear. After the bear killed his dog, it charged at the cabin about 10 miles outside of Cochrane, Canada, which Mr Azougar moved about a month ago. 'He started rushing the window, breaking the window and chipping off wood beside the window,' Mr Azougar said. Mr Azougar fled the cabin, but the bear followed. 'He knocked me down and I covered my head. He took my shoulder apart, then he peeled the skin off my head and started biting my skull,' Mr Azougar said. ""I could feel his teeth rubbing against my skull ... I was just screaming. I could feel my flesh being pulled by his teeth,' he told The Sudbury Star. Thankfully, two women driving near his cabin heard Mr Azougar's screams. Relief: Joe Azougar is comforted by his girlfriend Brooke Bowerman as he recovers from the savage attack . They used the car horn to scare the bear away, before driving Mr Azougar to the Lady Minto Hospital in Cochrane. The businessman, who moved to the remote Ontario region to start his own internet company, needed more than 300 stitches and will be kept in hospital for several days. When the women, who have not been identified, first arrived at the cabin they could only see the bear. The woman have not been identified but Mr Azougar is keen to thank them. 'They are my angels. Without them, I wouldn't be alive,' he said. 'If it wasn’t for them, my family would be attending my funeral,' he told CTV News. Mr Azougar is being comforted at the hospital by his girlfriend, Brooke Bowerman,and mother, Itto Bentayed, who drove from Toronto to be at his bedside. Ontario Provincial Police and the Ministry of Natural Resources killed the bear after the attack was reported. In a study of bear attacks between 1900 and 2009 it was found that most happened in Canada. 'From a public safety standpoint, black bears are an unpredictable, wild animal,"" John Kaplanis, of the Northwestern Ontario Sportsmen's Alliance, told The Globe and Mail. Bear aware: Ontario has more than 75,000 black bears like the 400lb one that attacked Mr Azougar . 'They're not the cuddly little teddy bears we see on television.' Ontario has more than 75,000 black bears, but its Ministry of Natural Resources has resisted calls for the spring bear hunting season to be reinstated. Hikers and residents are offered advice on how to be 'bear aware' to prevent attacks and what to do if they come face-to-face with a bear.","Toronto man needs more than 300 stitches after savage attack .

"London (CNN) Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have revealed further details about their wedding -- including how the bride's parents will be involved, the timing of their honeymoon and how they plan to remember Harry's mother, Princess Diana. 
  
 Meghan's mother and father, Doria Ragland and Thomas Markle, who split up when she was young, will both attend. In the days before the wedding, they will fly into the UK to spend time with the British royal family, including Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh, according to Jason Knauf, communications secretary to Prince Harry. 
  
 Meghan will spend her last night as a single woman at a hotel in an undisclosed location. 
  
 Then, on the morning of Saturday, May 19, a car will take Meghan and her mother to Windsor Castle before her father walks her down the aisle of St. George's Chapel at 12.00 p.m. (7.00 a.m. ET). 
  
 Knauf said Meghan is ""delighted to have her parents by her side on this important and happy occasion."" 
  
 Read More ||||| LONDON -- Meghan Markle's divorced parents will meet with Queen Elizabeth II and other royals before her May 19 wedding to Prince Harry and will have special roles in their daughter's wedding, a palace spokesman said Friday. At the wedding, the royal couple also plan to honor the memory of the late Princess Diana, Harry's mother, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997. 
  
 Officials didn't predict the weather - springtime in England can be glorious or horrid, sometimes on the same day - but they outlined plans for a celebration designed to spread from the privileged environs of Windsor Castle throughout Britain and the world, via television and the internet. 
  
 Here are some of the plans disclosed by Harry's press secretary, Jason Knauf, during a briefing at Buckingham Palace: 
  
 Meghan's Parents To Take Part In Wedding 
  
 Markle's parents, Thomas Markle and Doria Ragland, will arrive during the week before the May 19 wedding so they have time to meet Harry's family. 
  
 Knauf says they will visit with the queen, her husband Prince Philip, Harry's father Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, and with Harry's brother Prince William and his sister-in-law Kate. 
  
 Ragland will travel with her daughter by car to Windsor Castle on May 19 and Thomas Markle will walk his daughter down the aisle of St. George's Chapel for the ceremony. 
  
 Knauf says Markle is ""delighted"" that her parents will be by her side. He did not say whether Markle's half brother and half sister will attend the wedding.

 Princess Diana's Family Will Have A Role 
  
 The press secretary says Harry is ""keen to involve his mother's family in the wedding"" and that all three of Diana's siblings will be present. One of Diana's two older sisters, Jane Fellowes, will give a reading during the ceremony to represent Diana's family. 
  
 ___ 
  
 No Maid Of Honor 
  
 Markle, an American actress who came to prominence in the TV series ""Suits,"" will not have a maid of honor during the ceremony. 
  
 Harry has chosen William as his best man. 
  
 ___ 
  
 Young Bidesmaids And Page Boys 
  
 Knauf says all the bridesmaids and page boys will be children. That may mean a role for Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 3, the children of Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge. But don't bother looking for Prince Louis - born in late April - as the youngest prince will not attend the wedding. 
  
 ___ 
  
 Don't Ask About The Dress 
  
 Palace officials are determined that the style and designer of Markle's wedding gown will be kept secret until the moment she gets out of the car to walk into the chapel. They say this tradition is very important - but that won't keep speculators from trying to guess who has received the most important dressmaking assignment of the year. 
  
 ___ 
  
 Separated The Night Before 
  
 The press secretary says Harry and Markle will spend the night before the wedding apart. They have been living together in recent months since announcing their engagement. They will spend their first night as a married couple in Windsor Castle. 
  
 ___ 
  
 Good Wishes For Prince Philip's Health 
  
 Palace officials say they're hopeful that 96-year-old Prince Philip, Harry's grandfather, will be well enough to attend the wedding festivities . The queen's husband has been recovering from hip replacement surgery and has not participated in any public events since being discharged from the hospital in mid-April. 
  
 ___ 
  
 Follow The Wedding At Home 
  
 The palace plans to publish the Order of Service on its website the morning of the wedding so people watching it on television will be better able to follow what's taking place inside the church. 
  
 ___ 
  
 Delayed Honeymoon 
  
 Knauf would not reveal where the newest royal couple will spend their honeymoon, but he said they won't be leaving right after the wedding. Instead they plan to make their first public appearance as a married couple during the week following the ceremony. In the past, they have traveled in Africa together.

"In the wake of the Baby Gammy scandal and a string of similar cases, the Thai government has passed a law criminalising surrogacy and prohibiting foreigners from seeking surrogacy services. The law, which prohibits the act of hiring women commercially to carry foetuses to term, aims to stop Thailand from being a surrogacy hub for foreign couples. It comes after a several scandals involving Australian citizens this year, including the infamous Baby Gammy saga and the tandem threat it sparked for a Victorian couple, who almost lost triplet girls they arranged through a surrogate. Scroll down for video . The world watched on in horror as baby Gammy was left abandoned by his Australian parents . It was reported that Wendy (left) and David (right) Farnell returned to Australia from Thailand with his healthy twin sister Pipah (centre) but left Gammy behind . Thai surrogate Pattaramon Chanbua, who alleged the Farnell couple from West Australia abandoned Gammy when they found out he had Down syndrome . National Legislative Assembly member Wanlop Tangkananurak said the new laws are intended to evade such recent incidents. 'Surrogacy business leaves too much long-term trouble for Thailand, so we are banning foreign couples from seeking surrogacy in our country to avoid being a hub and to prevent what we saw last year,' Wanlop said. The parliament voted 160 to 2 to pass the law Thursday night. Under the new law, a Thai couple is allowed to seek a surrogate to carry the fetus only if they are able to prove that they and their relatives are infertile. It also says that anyone involved in commercial surrogacy will face a maximum jail term of 10 years and a maximum fine of 200,000 baht ($6,100). Shannon Sanderson, 38, and Peter Trigg, 44, nearly lost the beautiful triplet girls they arranged through aThai surrogate mother, when a Perth couple abandoned their disabled son Gammy in Thailand . The Thai Government has criminalising surrogacy in a bid to evade any further surrogacy scandals . Thailand was one of the few countries in Asia where commercial surrogacy was not specifically banned by law. There was however a regulation stating that doctors risk losing their license if they perform surrogacy for pay. Thailand became a go-to destination for couples from Australia, Hong Kong and Taiwan and a low-cost alternative to the United States. National Assembly of Thailand, where the parliament voted 160 to 2 to pass the surrogacy law on Thursday night . Thailand was one of the few countries in Asia where commercial surrogacy was not specifically banned by law . But this led to a string of scandals. In July 2014, a West Australian couple were accused abandoning an infant known as Baby Gammy, leaving him with with his surrogate mother learning he had Down Syndrome. Thai surrogate Pattaramon Chanbua alleged Wendy and David Farnell-the latter being a convicted child sex offender-left Gammy and returned to Western Australia with his healthy twin sister, Pipah. Two Victorian men, Shannon Sanderson, 38, and Peter Trigg, 44, were terrified the scandal would mean they may never get to see the faces of their unborn triplets. As the news broke around the world, Thai surrogate agencies went into lockdown, disconnecting their phones and shutting off email connections. The Gammy saga cast a controversial light on the largely unregulated business of commercial surrogacy . But Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop stepped in, negotiating with the Thai military to allow the couple caeess to the country and their children. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs estimated that 50 Thai surrogate mothers are expected to carry babies for Australian couples by the end of 2015. There is currently a changeover period being debated to enable the children and their Australian parents to depart Thailand.","The law prohibited foreigners from seeking surrogacy services .

"Picture this: you've taken the week off work and booked a holiday on a remote tropical beach. You land, drop of your things and walk down to the shore...Only to find a formidable mountain of thongs, plastic bottles and false teeth. Late last month, three tonnes of junk washed up on Old Mapoon beach, a remote and tropical area in far northern Queensland . A team of Indigenous rangers and workers from the Tangaroa Blue Foundation spent five days clearing the seven-kilometre shoreline . A turtle hatchling scrambles for the surf on Mapoon beach. It is believed that a third of turtle deaths in Australia happen from plastic ingestion . Late last month, three tonnes of junk washed up on Old Mapoon beach in northern Queensland. A team of Indigenous rangers and workers from the charity Tangaroa Blue Foundation spent five gruelling days cleaning the seven-kilometre shoreline. Amongst the expanse of waste they found fishing nets, false teeth, bags full of plastic bottles (some filled with urine) and an enormous army of toy soldiers. Heidi Taylor, the co-founder of Tangoroa, said her company got word of the waste from a local team of rangers. ‘We work closely with the local waste rangers. They said they had seen a lot of waste washing up in the direction of Mapoon beach, which is a hotspot for Marine debris. ‘It’s a very desolate area without many communities, so the rangers were naturally overwhelmed by the project and they called on us to come and help out.’ Mapoon is on the Gulf of Carpentaria, which gets a large amount of stray waste from the Arufuru Sea in Asia. The current then moves on towards the Northern Territory, harming all marine life in it's path. Taylor said the labels on much of the waste showed it had come from foreign shores. ‘The labels suggest the waste was predominantly from south-east Asia, which is consistent with our prior experience.’ Taylor said that since much of the waste was plastic, it can stick around in the ocean until a big tide comes and washes it ashore. 'The fact that most of the waste is coming from international waters certainly makes it more difficult to tackle as an issue. Heidi Taylor, the co-founder of Tangoroa, said her company works closely with the local waste rangers (pictured above) who advise her when there is significant waste buildup .

A ranger's four wheel drive transports ecotourist volunteers along Mapoon beach looking for turtle nests . 'It's a serious problem. It's impacting the marine life across the whole of the Cape York.' It is believed that a third of turtle deaths in Australia happen from plastic ingestion. Amongst the masses of junk on the beach, the remains of local turtles were found. 'We need to work at this from a federal level using government agencies. It's the only way we can really have an impact on the waste disposal from our neighbouring countries. 'Some of this waste is coming from third world countries where there is barely no recycling institutions. The only way to impact this is through government co-operation.' Taylor says the issue is only going to get worse. 'The bottom-line is that our population is increasing. And more people means more waste. 'Tackling pollution needs to be a two pronged approach. We need to continue to build teams to clean up the areas that are badly effected, but we also need to look at the data and put pressure on the companies that are producing the most waste and ask them to take more responsibility.'

"(CNN)  -- Police said they are pursuing leads in the death of 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, whose body was found Monday stuffed into a suitcase in a dairy-farm pond near her Tracy, California, home. Sandra Cantu, 8, disappeared March 27. Her body was found at a dairy-farm pond near her Calilfornia home. ""We are heading in a direction,"" Tracy police Sgt. Tony Sheneman told reporters. ""To comment on that would compromise the investigation, and I can't do that."" A search warrant was executed at the Tracy mobile home park where the girl lived, and a related search was to be conducted Tuesday at a nearby church, he said. He implied more than one person may have been involved in the death of Sandra, who had been missing since March 27. ""Investigators are looking at additional information they received since yesterday and, hopefully, that will lead us to Sandra's killers,"" he said. Asked if his use of the plural meant police were looking for more than one person, he responded, ""We have no specific suspects, ma'am."" Sheneman also implied the killer likely was familiar with the location where the body was found. He said he himself was unfamiliar with the location where the girl's body was found, despite having lived in the community for nearly 12 years. ""Someone would have to be familiar with that area to know to go there,"" he said.  Watch how the suitcase was found » . Sheneman said police had no one in custody, despite having interviewed hundreds of people regarding the case. ""Everyone that we speak to right now is being considered a person of interest,"" he said. ""We're not eliminating anyone."" The autopsy was being conducted Tuesday, but it was not clear when the report would be available. ""It's going to be some time before we hear from the coroner,"" Sheneman said. ""I can't tell you when that's going to be."" More than 10 search warrants have been executed as part of the investigation and ""a lot"" of evidence has been recovered, Sheneman said. The day Sandra was last reported seen, she returned home from school, kissed her mother and left to play with a friend who lives nearby. A short time later, wearing a pink Hello Kitty T-shirt and black leggings, she left to go to another friend's home, according to a family spokeswoman. Police said Monday the girl's clothing helped them identify the body.","NEW: Police imply person or persons involved in Sandra Cantu's death from area .

"The Prime Minister has drawn a line in the sand with students and youth unemployed today, telling them to 'pull your weight' as he made it clear there will be no softening of the government's Work for the Dole program. 'I want to see every Australian pulling his or her weight. That's very important,' Mr Abbott said. There was an outcry from students and welfare groups after the May Budget, when Treasurer Joe Hockey announced the overhaul of Work for the Dole and unemployment benefits. 'Pull your weight'. Tony Abbott has today signalled no softening of the Work for the Dole scheme . An angry St Vincent de Paul Society CEO Dr John Falzon said: 'You don't help young help people into work by forcing them to live below the poverty line and you certainly don't help them into a job by forcing them to rely on charity to survive' But the Prime Minister fired another salvo today. 'The last thing we want is to see young people leaving school and going on to unemployment benefits,' the Prime Minister said. St Vincent de Paul Society CEO, Dr John Falzon, hit back: 'What we had hoped for was a jobs plan, what we have got instead is a bashing the young unemployed plan.' The PM said that school leavers did not have to rely on the dole 'particularly when there is going to be a stronger training system and more effective system in the future, than there has been in the past.' He said the government has missed the point and the labour market structure is the problem, not those seeking work. 'You don't help young help people into work by forcing them to live below the poverty line and you certainly don't help them into a job by forcing them to rely on charity to survive,' Dr Falzon added. The PM said that school leavers did not have to rely on the dole 'particularly when there is going to be a stronger training system and more effective system in the future, than there has been in the past.' From the start of 2015, new job-seekers under the age of 30 will have to wait up to six months before receiving unemployment benefits. Further, they will then have to participate in at least 25 hours per week under Work for the Dole, to receive any payments for the next six months. 'The problem is structural but the government insists on using the language of demonising and blame to the very people who are suffering the affects of that structure,' Dr Falzon added. A national day of action is planned by tertiary students to protest against the Work for the Dole changes and education overhaul.

Two years after he disappeared from his Long Island home, Disaster the cat was found this week in the heart of Manhattan - by a Times Square haunted house promoter dressed up as a zombie. Jeremy Zelkowitz, who sells tickets for the Times Scare haunted house, spotted Disaster early Saturday morning crossing 42nd Street. Rescued: Jeremy Zelkowitz, who dresses as a zombie for a year-round haunted house exhibit in Times Square, holds a cat named Disaster which he found crossing 42nd Street in Manhattan last month . Rescued: Zelkowitz, 22, scooped up the black and white cat that appeared well-kept and neat near the haunted house, pictured, before taking it to a nearby animal hospital . He snatched up Disaster, a black and . white cat who appeared to be well-kept and neat, and brought him to a . nearby animal hospital. 'I'm a big animal lover but I have a dog so I couldn't take him,' Zelkowitz, 22, said on Thursday. 'The whole situation is very, very bizarre.' Staff at the BluePearl Veterinary Partners animal hospital scanned Disaster who had been implanted with a microchip, revealing his last known owner: New York City police Officer Jimmy Helliesen. Helliesen, 51, received a call Saturday morning from the hospital, informing him that his long-lost feline friend had been found. 'I was shocked,' said Helliesen. 'How did he get to Manhattan?

Eager to help: Zelkowitz, seen in character on the streets of New York, says he would have adopted the cat himself but has a dog at home . For years Helliesen has adopted stray cats he finds hanging around his Brooklyn precinct. Two years ago he adopted Disaster after he strayed from the precinct and ended up getting captured by local Animal Care and Control. That's when Helliesen got him fixed and implanted with the chip. But six months after living in his Long Island home, Disaster escaped one day through an open window and never returned.

"A first-ever success at the ABAX Stadium moved Uwe Rosler's men to within four points of second-placed Bolton, who have a game in hand and face Oldham Athletic on Saturday.
Fleetwood took command in a first half they dominated, former Peterborough man David Ball laying on a simple 24th-minute opener for Bobby Grant before Ashley Eastham was left with a similarly easy finish three minutes from half-time after fine work from George Glendon following a quickly-taken corner.
It took hosts Posh an hour to pose any sort of attacking threat on a day where their last mathematical hope of making the play-offs disappeared.
Craig Mackail-Smith saw a penalty shout ignored after being clattered by Alex Cairns, but he fired past the Fleetwood keeper to halve his side's arrears in the 68th minute.
Mackail-Smith tapped home following a brilliant burst and low delivery from the left by Marcus Maddison.

"The civil case brought by Judy Huth accuses Mr Cosby of sexually assaulting her as a 15-year-old at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles in the 1970s.
The 78-year-old is facing a series of sexual assault accusations dating back decades.
He has always maintained his innocence and has never been criminally charged.
Ms Huth alleges that Mr Cosby plied her with alcohol before sexually assaulting her.
The decision by the court means that Ms Huth's lawyers will be able to question Mr Cosby under oath.
Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, described it as a ""major victory"" and says she intends to take a sworn deposition from the comedian within the next month.
Earlier in the week, the LA police department confirmed that it was investigating ""certain complaints against him"".
The rise and fall of Quaaludes
Bill Cosby: America's dad under fire
It has already emerged from a previous lawsuit that Mr Cosby admitted giving a woman drugs before sex.
Court documents relating to the case brought in 2005 Andrea Constand - an employee at Temple University in the 1970s - were published earlier this month, after the Associated Press news agency applied to a judge to have the sealed papers made public.
They revealed Mr Cosby had admitted obtaining Quaaludes from several doctors to give to women before sexual encounters, but did not take them himself.
Mr Cosby is now suing Ms Constand for breaching a confidentially agreement after the New York Times obtained a full copy of the deposition.
Dozens of women have accused the comedian of sexually assaulting them but most of the claims are barred by statutes of limitations. They restrict the length of time in which legal actions can be taken after an alleged crime has been committed.
The accusations, which Mr Cosby has described as ""fantastical"" and ""uncorroborated"", have led to some of his stand-up shows being called off and the cancellation of some TV projects.
2002:  Lachele Covington, a 20-year-old actress, reportedly files a police report saying she had been inappropriately touched. No further action was taken.
2005:  Andrea Constand sues Mr Cosby for sexual assault. The case is eventually settled out of court in 2006.
2014: Over the year, dozens of women make public accusations that Mr Cosby sexually assaulted them. Live shows are cancelled across the country amid protests
November 2014: TV network NBC scraps plans for a new show with the comedian following allegations by TV presenter Janice Dickinson that he had assaulted her in 1982. Repeats of the Cosby Show are also pulled from cable TV
December 2014: Judy Huth sues Mr Cosby for molesting her in 1974 when she was 15 years old. Mr Cosby counter-sues, claiming she is trying to extort money from him
May 2015: Mr Cosby speaks publicly about the allegations for the first time. ""I can't speak; I just don't want to argue; I don't talk about it,"" he told ABC News.",A sexual abuse case against the comedian Bill Cosby will continue after the California Supreme Court rejected his petition to review the case.

'This appears to be an individual who was just very curious with explosive devices and then manufactured them,' police spokesman Sgt. Frank Preciado said. The bomb squad went to an apartment complex in the Palms neighborhood of west Los Angeles after officers stopped Wilson for improper vehicle registration on Tuesday night and spotted a clear liquid that was concerning, Lopez said. Officers also found a gun and narcotics. That discovery prompted the search of the man's apartment. The complex and three surrounding buildings were evacuated and several blocks were sealed off.

This means their deaths were not caused by the Taliban, insurgency forces or Afghan forces. The latest army statistics on troop suicides were released last Friday and show 15 active duty soldiers are suspected of killing themselves last month alone. The same number of potential suicides was recorded in August. 'Every suicide in our ranks is a tragic loss for the Army family, adversely affecting the readiness of our Army,' Lt. Gen. Howard B. Bromberg, deputy chief of staff for manpower and personnel, said in a Department of Defense release. 'I am asking soldiers, family members, Department of the Army civilians, neighbors, and friends to look out for each other and reach out and embrace those who may be struggling,' he said.

"New DNA technology could help reveal the killer in an unsolved murder of a mother and her three-year-old daughter. The technique, known as Snapshot, can generate a digital mugshot of the suspect by using samples such as blood and strands of hair left at the scene. Investigators in South Carolina have used the analysis, generated by Parabon Nanolabs, in a bid to get a breakthrough in the slaying of Candra Alston, 25, and her toddler Malaysia Boykin four years ago. Their bodies were found in the busy Brook Pines Apartments in Columbia on January 9, 2011. Unsolved: Investigators in South Carolina are hoping the DNA technique called Snapshot, generated by Parabon Nanolabs, leads to a breakthrough in the slaying of  Malaysia Boykin, three, and Candra Alston four years ago. There were no witnesses to their deaths in January 2011 . Leads: There were no signs of forced entry at their home and police believe the toddler and her mother may have known the killer. More than 200 people have been interviewed in connection to their deaths . Police have never revealed how they died and would only confirm it was by different means. There were no signs of forced entry - leading detectives to believe they knew the killer or killers. The only piece of evidence left at the scene was an unspecified DNA sample that has, until now, been untraceable. As there were no witnesses, authorities turned to the forensic phenotyping and found the suspect was dark-skinned with brown hair and brown eyes. However the computer-generated image does not have an estimated height or age - traits which the company claim are 'very complex'. Speaking to Fox News, Parabon's director of bioinformatics, Ellen McRae Greytak, said: 'This is particularly useful when there are no witnesses, no hits in the DNA database and nothing to go on. Prediction: Using the phenotyping technique, investigators have been able to determine that the suspect is dark-skinned with brown eyes and brown hair . 'Traditional forensic analysis treats DNA as a fingerprint, whereas Snapshot treats it as a blueprint -- a genetic description of a person from which physical appearance can be inferred. 'Traits are generally predicted with more than 80 percent confidence, and importantly, Snapshot also reports which phenotypes can be excluded with more than 95 per cent confidence.' Mark Vinson, a cold case investigator with the Columbia police department, said that more than 200 people were interviewed in connection with the mother and daughter's death. Around 150 of them submitted their DNA - but none matched the sample left at the scene.","Technique known as Snapshot can create a digital mugshot using samples .

But Thai police deny those accusations and say they have . solid evidence, including DNA evidence, against the two men who . were arrested in October. A committee set up by Myanmar's embassy in Thailand to . investigate the case said they had interviewed about 40 Myanmar . nationals who were working on Koh Tao at the time of the . murders. Some of those interviewed were 'strong witnesses' who might . provide evidence to exonerate the accused, said Kyaw Thaung, who . heads the committee. But he said that they were reluctant to testify and had . returned to Myanmar for fear of being implicated in the crime. 'If they go to court and speak as witnesses, they'll have . problems with the Thai police and Thai bosses,' Kyaw Thaung told . reporters in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city. Thai Police Major General Suwat Jaengyordsuk, defended the . investigation, which he led, and said Myanmar was welcome to . present witnesses. Win Zaw Htun (left) and Zaw Lin (right) both 21,initially confessed to the murders but later retracted theirconfessions saying they had been beaten and threatened by Thai police . The workers pleaded not guilty on December 8 to charges including . conspiracy to commit murder and rape. The first hearing in the . case will take place on December 26. 'Whatever the Thai government decides in this case, we . believe these two young people did not commit this crime,' said . Htoo Chit, the Myanmar committee's spokesman. The murders of the two tourists dealt a blow to Thailand's vital tourism industry, which generates almost 10 per cent of the  gross domestic product. The country was already struggling to recover from months of political upheaval that culminated in a May 22 coup, with the unrest keeping some visitors away, and the government called on police to solve the case quickly. But human rights groups have accused Thai authorities of using the men as scapegoats. Win Zaw Htun (left) and Zaw Lin (right )took part in a reconstruction on Koh Tao, Thailand, after Thai police said DNA from the men matched samples found on victims . The two suspects were paraded in front of cameras after apparently making murder confessions, but it was reported that a Burmese embassy official later formally retracted their confessions amid allegations the pair were tortured. In November British detectives traveled to Thailand to review the police investigation into the murders after widespread criticism of blunders including allowing reporters to trample over the crime scene. But last month, the victims' families said they had seen strong evidence against the suspects and expressed confidence in the case. 'There is a great deal of detail and vast areas of investigative work which has been shared with us,' Ms Witheridge's family said in a statement released through Britain's Foreign Office. David Miller (left), 24, from Jersey, and 23-year-old Hannah Witheridge (right), from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, were found dead on a beach on the island of Ko Tao on September 15 . 'We would like to stress that as a family we are confident in the work that has been carried out into these atrocious crimes.' Mr Miller's family has urged restraint from rights groups and the media while the court case unfolds. 'The support for the Myanmar suspects has been strong and vocal, but please do not jump to conclusions until you have considered the evidence from both sides in full,' Miller's family said in its statement. They added: 'They must respond to these charges, and their arguments must be considered with the same scrutiny as those of the prosecution. 'Please remember that this is above all a story of two wonderful young people, David and Hannah, killed in the prime of their lives in a senseless and brutal way.'

"We know an industry is in crisis when its top institutions cannot establish stable leadership. That is the case with some of our nation's best public universities today. When the Board of Visitors at the University of Virginia pressured President Teresa Sullivan to resign on June 10, she became the fourth leader of a flagship public university to leave office under a cloud of controversy recently. The other casualties included the highly respected leaders of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the University of Illinois and the University of Oregon. The president of the University of California at Berkeley has also announced that he will step down in December. Leaders of public universities in other states face equally strong pressures to go. The men and women in these jobs seem to have a target on their backs. This can't go on. Our nation's public universities are the heart and soul of our higher education system, which is the envy of the world. Flagship public universities educate more of the brightest high school students than private universities in many states. They conduct the lion's share of advanced research. They also attract the largest number of foreign students. If our public universities fall into a decline because of a leadership vacuum, then our entire system will decline, too. University leaders are an endangered species because they are wedged between opposing and powerful pressures that are undermining public universities. Government officials in state capitals want to cut funding while requiring far-reaching reforms. They demand more control over costs that have risen much faster than inflation or family income in the last decade. They also ask for increased public access to flagship universities through traditional and online forms of education. Governors and legislators want all these benefits as they continue to reduce state expenditures for higher education. Professors and administrators on campus view these reforms as attacks on serious education and research. Advanced training in the sciences, engineering and humanities requires intensive small-group work that cannot be subjected to assembly-line efficiencies. Anyone who has taught writing, for example, knows that there is no substitute for the instructor sitting with the student and going line-by-line through each sentence. The same is true for theoretical physics, medicine, law and many other fields. You need extended time and personal contact for young minds to mature as effective thinkers. That is expensive, but it is money well spent for the good of the society. It's the same for advanced research. Innovation and creativity require freedom, security and flexibility. Scholars must have the ability to pursue a question in depth and examine its many implications. Sometimes an important project may take years to complete. Without university research of this kind we would not have many of the technologies and medicines we take for granted today. Governors and legislators have a strong argument about the elitism, the inefficiency and the sometime self-serving nature of university faculty. Professors have a strong case for the merits of what they do, and the remarkable record of achievements and historical job-creation coming out of our best public universities. The system works for some, but not for everyone. The system produces value, but at costs that might not be sustainable. University leaders are caught in the middle. Governors are impatient for new ""efficiencies."" Professors are adamant about protecting the freedom necessary for their work. University presidents have the title to address these issues, but they have little power when funding is tight and the two sides are equally uncompromising. No one wants to acknowledge the legitimacy of the other side's point of view. Wealthy alumni groups are very generous and loyal to their alma maters, but they cannot solve this crisis. Although alumni want their universities to be the best in the world, their support (as generous as it may be) cannot replace government money. Despite steep decreases in state funding for universities, state and federal agencies provide the largest share of money to public universities for research and related activities. The National Institutes of Health, for example, is the dominant funder for medical research in the world. States own the land on which public university campuses are built. So where do we go from here? Reforms to public universities are indeed necessary, but they will not emerge effectively from political attacks and vindictive cuts. What we need is an open and participatory process where university boards, state leaders, faculty, students and campus presidents formulate measurable goals for reasonable reforms, cost-savings, and more efficiency. These discussions should also include meaningful incentives for increased excellence (in teaching and research), public accessibility and international recognition. University presidents should be empowered to pursue these goals, in a reasonable time frame, with transparent accountability. While faculty must preserve the essential freedoms for their creativity, they cannot expect to do this by protecting privileges at all costs. Along with administrators, they have to accept changes to their comfortable routines. If both state and campus communities contribute to mutually beneficial changes, the reformed public university of the 21st century will be much improved. At present, the attacks on university leaders from all sides are attacks on the very idea of a public university. When Thomas Jefferson designed the University of Virginia, and when Abraham Lincoln created the federal land-grant system to finance public education, they had a faith that the most advanced intellectual work would improve the nation as a whole. That is what they meant by the ""public"" in university. Jefferson and Lincoln's support for public higher education made the United States a model for the rest of the world. We need leaders in government and on campus with the same vision -- the same desire to use limited resources not as instruments for political or personal advantage, but as opportunities for constructive engagement and the greatest long-term public good. Public universities need protection and they also need serious, thoughtful reform. Let's start with giving university presidents a fair chance to do their work.","Jeremi Suri: Some of the best public universities in America are losing their presidents .

He says reforms to these institutions are needed, but political attacks and budget cuts won't help .

"The grieving family of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 have criticised the timing of a new book that claims the plane may have been accidentally shot down and the search for survivors covered up. The family of missing Brisbane man Rod Burrows say they are at pains to understand how still, after 71 days of ongoing global search efforts, no one knows what happened to the missing plane which vanished on March 8 and how a book could be released so soon after. Flight MH370: The Mystery makes the incredible claim that the airline was shot down by US-Thai joint strike fighters accidentally as part of a training drill gone horribly wrong. The book goes on to claim the search party was purposely  sent in the wrong direction as part of a cover up. Scroll down for video . Flight MH370 has been missing since March 8 - but could have transmitted a GPS fix on its location if its tracking software had received a £6 upgrade, it's been claimed . Huge task: The search for MH370 is the most expensive and extensive ever undertaken . Investigation: The book weighs all the theories about what happened to MH370 . Irene Burrows, Rod's mother, told the Sun Herald that the book had been released too soon, and that despite the speculation, it offers no concrete answers. 'There's absolutely no answers,' she said. 'It's devastating for the families, it's been 10 weeks tomorrow and there's nothing.' She said both her and husband George are still trying to comprehend what happened, and that a book full of conspiracies released just 71 days after its disappearance, does nothing to alleviate the pain of losing their son. But according to the book's author, Nigel Cawthorne, there may never be a clear answer. He writes in the book how the Burrows, and hundreds more in their situation, will 'almost certainly' never know the real story behind how the ill-fated plane vanished on March 8. He writes: 'Did they die painlessly, unaware of their fate? Or did they die in terror in a flaming wreck, crashing from the sky in the hands of a madman?' It is then that Cawthorne makes the incredible assertion that the plane was shot down accidentally over the South China Sea by a joint US-Thai joint strike fighter team, and the searchers sent in the wrong direction as part of a cover up. He describes how a man, while working on an oil rig in the ocean at about the same time the plane's transponder went off, saw a burning plane and how this was right near the military exercise being conducted with personel from various other countries. He claims that these countries may have then sent searchers in the wrong direction in order to cover their tracks. 'After all, no wreckage has been found in the South Indian Ocean, which in itself is suspicious.' He said with the amount of disinformation regarding MH370, it is best to be skeptical. Cawthorne also raises more doubt into toe plane's disappearance, claiming it could have been located if its tracking software had been upgraded - something that costs just £6 ($10) per flight. According to Cawthorne the Boeing 777-200ER had a ‘data package’ that only transmitted the most basic flight information, so authorities weren’t able to get a GPS fix on it. For just $10, however, this package could have been improved, the book says, resulting in far more detailed information about the 777's movements being pinged. ‘For US$10, you could have told within half an hour’s flying time where the plane would have gone,’ a source told the paper. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, meanwhile, has called for real-time tracking of planes and improvements to their communication systems to prevent a repeat of the 370 tragedy. In an opinion piece published on Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal, Najib called for changes that would ‘make it harder for an aircraft to simply disappear, and easier to find any aircraft that did.’ ‘One of the most astonishing things about this tragedy is the revelation that an airliner the size of a Boeing 777 can vanish, almost without a trace. In an age of smartphones and mobile Internet, real-time tracking of commercial airplanes is long overdue,’ he said. Inmarsat Plc, a British provider of global mobile satellite communications services, said Monday it will offer free basic tracking services for planes flying over oceans. The service will be available to most of the world's long-haul commercial fleet. The Malaysian plane sent a signal to an Inmarsat satellite, but not location data. Engineers conducted a novel analysis of those signals to determine the plane's flight path, but the effort took time. Australia's Ocean Shield is carrying a robot submarine, the Bluefin 21, to survey the ocean floor for MH370's black box . Najib also urged the aviation industry to consider changing planes' communications systems so that they can't be disabled midair. The government has said someone severed the plane's communication systems with the ground and deliberately diverted Flight 370. He said the capacity of the cockpit data recorder, one of a plane's two black boxes, should be extended from two hours currently to recording the entire flight, while its location beacons should be made to last at least 90 days, instead of 30 days now. ‘The global aviation industry must not only learn the lessons of MH370 but implement them,’ he added. Najib reiterated that Flight 370 was one of world's greatest aviation mysteries. ‘Nobody saw this coming, nobody knows why it happened, and nobody knows precisely where it is,’ he said. He said the government has done its best but admitted there were mistakes in the early days of the crisis, with a disorderly public communication and a slow start to search efforts. He said an independent investigation is ongoing so the government can learn from mistakes. A Malaysia Airlines employee writes a message expressing prayers and well-wishes for passengers of MH370 at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport mosque . Najib assured families of passengers that Malaysia will ‘keep searching for the plane for as long as it takes.’ Australia is leading the search, which is moving into a second phase in which commercial underwater operators will be contracted to scour a vast expanse of seabed with sonar equipment looking for wreckage for the next one year. An Australian ship on Tuesday returned to the area where underwater sounds consistent with black boxes were heard in April, the search coordination center said. The ship had returned to port briefly to be resupplied. The Ocean Shield is carrying a robot submarine, the Bluefin 21, to survey the ocean floor. A spokeswoman for John Blake, the publishers of the book, said: . “The tragic disappearance of Flight MH370 is an extraordinary and terrible . mystery. Inevitably hundreds of wild theories are circulating about what has . really happened. 'Nigel Cawthorne is a serious and highly respected author and . journalist. He has spent weeks scientifically analysing all the available data . to produce the book, which is a serious and measured . study of this tragedy.”","New book Flight MH370: The Mystery claims the plane was shot down accidentally and its tracks covered up .

"Mr Nasheed was succeeded by then Vice-President Mohamed Waheed, who denies that a coup took place and says the transition was legal and necessary after the former leader resigned.
Maldives saw its first multi-party presidential elections in 2008, before which it was ruled for 30 years by Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who is still said to have an influence on politics.
The first round of the election will be held on 7 September. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the votes, then a second round, or run-off, will be held.
According to the Election Commission, 240,302 people (above 18 years of age) are registered to vote, including 31,000 newly registered voters and 65,745 who have registered to vote at a location other than their home island.
In the 2008 elections there were about 209,000 registered voters, with an 85% turnout in the first round, and 86% in the second.
Parliamentary polls are to be held in 2014.
There are four candidates in the bid for the presidency: former President Mohamed Nasheed, incumbent President Mohamed Waheed, business tycoon Gasim Ibrahim and former President Gayoom's half-brother Abdulla Yameen.
Mr Nasheed leads the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), which is the single largest party with the highest number of registered members.
Mr Nasheed was the Maldives' first democratically elected president. His 2008 election win brought an end to Mr Gayoom's 30-year rule.
His running mate Mustafa Lutfi is a veteran politician and a former education minister. Mr Nasheed is seen as a strong contender.
Incumbent President Mohamed Waheed's Gaumee Itthihaad Party leads a coalition which includes the Dhivehi Rayithunge Party (DRP) and its leader Ahmed Thasmeen Ali, who is also Waheed's running mate.
Former President Gayoom's half-brother Abdulla Yameen is standing for the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM), the second-largest party both inside and outside the parliament.
His running mate Mohamed Jameel Ahmed is a former home minister and a vocal opponent of Nasheed.
Gasim Ibrahim is the presidential candidate of the Jumhooree Party. The prominent businessman heads the Villa Group of companies, described as one of the largest private conglomerates in the Maldives.
He is also said to be popular for his philanthropic work. Mr Ibrahim's party is contesting the election in coalition with the Dhivehi Qaumee Party (DQP) which is known for its opposition to the former Nasheed administration. Mr Ibrahim has picked the DQP's Hassan Saeed as his running mate.
Candidates have been largely focusing on religion, nationalism, economy and education in their election campaigns.
Mr Nasheed's party is focusing on economic development through reforms and tourism.
The MDP manifesto pledges tax reform, development projects and the setting up of a national development bank.
Other parties are using religion as a political tool to woo voters.
President Waheed's campaign promises to promote the teaching of Islam and to encourage religious thought and teachings. Other key areas include social protection, education and the environment.
Mr Gasim's manifesto also proposes to strengthen Islam in the Maldives, including the establishment of an Islamic university and making the Koran a mandatory school subject. Mr Gasim has also pledged to pursue oil exploration, increase taxes on the wealthy and provide laptops for students.
Mr Gasim's coalition includes the religious conservative Adhaalath Party. The alliance means that a win for Mr Gasim could bring the country closer to the party's dream of turning the Maldives into an Islamic state.
Mr Yameen has taken a strong position on law and order, campaigning in favour of implementing the death penalty and calling for harsher prison sentences.
Independent poll monitors, including teams from Transparency Maldives and the Commonwealth Secretariat, will observe the elections.
India has also said that it will send a team of former chief election commissioners as observers.
The controversial power transfer in 2012 has led many to question the legitimacy of the polls.
Concerns also remain over whether the nascent democracy will be able to sustain itself, given a background where the judiciary and military are said to function under heavy political influence.
Transparency Maldives, a non-governmental organisation, has warned that the election will take place against a backdrop of ""uncertainty of democratic transition, existing polarisations and other challenges that have been aggravated by the controversial transfer of power on 7 February 2012"".
India and China have been trying to extend their influence in the region and the Maldives' strategic location drives their engagement with the tiny island nation.
India arguably enjoyed greater influence in the Maldives under Mr Nasheed. Bilateral ties suffered a setback after President Waheed's administration evicted Indian infrastructure giant GMR which had been developing Male's airport under an agreement signed with Mr Nasheed's government.
India is also mindful of China's expanding military and economic footprint in the Maldives.

"By . Ray Massey . PUBLISHED: . 21:25 EST, 25 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:17 EST, 26 September 2012 . If the drudgery of the daily commute has lost its charm, businessman Jeremy Paxton may have the high-octane antidote. He's started doing his treks to the office on an amazing water-powered jet pack that appears to owe more to the technology of James Bond and Buzz Lightyear than the Clapham omnibus. Instead of getting the car out of the garage or heading to the bus stop, he straps on the device, which uses water pressure to lift him up to 30ft in the air and propel him along horizontally at speeds of up to 25mph. Scroll down for demo!... To infinity and be-Bond! Jeremy Paxton shows off his 007-style jet pack which he uses to commute to work . Water way to travel: The jet pack can lift Mr Paxton up to 30ft in the air and propel him horizontally at speeds of up to 25mph . He says the 40-mile journey from his riverside boathouse home in Marpledurham near Reading to his office at the Lower Mill Estate in the Cotswolds is possible because the River Thames and waterways run direct between the two. Though he does have to walk the last three minutes to his office. Mr Paxton, 51, has also been asked to be the UK's 'test pilot' and to compile a 'Pilot User Guide' for other would-be customers. But the fun comes at a price. The jet pack, which is imported from Germany where it is made under license from American company JetLev, will set you back a cool £115,000 – enough to buy an Aston Martin V8 Vantage for 007 and still have change for a few gadgets. Who needs the car: The 51-year-old uses the device to travel from his riverside boathouse home in Marpledurham near Reading to his office at the Lower Mill Estate in the Cotswolds . A practical plaything: Depending on the pilot's weight, a JetLev Flyer can top speeds of 30mph and cruise for between two to three hours before refueling, with a range of around 80 miles . The jet pack is not a rocket. Instead it operates on the same principle as a giant pump by generating huge amounts of water pressure to provide a thrust similar to that of a fireman’s hose. Mr Paxton, whose business interests include the Lower Mill Estate in Gloucestershire, an upmarket 600-acre waterside community of eco-friendly luxury second-homes in the Cotswolds, said: 'I’m the first person in Britain to buy one. I just like alternative means of transport. 'It’s a different way to commute. It’s better than sitting in a traffic jam or being stuck on a crowded train. It’s environmentally-friendly. 'It’s fantastic fun and it’s not complicated to operate. I often commute to London by train and sometimes take my boat to the station. I have a pilot’s licence and fly planes and helicopters. Why not this?’ 00-heaven: The jet pack, designed by Chinese-born Canadian Raymond Li, was inspired by the one used by James Bond in the opening scenes of the 1965 film Thunderball (right) A Toy Story: The jet pack is not too dissimilar to the backpack used by Buzz Lightyear (right) The jet pack comprises a number of key parts. First, there is the pack itself which resembles the one used by James Bond in Thunderball or by Buzz Lightyear in the movie Toy Story. This is connected to a 33ft hose which in turn is connected to a boat-like flotation device, inside which is a 250cc four-stroke petrol motor. The 'boat' is the pump generator and sits in the water sucking up vast quantities of water which are then forced through the hose and into the jet nozzles on a special lightweight carbon-fibre frame weighing 30lbs strapped to the pilot’s back. The sheer force of this jet lifts the pilot off the ground or out of the water. He or she then controls the speed by a motor-cycle-style twist-grip on one of the handles. Direction is just like flying and depends on the pilot shifting his or her weight. The maximum altitude is limited by the length of the tube, which also limits the distance from water a pilot can travel. A digital fly-by-wire system is used to . control the throttle which the makers say make flight controls simple, . light and intuitive. Mr Paxton added: 'It’s entirely buoyant so it won’t sink. You can go 30ft high or hover over the water – even walk on the water. 'If . you want to go right you put down your right hand you can do tight . turns. After a few goes, you get the hang of it It’s like riding a . bicycle. You have a ""kill switch"" around your wrist to cut the power.' Inspired by the jet pack used in the . opening scenes of Thunderball, the Jetlev is the brainchild of Raymond . Li, a Chinese-born Canadian who first . sketched out his concept on a yellow Post-it Note in 2000 and spent the . next 10 years developing it. The makers say that, depending on pilot weight, a standard JetLev Flyer could top speeds of 30mph and cruise for between two to three hours before refueling with a range of around 80 miles. It can accommodate pilots of 1.5metres to 2metres in height and between 40kg and 150kg in weight. Mr Paxton is himself a keen flyer who has his own aeroplane and helicopter. Earlier this month, he abseiled down London’s new Shard skyscraper with the Duke of York in aid of charity. The makers say basic skills can be mastered in just 15 minutes though intermediate skills will take between one and 10 hours. Pioneer: Mr Paxton has been asked to be the UK's 'test pilot' and to compile a Pilot User Guide for other would-be customers . Price: £115,000 . Maximum altitude: 30ft . Top speed: circa 30mph . Cruising duration: 2 to 3 hours . Range:Around 80 miles . Weight of jet-pack harness: 30lbs . Jetpack height: 3ft 2in . Width: 2ft 11ins . Length: 2ft . Power: 250cc four-cylinder petrol engine . ‘Boat’ length: 10ft 7 inches . Height: 2ft 3 inches . Weight: 649 lbs . Jetlev’s website notes: ‘As soon as sufficient lift is applied, you and the jetpack become weightless and levitate in the air and even small amounts of force will move or turn you. 'You will feel some pressure from the saddle and the trapeze, but usually no more than from riding a bicycle.’ But pilots must be 18 years old. And Jetlev cautions: ‘You must be a good swimmer and should not feel uncomfortable having your face in the water from time to time. 'You should not have a fear of heights. 'You should be in good health and physical condition. 'You should have no history of any heart conditions and flying is not advised for women who are pregnant.’ Last month, hotel manager Grant Engler, 25, and his fiancé and Amanda Volf tied the knot in the world’s first jet pack wedding at a ceremony in the U.S. They each flew to the beachside ceremony at Newport Beach in California wearing Jetlev water-powered jet pack. After exchanging vows the newlyweds performed an airborne first dance - above the water - to Frank Sinatra’s ‘Come Fly With Me’. The daring couple, from Grand Rapids, Michigan, became engaged on an adventure holiday to Mexico in April.","Jeremy Paxton, 51, uses £115k device to make 40-mile journey along Thames .

"Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum holds an AR-15 assault rifle at a shooting range during his presidential campaign on January 30, 2016. Brian Frank/Reuters 
  
 Over the weekend, Rick Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator and Republican who previously ran for president, suggested that student protestors should learn CPR instead of pushing for stricter gun control laws. Now he's walking back the statement. 
  
 ""How about kids — instead of looking to someone else to solve their problem — do something about maybe taking CPR classes or trying to deal with situations that, when there is a violent shooter, that you can actually respond to that?"" Santorum, who is also a CNN commentator, said during a Sunday broadcast of the network's show ""State of the Union."" 
  
 On Wednesday, Santorum told CNN, ""I did misspeak in using the term CPR."" He also noted that gun control advocacy has helped bolster ""organizations and people who have actually focused on what we can do ... to actually prevent these types of things."" 
  
 Santorum made his original remarks over the weekend while roughly two million people at hundreds of ""March for Our Lives"" events across the US rallied against gun violence in America. 
  
 The student-led protests commenced after 17 people were shot to death at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. In the February 14 mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, a 19-year-old former student is believed to have committed the murders using a legally purchased AR-15 assault rifle. 
  
 David Hogg, a survivor of that school shooting and a ""March for Our Lives"" organizer, responded to Santorum's remarks in a broadcast on CNN. 
  
 ""There are many programs that work to ensure, especially in communities that are heavily affected by gun violence, [...] that students are able to respond and administer whatever first aid they can, assuming the person is still alive,"" Hogg said on Sunday. ""But at the end of the day, if you take a bullet from an AR-15 to the head, no amount of CPR is going to save you because you're dead."" 
  
 Medical doctors on Twitter joined Hogg's criticism of Santorum's remarks, noting that CPR is often futile following gunshot wounds. 
  
 ""Gobsmackingly uninformed,"" tweeted Dr. Heather Sher, a radiologist in Florida. ""CPR is not effective with catastrophic bleeding."" 
  
 Joseph Sakran, a trauma surgeon at Johns Hopkins Medicine and self-described gun violence survivor, tweeted: ""Victims that go into cardiac arrest after #GunViolence are Bleeding to Death. CPR is NOT effective in this situation."" 
  
 Santorum did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

 To humanely probe the physics of gunshot wounds, and ultimately help police solve crimes and doctors save lives, researchers shoot bullets into inert, flesh-like substances. 
  
 In many cases, they use a large block of synthetic gelatin and water to simulate the impact of a speeding bullet on human tissue. 
  
 Here's an example from the YouTube channel EffectiveAffect of what a gunshot simulation in gelatin looks like. This bullet was moving at about 2,900 feet per second through 575 cubic inches of gelatin. 
  
 Many factors determine how damaging bullet wounds can be. The type of gun and bullet used, the range of the shot, where on the body a person was shot, and whether or not the bullet exited the body afterward all make a difference. 
  
 But some basic principles remain: When a bullet is traveling at supersonic speeds, it partially slows down the moment it hits a person. The energy of the blast needs to go somewhere, so it radiates outward from the bullet's path to the surrounding tissues. This creates a much larger ""mushrooming"" effect, which you can see above. 
  
 This temporary ballooning of tissue is actually what causes the most damage, according to a post on Mongabay.com. The billowing flesh lacerates blood vessels and surrounding organs, tissues, and bone. 
  
 The Washington Post reported in June 2017 that this shockwave can leave a track of wounding as much as ""five to 10 times wider than the bullet."" 
  
 Gelatin isn't a perfect proxy for the human body. We have bones and cartilage, which can skew the bullet's path, sending it into a tailspin that could cause it to break apart and get lodged in different spaces, further complicating the severity of the wound. 
  
 This why an increasing number of researchers are turning to advanced computer simulations. Such models can recreate the complex layers of tissue in the human body to study a practically infinite number of grievous wounds from all angles, speeds, and styles of bullets (or even shrapnel from mines and improvised explosive devices). 
  
 A model that debuted in 2015, for example, simulated a human leg, its skin, muscle, bone, large arteries, and even small veins. Then it applied the physics of fluid dynamics to explore the origins of traumatic blood loss, and the best methods to stop that bleeding. 
  
 But as Alex Ossola reported for Popular Science, this and other models aren't perfect — so there's still a lot left for scientists and doctors to learn. This makes gunshot wounds as enigmatic as they are damaging and dangerous.

 CNN commentator Rick Santorum said Wednesday that he misspoke last Sunday when he said survivors of a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, should have taken CPR classes in response to the attack instead of “looking to someone else to solve their problem.” 
  
 “The fact of the matter is I did misspeak in using the term CPR and I think Sanjay Gupta’s job here at CNN is probably safe as being the medical commentator on things,” Santorum, a former Republican senator and presidential candidate, said on CNN’s “New Day.” 
  
 Story Continued Below 
  
 Santorum’s initial comment suggesting that school shooting survivors learn CPR came one day after thousands gathered in Washington and in cities across the country for March for Our Lives rallies calling for stricter gun control laws. Those rallies were prompted by last month’s shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a gunman killed 17 people. 
  
 Santorum was widely rebuked for his CPR comments. Students who lived through the shooting, and even doctors, weighed in publicly, telling the former senator that CPR would not have saved the lives of the victims.

 Santorum said his comment about CPR “obscured the larger point” that past mass shootings have spawned organizations that he said have done significant work in combating school shootings by addressing mental health issues and bullying. Calls for divisive steps to impose stricter gun control laws obscure the work that such organizations do, Santorum said. 
  
 “What I’ve seen happen here is avoiding the issues that are really actually unifying,” he continued. “I mean, that's really the most disturbing thing.” 
  
  |||||","– A radiologist in Florida called it ""gobsmackingly uninformed"" and a trauma surgeon at Johns Hopkins said it's ""not effective in this situation,"" and on Wednesday Rick Santorum walked it back, Business Insider reports. Having watched hundreds of thousands of people march in support of gun control a day earlier, the former Republican senator said Sunday that the survivors of the school shooting in Parkland should take CPR classes ""instead of looking to someone else to solve their problems,"" CNN reports. The comment earned Santorum instant criticism from doctors and Parkland survivors alike. ""If you take a bullet from an AR-15 to the head, no amount of CPR is going to save you,"" Parkland survivor David Hogg said. Others pointed out that stopping the bleeding is the pressing concern for a gunshot victim. “The fact of the matter is I did misspeak in using the term CPR,"" Politico quotes Santorum as saying Wednesday. He says he ""obscured the larger point"" by mentioning CPR. That larger point being that students are being divisive by focusing on gun control instead of mental health and bullying. “What I’ve seen happen here is avoiding the issues that are really actually unifying,” he says. “I mean, that's really the most disturbing thing.” A woman who lost her mother in the Sandy Hook shooting disagrees. ""Rick Santorum's words are an insult to the kids of Parkland, my family, and to the countless others who have had loved ones taken by gun violence,"" Erica Lafferty of Everytown for Gun Safety tells CNN. ""For anyone to suggest that the solution to gun violence is for kids to learn CPR is outrageous."""
"Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan have  made a formal complaint to the police after online rape threats were made against their daughter, Chloe. The television presenters said they had handed over 'a substantial amount of evidence' to the police. a week after their 27-year-old daughter was targeted by online trolls over the Ched Evans rape case. And they said detectives had 'launched an immediate investigation' as a result. Chloe was threatened with rape on Twitter after she defended comments made by Finnigan during a debate around the future of of the footballer rapist, in which her mother said his crime was 'non violent' and did not cause 'bodily harm'. Madeley, left, and Finnigan have complained to police about online rape threats to their daughter, Chloe, right . Madeley and Finnigan released a statement today, above, saying Scotland Yard had launched an investigation . Twitter trolls turned on Chloe after her mother appeared to defend rapist Ched Evans, right, on Loose Women . Today Chloe's parents put a statement on their website saying: 'Following legal advice, our family has now made a formal complaint to the Metropolitan Police about cyber-stalking, harassment and, most recently, rape threats made against Chloe on Twitter. 'We have presented the police with a substantial amount of evidence, and they have launched an immediate investigation. 'We will be making no further comment at this time.' The furore began when Finnigan, 66, appeared on ITV's Loose Women shortly before Evans was released from jail a week ago after serving two and a half years for raping a 19-year-old woman. Finnigan argued that the 26-year-old should be allowed to resume his playing career on his release from jail because, while the attack was 'unpleasant', his victim was drunk. She also said: 'The rape – and I am not, please, by any means minimising any kind of rape – but the rape was not violent. He didn’t cause any bodily harm to the person.' Under the Malicious Communications Act 1988, any 'indecent or grossly offensive' message that causes 'distress or anxiety' to the recipient can lead to prosecution. The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than £2,500. Since the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet, e-mail and social networking, prosecutors have used a number of different laws to charge Twitter trolls. Student Liam Stacey, who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed, was charged under the Crime and Disorder Act. Two men jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the Serious Crime Act, and Paul Chambers, who joked he would blow Doncaster airport 'sky high' was charged under the Communications Act 2003. Earlier this month, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling revealed to The Mail on Sunday that the maximum six month sentence for internet abuse will be quadrupled . The tougher new legislation is already being dubbed ‘Chloe’s Law’ after Miss Madeley's public stance against the disturbing messages. Her comments provoked a storm on social media sites, with campaigners accusing her of perpetuating harmful myths about rape. Finnigan apologised several times for causing offence, insisting that rape was 'an appalling crime', and saying she was merely discussing 'the legal facts of the case'. But the trolls merely turned on her daughter, with one saying: 'Judy's given me her blessing to rape you.' Another tweet, directed at her mother, said: 'Hope you discover first hand what rape is like you idiot.' In a message put up via Twitter, Chloe said: 'My mother was voicing an opinion on the matter of criminals being accepted back into society. 'The comments she made on the case in question were facts, so not opinions. 'While it may anger some that the term ""non-violent rape"" exists, unfortunately it does. 'Referencing it and explaining why that was the charge does not mean that you think this category of rape is acceptable. 'To believe that my mother is pro ""non-violent rape"" is ridiculous and I am shocked that many people have jumped to this conclusion. 'To the trolls wishing rape on me, stop, you are utterly pathetic.' At the time, Madeley used Twitter to warn the trolls he would go to police, saying: ''I have noted every sick troll threat. 'Do they really think it's ok to wish/threaten rape on a woman?  They're in deep trouble, trust me.' He added: 'Trolls who sent sick rape threats?  Prosecution awaits you.' A Scotland Yard spokesman said today: 'An allegation of harassment was made to Barnet police relating to messages received via a social media site. Targeted: Stella Creasy MP, left, and historian Mary Beard, right, have both been victims of online trolling . 'A criminal investigation has commenced.  There are no arrests at this stage but enquiries continue.' Last month Peter Nunn, a 33-year-old delivery driver from Bristol, was jailed for 18 weeks for using Twitter to threaten to rape Labour MP Stella Creasy in response to her backing of a campaign to put Jane Austen on the £10 note. Historian Mary Beard was trolled after she appeared on television, with one troll, Cambridge student Oliver Rawlings, 20, calling her a 'filthy old slut'. She later accepted his invitation to lunch to apologise, and said afterwards: 'He is going to find it hard to get a job, because as soon as you Google his name, that is what comes up.' Rape in Britain is an offence under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which came into force a decade ago, replacing and refining previous legislation. One of the key changes under the new Act was to define consent.  A person consents if they agree to have sex by choice, and if they have the freedom and capacity to make that choice. Therefore in a situation where a victim had sex when they were incapacitated by drink, the law would say that they did not have the freedom or capacity to make the choice, ie did not consent. The law does not require the victim to have physically resisted in order to prove a lack of consent.

"Wayne Rooney, Mario Balotelli and Frank Lampard are successful footballers because their faces are the optimum shape. That’s according to new research, which compared the facial-width-to-height ratios (FWHRs) of high-ranking footballers to their on-pitch record. It discovered that players with faces that are wider than they are tall are more likely to score goals, but also commit fouls. Wayne Rooney (left) and Mario Balotelli (right) are successful footballers because their faces are the optimum shape, claims new research. Experts discovered that players with a high facial-width-to-height ratios (FWHRs) are more likely to score goals, but also commit fouls . The Manchester United star, nicknamed Shrek because of the shape of his head, has the features that mark out the best forwards from the rest, claim experts from the University of Colorado at Boulder. Mr Rooney, who will be awarded with a Golden Cap at Wembley on Saturday to mark his 100th appearance for England, has also received six red cards in his career. While Italian Mr Balotelli has scored 33 goals in his international career, but has also received 50 yellow cards in his career for fouls and other offences. Dr Keith Welker from the university analysed 1,000 players from 32 countries at the 2010 South Africa World Cup. Researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder analysed 1,000 players from 32 countries at the 2010 South Africa World Cup. They measured each of the players' faces on a FWHR chart (pictured). FWHR is the distance between the cheekbones divided by the distance between the mid-brow and the upper lip . Footballer Peter Crouch (left) has a low-ratio face, while Frank Lampard's face scores higher on the FWHR scale. Both midfielders and forwards with greater FWHRs were more likely to commit fouls . He measured each of their faces on a FWHR chart. Both midfielders and forwards with greater FWHRs were more likely to commit fouls. Forwards with higher FWHRs also were more likely to score or lay on goals, according to the findings published in the journal Adaptive Human Behaviour and Physiology. A recent report found that men with wider faces earn around £1,300 more than those with narrow faces when asking for a bonus. However, researchers from the University of California said this comes with a compromise, as wide-faced people fared less well when it came to business negotiations. A separate study from Singapore Management University found that women are drawn to men with broader faces for short-term relationships, but they do not tend to see them as husband material. This could be because men with wider faces are perceived to be more dominant and aggressive. While this may initially make them appear desirable, they are less appealing traits in a long-term partner. ‘Previous research into facial structure of athletes has been primarily in the United States and Canada,’ said Dr Welker. ‘No-one had really looked at how facial-width-to-height ratio is associated with athletic performance by comparing people from across the world.’ FWHR is the distance between the cheekbones divided by the distance between the mid-brow and the upper lip. Past studies have shown a high FWHR is associated with more aggressive behaviour. For example, high FWHR is associated with greater antisocial and unethical behaviour, but also greater success among CEOs and achievement drive among US presidents.

However, researchers from the University of California said this comes with a compromise, as wide-faced people fared less well when it came to business negotiations.

Scientists have several ideas about how FWHR may be associated with aggression. One possibility is it is related to testosterone exposure earlier in life . Dr Welker said: ‘There are a lot of athletic data out there. ‘We were exploring contexts to look at aggressive behaviour and found the World Cup, which quantifies goals, fouls and assists, provides a multinational way of addressing whether facial structure produces this aggressive behaviour and performance.’ The theory also applies to other sports, such as rugby and cycling.

It goes on sale for the first time today, but it seems the latest face cream that promises miraculous results is already a sellout hit with women. Some 15,000 have downloaded vouchers online for a sample of the Forever Light Creator anti-ageing cream, which claims to give you a ‘flawless complexion’ by using the reflection of light. And more than 3,000 have reserved the product, made by Yves Saint Laurent. In fact, its makers claim, demand is so high that they have set up a helpline for those who discover their nearest pharmacy has run out. The product comes as a lotion or a serum and is said to even out the skin’s complexion and remove dark spots and shadows. It apparently contains three types of sugars called glycans which reflect light and make the skin more radiant. Glycans occur naturally in our skin but gradually decline as we age, which is partly why our complexion becomes duller, less flexible and more uneven. The creams cost from £35 to £82, depending on the size of the bottle, and are aimed at women over 25. Amandine Ohayon, general manager of Yves Saint Laurent, said the product was a ‘world first’ which had taken three years to develop. ‘Our research has shown that women are now more concerned about age spots and uneven skin tone than they are about wrinkles,’ she said. ‘Forever Light Creator recreates truly luminous skin. It also significantly reduces the appearance of age spots, the tell-tale areas of darker pigmentation which distinguish an older face from the smooth, uniform complexion of youth, and gives skin a flawless look.’ The manufacturers claim that after one week of using the cream skin is ‘noticeably’ improved, and after two months red and dark spots will lighten and the complexion will become ‘more uniform’. Face of youth: Model Josephine Skriver advertises the product which is so popular that Yves Saint Laurent has set up a helpline for women whose local pharmacy runs out . But experts dismissed such promises and said it was usually impossible for any cream to banish all blemishes. Dr Ross Perry, a cosmetic surgeon for Cosmedics Skin Clinics, said: ‘Skin tone and pigmentation are so subjective. ‘There is no miracle treatment. As soon as you go back into the sun or get a bit of a tan, all pigmentation will come back. You can reduce it but it can easily return.’ He added: ‘Even the medically based products that have been clinically proven have a limited efficacy for removing pigmentation.’ Dr Sam Bunting, a cosmetic dermatologist based in Harley Street, said: ‘I don’t know of any topical non-prescription product that will make a major impact on red areas, which usually reflect the presence of dilated blood vessels in the skin as a consequence of either sun damage or rosacea.’","Forever Light Creator by Yves Saint Laurent costs between £35 and £82 .

Saturday's 2-0 home loss to Hamilton left the Dens Park club in the relegation play-off position.
""I'm disappointed not to have got the chance to see out the season because I firmly believe we would have retained our Premiership status,"" Hartley said.
But Dundee managing director John Nelms said: ""Unfortunately, the business we are in, sometimes change is necessary to achieve the goals we have set.""
With five games remaining to climb out of the bottom two, Nelms informed the players of Hartley's departure today.
""I want to thank Paul for his time with the club,"" he added in a club statement.
""I think somebody in the near future is going to get a good, hard working manager.""
Hartley succeeded John Brown as Dundee manager in February 2014 and guided the club to the Championship title that season.
In the Dens Park club's first season back in the Premiership, Hartley achieved a top-six finish. Last season Dundee narrowly missed out on the top six again and ended the campaign in eighth place.

He took training this morning but was informed on his return to Dens Park that his services were no longer required.
And in a statement, Hartley added: ""I was confident we would have moved up the league table as there are some excellent players in the dressing-room, led by captain Darren O'Dea.
""However, I respect the decision made by the Dundee FC board and would like to wish everyone success in the final five games of the campaign.
""I'm very proud of what I achieved at Dundee since I was appointed manager in February, 2014.
""We won promotion to the SPFL top flight and we finished in the top six. There is no doubt I'm leaving the club in a far stronger position now from when I first joined.""
Dundee won their opening match of this season away to Ross County but then failed to win in their next 10 Premiership games, with seven of those ending in defeat.
They were bottom of the table in October but then recovered and were sixth in February following a 5-1 victory at Motherwell.

"By . Helen Collis . PUBLISHED: . 04:58 EST, 19 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:33 EST, 19 September 2013 . With $12,000 cash in his backpack, an early morning motorbike ride to the jewellers and a big smile on his face, Matthew Camp was off to buy his girlfriend a special engagement ring. But that dream was shattered because unbeknown to him a faulty zip on his bag meant that for miles, his hard earned cash was streaming out behind him. And for fisherman Matthew Camp, the cash truly was the result of hard work, sweat and sacrifices. Good intentions: Matthew Camp planned to buy his girlfriend Tabitha Bohn an engagement ring with his recent paycheck from a good season as a scallop fisherman . After days and even weeks away at sea, aboard the scallop boat the FV Nancy Elizabeth, at last the boat had had a big haul. It was a welcome relief in a job which at times brings in nothing at all. When the ship docked on Sept. 9 in Cape May County, New Jersey, Mr Camp, 32, immediately cashed his check, stuffed the bills into his backpack and headed south on the Garden State Parkway at 8am. According to Philly.com, it wasn't until he reached Lund's Fisheries, close to his home in Lower Township, that the horror of what had happened hit him. Every hard-earned dollar was gone. His plans were ruined; he called his girlfriend Tabitha Bohn. He was 'sick to his stomach' Miss Bohn told Philly.com. 'This season had been good, finally. Last season had been bad and we were at our wits' end. Sometimes he can go out for a month and not even make a paycheck,' she told the news service. Mr Camp only realised all his hard-earned cash was gone after travelling south on his motorbike along the Garden State Parkway to Lund Fisheries . Mr Camp turned his motorbike around and retraced his tracks searching desperately for his money. Some luck, fortunately, was on his side, as a team of highway workers on a roadside project had scooped up $4,000 and handed it in to police. But the rest was gone, presumed taken by opportunist motorists. Mr . Camp, a father-of-four, had received a phone call from a person . claiming to a driver in a silver Dodge pickup, and claiming they had the . cash, Miss Bohn told Philly.com. But the couple weren't sure if it was a cruel prank. No money was handed in to the police. 'It can't possibly feel good to spend someone else's hard-earned money,' she said. His dream was shattered when the $12,000 cash for his scallops, which he stuffed into his backpack, fluttered away in the wind because of a faulty bag zip . As Mr Camp prepared to set off on another long fishing trip, his sister Michelle Godin spoke to the news service, and told them he was angry and embarrassed at what had happened. She stressed he was a hard-working, honest, family man who has to leave his loved ones for days on end for a dangerous job to make ends meet. New Jersey State Police have urged people to contact them with information.

"By . Andrew Levy . 'Blue-eyed angel': Tahlia Raven suffered a rare and fatal reaction to the common childhood bug . Smiling and bright-eyed, little Tahlia Raven looks the picture of health. But shortly after this photo was taken, she died from a common childhood bug normally so benign that it goes completely unnoticed in a third of cases. Just a day earlier Tahlia had been playing outside in the sunshine with her sister Annaliese, five, and there was nothing to suggest she was unwell. The bug, commonly called the slapped cheek virus because of the bright red flush it can trigger on the face, is caught by more than half of children. Tahlia’s rare reaction meant she became only the fourth child to die from the virus in the UK in the past eight years. It was only following a post-mortem examination that the three-year-old was found to have had the bug, also known as  parvovirus. The airborne virus is spread in the same way as cold or flu viruses and is most prevalent in six- to ten-year-olds. After an inquest her grief-stricken mother, Karen Glover, spoke of her heartbreak at losing her ‘beautiful blue-eyed angel’. She said: ‘She was healthy before this. I have been told it is very common in playschools and nurseries and we don’t know why it killed her.’ The inquest in Chelmsford, Essex, heard how Ms Glover found her daughter lifeless in bed on the morning of June 2 last year. Tragic discovery: Tahlia's mother Karen Glover (left) found her daughter lifeless in bed on the morning of June 2 last year, an inquest in Chelmsford, Essex, heard. Right, Tahlia is pictured in a Tinker Bell top at three years old . Sisters: Just a day earlier Tahlia (right) had been playing outside in the sun with her older sister Annaliese (left) The post-mortem examination revealed no evidence of a range of serious conditions, including meningitis or pneumonia. She may have had a minor heart defect, although it was unclear whether this would have affected Tahlia’s ability to fight the infection. Dr Marion Malone, a specialist paediatric pathologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, told the hearing on Monday: ‘I have to consider all possible causes of sudden death in a previously well three-year-old child. Happier times: After the inquest Ms Glover, spoke of her heartbreak at losing her 'beautiful blue-eyed angel' Expert opinion: Dr Marion Malone, a specialist paediatric pathologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital (pictured) in London, said that, on the balance of probability, the toddler died from parvovirus, or 'slapped cheek' bug . ‘The only significant thing I did find was a very swollen brain and some inflammation of the wind pipe. I identified parvovirus from the heart and brain. It is very common in children and known as slapped cheek disease. ‘On the balance of probability, I put down the cause of death as parvovirus. This is very rare. I have not seen a case before which caused such swelling of the brain.’ Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, Essex coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray concluded: ‘Tahlia sadly died at home, a sudden and unexpected death of a little girl who seemed perfectly healthy. She clearly  was much-loved.’ Beloved: Symptoms of slapped cheek virus include a flu-like illness and the distinctive red rash on the face, which can spread to the limbs. Above, Tahlia is pictured with Annaliese (left) and at six months old (right) Ms Glover, from Southend, added the inquest had given her ‘some closure’ as she accepted nothing could have been done to save her daughter. ‘If we had gone to the doctor all they would have given us would be Calpol,’ she said. Symptoms of slapped cheek virus include a flu-like illness and the distinctive red rash on the face, which can spread to the limbs. The only risk group is pregnant women as there is a risk of miscarriage. There is no vaccine, as the virus usually only lasts a few days.","Tahlia Ravens, three, found lifeless in bed by mother on June 2 last year .

"In a throwback to the Cold War, a Russian spy ship caused a stir after unexpectedly docking in Havana on the eve of historic talks between the U.S. and Cuba. There was nothing stealthy about the arrival of the Viktor Leonov CCB-175, which was moored to a pier in Old Havana where cruise ships often dock. But the visit was not officially announced by Cuban authorities. The timing also raised eyebrows as it came on Tuesday, the eve of historic U.S-Cuba talks aimed at normalising diplomatic relations. U.S. officials in Washington played down the presence of the Russian vessel, saying it was perfectly legal and not at all out of the ordinary. 'It's not unprecedented. It's not unusual. It's not alarming,' a defense official told AFP news agency. Scroll down for video . Arriving unnanounced: The Viktor Leonov CCB-175, a Russian Navy intelligence warship, is seen docked to a pier in Old Havana after sailing into the harbour on the eve of historic talks between the U.S. and Cuba . The Vishnya or Meridian-class intelligence ship, which has a crew of around 200, went into service in the Black Sea in 1988 before it was transferred seven years later to the northern fleet, according to Russian media. The vessel previously docked in Havana in February and March last year, staying there for a few days. Those visits were also unannounced. The Russians said the visit was scheduled a long time ago and was yesterday opened up for the children of Russian diplomats. For Cubans, who became increasingly dependent on Russia after the 1959 revolution,  the ship's latest visit has taken them down memory lane. Raphael Hernandez told ABC News: 'We have normal relations with Russia. 'One day, when we have normal relations with U.S., we could have an American ship visiting.' The highest-level U.S. delegation in 35 years will conclude two-day talks in Havana today with both sides cautioning an immediate breakthrough was unlikely. Senior U.S. officials say they hope Cuba will agree to reopen embassies and appoint ambassadors in each other's capitals in coming months. Nothing to see here: U.S. officials in Washington played down the presence of the Russian vessel, saying it was perfectly legal and not at all out of the ordinary . The United States also wants travel curbs on its diplomats lifted and unimpeded shipments to its mission in Havana. During talks on Wednesday, the Americans vowed to continue granting safe haven to Cubans with special protections denied to other nationalities. Cuba complained the U.S. law promotes dangerous illegal immigration and protested against a separate U.S. program that encourages Cuban doctors to defect, calling it a 'reprehensible brain drain practice.' As her deputy sparred with the Cuban officials over immigration policy, the lead U.S. negotiator in the diplomatic talks, Roberta Jacobson, arrived in Havana aboard a commercial charter from Miami. She became the first U.S. assistant secretary of state to travel to the communist-led island in 38 years and the highest-ranking visitor in 35 years. Cuban and U.S. delegations take part in negotiations to restore diplomatic ties in Havana on Wednesday . Her Cuban counterpart will be Josefina Vidal, director of the foreign ministry's U.S. affairs, who also participated in the immigration talks. The meetings are the first since U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced on Dec. 17 they would work to restore diplomatic ties snapped by Washington in 1961. Despite resistance from some in Congress, Obama has set the United States on a path toward removing economic sanctions and a 53-year-old trade embargo against Cuba. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday he looked forward to formally opening a U.S. embassy in Cuba. Kerry also said he was prepared, when the time was right, to meet his Cuban counterpart Bruno Rodriguez, with whom he has only talked by telephone. 'And when it is timely, when it is appropriate, I look forward to traveling to Cuba in order to formally open an embassy and begin to move forward,' Kerry told reporters in Washington. In his annual State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Obama urged Congress to start work on ending the embargo. But critics say Obama first needs to win concessions on Cuban political prisoners and democratic rights, the claims of U.S. citizens whose property was nationalised after Cuba's 1959 revolution, and U.S. fugitives who have received asylum in Cuba. The former Soviet Union was Cuba's main patron during the Cold War.","Viktor Leonov moors up in Old Havana pier during key diplomatic talks .

"A 73-year-old Montreal drama teacher who appeared in some softcore budget films over 40 years ago - one called The Secret Diary of a Nymphomaniac - has been fired from her position at the elite private school after some students traced back her racy roles. Jacqueline Laurent-Auger says she briefly worked as a young erotic actress in Paris - appearing in titles like Swedish Sex Games and Nathalie: Escape From Hell, but nothing pornographic - in the 1970s before returning to her native Quebec. She continued a career in TV and film before settling as a teacher, having taught at the prestigious private school Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf for the last 15 years, according to The National Post. However Laurent-Auger is now out of a job after some male students tracked down some of her work online, presumably by accessing her IMDB page. Scroll down for video . Fired: Drama teacher Jacqueline Laurent-Auger, 73, as fired from private boys school Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf after some students tracked down a set of erotic films she appeared in between 1960 and the 1970s . Controversial: One of the racy titles Laurent-Auger appeared in was Campo de Perversion, which was released in English as Nathalie: Escape From Hell and was set inside a Nazi war camp . Tasteful: In Nathalie: Escape From Hell, Laurent-Auger plays a 'sadistic female SS officer' who tortures an American doctor imprisoned at a Nazi concentration camp . Finale: In this scene, Laurent-Auger's character is shot and killed by the Americans . Sex cinema: Le journal intime d’une nymphomane (The Secret Diary of a Nymphomaniac) and Lorna The Exorcist are some of the titles Laurent-Auger appeared in as a young woman . The school deemed the material - some of which included nude scenes - as unacceptable behavior of a teacher, regardless of when it was filmed. 'The fact these films were made 40 years ago does not change their risqué, suggestive — explicit even — nature,' the school told The National Post. 'Thanks to the Internet, it appears these types of films from the 1970s have come back in fashion. 'As educators, we had to ask what message is transmitted to all our students, boys and girls, from the first year of high school to the fifth, by the fact that the teacher of their drama workshops could now be seen on the Internet in the most suggestive of scenes.' Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf is considered the best school in Quebec. However Laurent-Auger thinks the move is outrageous. She believes, as an elderly woman, the decisions she made in her twenties should not have any great leaning on her life. 'It’s completely absurd,' she told Radio-Canada. 'I’m 73 years old. Elite: Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf is considered the best boys school in Quebec . 'When I made those films I must have been 28 or 29. 'It was to make a living so that after(wards) I could work with great teachers and actors, in Paris and in Quebec. Come on.' 'It is too bad (the principal) said something so stupid, that I was distracting (the students). 'They should have been made to understand what was the cinema of that period.' Laurent-Auger said the films reflect what was happening in cinema at the time and are not considered pornographic but just 'open-minded'. An online petition has been start in order to get Laurent-Auger her job back. There were reports late Wednesday Laurent-Auger had been talking with the school about a new outcome.","Jacqueline Laurent-Auger appeared in some small-time erotic films as a young actress in Paris in the 1960s and 70s .

"MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian reconnaissance aircraft was brought down by a Syrian missile over the Mediterranean early Tuesday, killing all 15 people on board, the Russian defense ministry said. It blamed Israel for the crash, saying the plane was caught in the crossfire as four Israeli fighters attacked targets in northwestern Syria. 
  
 The Russian military said the Il-20 reconnaissance aircraft was hit 35 kilometers (22 miles) off the coast as it was returning to its home base nearby. 
  
 ""The Israeli pilots were using the Russian aircraft as a shield and pushed it into the line of fire of the Syrian defense,"" Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said in a statement. 
  
 Russia said it would make an ""appropriate response"" to Israel. 
  
 The military said Israel did not warn it of its operation over Latakia province until one minute before the strike, which did not give the Russian plane enough time to escape. 
  
 A recovery operation in the Mediterranean Sea is underway, Konashenkov said. 
  
 For several years, Israel and Russia have maintained a special hotline to prevent their air forces from clashing in the skies over Syria. Israeli military officials have previously praised its effectiveness. 
  
 Russia has been a key backer of Syrian President Bashar Assad and it has two military bases in the country, including one close to the Mediterranean coast. 
  
 The Israeli military said earlier on Tuesday that it had no reaction, saying it does not comment on ""foreign reports."" ||||| Syrian air defenses inadvertently shot down a Russian surveillance plane over the eastern Mediterranean Sea, Moscow has said, blaming what it called reckless actions by Israel that led to the deaths of 15 Russian servicemen. 
  
  
  
 The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement on September 18 that Israeli pilots conducting attacks on targets in Syria ""used the Russian plane as a cover, exposing it to fire from Syrian air defenses."" 
  
 ""The blame for the downed Russian plane and the death of the crew lies fully with the Israeli side,"" Shoigu told his Israeli counterpart, Avigdor Lieberman, in a phone call, the ministry said in a statement. 
  
 ""The Russian Defense Ministry, through various channels of coordination, has repeatedly called on the Israeli side to refrain from strikes on Syrian territory that create a threat to the safety of Russian servicemen,"" Shoigu added, according to the statement. 
  
 The Israeli military rejected the accusation, saying Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces were to blame. 
  
 Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, refrained from directly accusing Israel of responsibility for the incident while speaking alongside Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban following their talks in Moscow. 
  
 He said the plane was downed following a ""chain of tragic accidental circumstances."" 
  
 Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said earlier in the day that Moscow could take ""commensurate measures in response"" to ""the irresponsible actions of the Israeli military."" 
  
 Putin said Russia's response would be focused on the security of Russian personnel in Syria. ""These will be steps that everyone notices,"" he said, calling the deaths of the servicemen ""a tragedy for everyone, for the country, for the loved ones of our fallen comrades."" 
  
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed sorrow for the death of the Russian soldiers, his office said in a statement on September 18. 
  
 Netanyahu told Putin during a phone call that Syria bears responsibility for the downing of the jet. 
  
 He also noted that Israel is determined to block Iran from establishing a military presence in Syria and transferring weapons to its proxy Hizballah militia for use against Israel, the statement said. 
  
 State-run Russian news agency RIA Novosti said that the Israeli ambassador to Moscow had been summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry on September 18. 
  
  
  
 The accusation against Israel came hours after the Russian Defense Ministry said that the Ilyushin Il-20 aircraft went off radar 35 kilometers from the Syrian coast at about 11 p.m. local time the previous day. 
  
 The Ilyushin disappeared from radar at around the same time that Israeli F-16 fighters attacked Syrian facilities in Latakia Province, the ministry said.​ 
  
 It said the plane was returning to Hmeimim air base in the northwestern Syrian province of Latakia, where the bulk of Russia's armed forces in the country are stationed. Hmeimim is Russia's main base for air strikes on rebel groups in Syria. 
  
 Fragments of the plane were found 27 kilometers west of the city of Banias, Russian authorities said, adding that some remains of the crew had been recovered as well. 
  
 In Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump said that the Russian warplane was likely shot down by the Syrian regime. 
  
 ""It sounds to me and it seems to me based on a review of the facts that Syria shot down a Russian plane. And I understand about 14 people were killed and that’s a very sad thing but that’s what happens,"" Trump said at a joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda. 
  
  
  
 Earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it was an ""unfortunate"" incident and a reminder that a political resolution to the conflict was needed. 
  
 ""Yesterday's unfortunate incident reminds us of the need to find permanent, peaceful, and political resolutions to the many overlapping conflicts in the region and the danger of tragic miscalculation in Syria's crowded theater of operations,"" Pompeo said in a statement on September 18. 
  
 Russia has given Syrian President Bashar al-Assad crucial support throughout the Syrian conflict, which began with a government crackdown on protesters in March 2011. 
  
  
  
 Several countries are conducting military operations in Syria, in some cases supporting opposite sides in the conflict. Communication lines have been set up between countries to mitigate the risk of unintended military confrontation in Syria. 
  
  
  
 Russia and Israel have largely maintained friendly relations in recent years, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has visited Putin in Moscow several times to discuss the Syria conflict. 
  
  
  
 Israel is not backing a specific side in the Syria conflict, though it has admitted to conducting air strikes in the country targeting Iran and its allies, including Hizballah. 
  
 ""These weapons were meant to attack Israel, and posed an intolerable threat against it,"" it said. 
  
 Before announcing its plane was shot down by Syrian forces, Russia had said rocket launches were detected from the French frigate Auvergne nearby around that time, though the French military denied any involvement. 
  
 Israel claimed that its jets were already inside Israeli air space when Syrian forces launched the missiles that struck the Russian aircraft. 
  
 Konashenkov said the plane was downed by Syria using an S-200 air-defense system that Russia had provided. 
  
 Earlier, the official Syrian news agency SANA reported that missiles were fired at several locations in Latakia Province late on September 17. 
  
  
  
 State media said the explosions were suspected to have been caused by Israeli strikes.

"Saturday's flight was the first movement of material held at the Caithness plant to the US since an announcement in February.
David Cameron, who was prime minister at the time, said the UK and US governments had agreed to an exchange of nuclear materials.
He said the UK would receive a type of uranium used to diagnose cancer.
But Highlands and Islands SNP MSP Maree Todd has criticised the weekend's flight and the level of secrecy surrounding the handling of nuclear material at Dounreay.
She said there should not be a need for an exchange of nuclear material, and the UK should be able to purchase what it requires for medical diagnoses.
Dounreay, near Thurso, is being decommissioned and the site cleaned up.
Most of the radioactive materials held there, such as fuel, are being moved to other locations, including Sellafield in Cumbria where it will be reprocessed or stored.
These shipments are being made by rail.
Other material has been returned to nuclear sites overseas.
During the 1990s, nuclear material was sent from abroad to Dounreay for reprocessing.
The customers included power plants and research centres in Australia, Germany and Belgium.
Under the UK-US deal signed earlier this year, highly-enriched uranium (HEU) stored at Dounreay is being sent to the US.
Saturday's flight took place under tight security from Wick John O'Groats Airport, which is about 30 miles (48km) from the Dounreay nuclear site.
It involved a US military Boeing C-17 transport aircraft.
Radioactive material from the civil nuclear industry has been transported by plane from the UK to other countries in the past.
The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) provided Highlands and Islands Airports Limited with funding to upgrade Wick John O'Groats Airport in preparation for the US flights.
A spokesman for Dounreay said: ""All nuclear materials are being removed from the site. This programme started in 2001 and we expect it to continue for a number of years.
""Our priority at all times is to comply with regulations governing the safe and secure transportation of nuclear material, both in storage and transit.
""Compliance with these regulations includes protecting information about routes, dates, timings and locations of nuclear material in any current or future transport.""
MSP Ms Todd told BBC Radio Scotland: ""I am disappointed we are hearing reports from people living up in Wick that this has happened, but got no official notification.
""I understand that there has to be some secrecy surrounding this industry, but I feel there is more secrecy than is absolutely required.""
She added: ""I understand that this material is weapons-grade in exchange for some medical radionuclides.
""I fail to understand why we cannot pay money for these things than have to supply them with weapons-grade nuclear material from the UK.""",Radioactive material that was being kept at the Scottish nuclear power site Dounreay has been flown to the US.

"London (CNN) -- One of England's biggest soccer stars went on trial Monday, accused of hurling racist abuse at another player during a match last year. The normally staid chambers of Westminster Magistrates' Court in London got an earful of shockingly foul language as lawyers and witnesses detailed what Chelsea captain John Terry said to Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand in the match. A lip reader watching a video of the incident told the court what Terry said, including two extremely obscene words. Terry did not deny directing a barrage of foul language at Ferdinand and referring to him as ""black,"" but he denied engaging in racist abuse. The highly unusual criminal prosecution over words uttered on a soccer field comes as English soccer officials fight to stamp racism out of the sport, with mixed results. Liverpool player Luis Suarez was banned for eight matches when the Football Association, the English sport's governing body, found he had racially abused Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. The chanting of racist abuse by fans also remains a sporadic problem in soccer across Europe. The Crown Prosecution Service is pressing charges against Terry for a ""racially aggravated public order offense"" because of the comments during an October 23 match between Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers. Prosecutors played a video of the incident, without sound, as the case opened Monday morning. The alleged abuse came after Ferdinand knocked Terry down during the game, the jury heard. When he got up, Terry made a gesture as if Ferdinand's breath smelled, and he called Ferdinand a ""c---,"" prosecutor Duncan Penny told the court. Ferdinand responded with the same word, saying it described Terry, not him, because Terry had had sex with a teammate's wife, the prosecutor said. Ferdinand also made an obscene gesture related to sex as Terry ran back into position, Penny said. Ferdinand testified that he did not hear the comments Terry made at him, but that he would have been ""hurt and disappointed"" if he had heard Terry call him a ""black c---"" ""When someone brings your color into it, it takes it to another level and it's very hurtful,"" Ferdinand said. Terry maintains that Ferdinand knocked him down before the incident and that the two then exchanged ""normal football verbals."" He told Football Association officials that he then repeated to Ferdinand words he thought the opposing player had said to him, Penny told the court Monday. The maximum penalty for the offense is Â£2,500 (about $3,900). That would be a drop in the bucket for a player worth millions, but a criminal conviction could lead to action against him by his team or England's Football Association. Terry was captain of England's national team at the time of the incident but was stripped of his captaincy after a preliminary court hearing on the racism charge in February. He remained captain of Chelsea, which went on to win the prestigious Europe-wide Champions League this year. The trial could last up to five days, court officials say.","NEW: A lip reader tells the court what John Terry said, including two extremely obscene words .

"By . Ryan Gorman . PUBLISHED: . 17:48 EST, 16 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:51 EST, 16 September 2013 . A 23-year-old man with Down Syndrome in mixed martial arts (MMA) training for years is now fighting to get into the ring. Garrett Holeve, of Florida, has been denied permission to fight against David Steffan, another disabled fighter. The two men were presented with a cease-and-desist order Aug 2 by the Florida State Boxing Commission just before they were scheduled to step into the ring, according to reports. The fight was organized against Mr Steffan because, having cerebral palsy, he was seen as a fair opponent. Let him fight: Garrett Holeve (pictured) has amputee fighter Nick Newell in his corner . Though state boxing commissions do not . typically regulate amateur MMA fights, they stepped in to stop the fight . between the two disabled men on grounds it was unsanctioned, according . to Headline News. Despite training non-stop for two months and having the backing of promoters, Mitch Holeve, Garrett Holeve’s father, fears the fight might never happen. ‘It's our belief, based on conversation with people within the MMA community, that getting it done in any state isn't going to be easy,’ the father told HLN. Mitch Holeve further explained that he feels his son not being allowed into the ring is a public relations move by the sport. ‘There is a core group of people involved in MMA that are trying to protect the sport from bad PR,’ Mitch Holeve told the network. ""They feel having disabled people compete would give the sport a 'black eye.' They are also afraid of the 'sideshow' effect.’ A conspiracy: Mitch Holeve, the 23-year-old aspiring fighter's father, feels his son isn't being allowed into the ring because insiders want to protect the sport's image - a sentiment with which a promoter who spoke to MailOnline agreed . A prominent New York-based promoter echoed Mitch Holeve's concerns in comments to MailOnline. ‘This . is all image, if somebody gets hurt on your show… I don’t see the . upside to doing that,’ a New York-based fight promoter said. ‘If somebody gets hurt, then you’re the guy who put [a disabled person] in the ring,’ the promoter added. There is a wide gulf between the people in favour of G-Money – as Garrett Holeve is known in the ring – fighting, and those against it. ‘One respected athletic inspector said that allowing Garrett Holeve to fight in an MMA bout was exploitative, no matter if the audience cheered and gave Holeve a standing ovation after the fight,’ Zach Arnold, editor of MMA website Fight Opinion told HLN. ‘The concept of allowing someone with… limited cognitive ability and brain issues to take punches and get slammed drew a swiftly negative reaction amongst the people I interviewed,’ Arnold added. It's his dream: All Mr Holeve wants to do is get in the ring, in a fair fight - he's not gunning for the UFC . Nick Newell, famous for going undefeated in his first 10 professional MMA fights as an amputee, has trained with Holeve – and feels he’s getting a raw deal. ‘I think we should give him a chance,’ Mr Newell told MailOnline. ‘Everyone deserves an equal chance.’ Explaining that he’s also trained with Mr Steffan, Mr Newell – who goes by ‘Notorious’ in the ring, said that both men are equal competitors. ‘I think that’s a good fair fight, the kid’s not asking to fight in the UFC,’ said Mr Newell, adding that ‘he just wants a small-time, amateur fight.’ Explaining that ‘it’s not a street fight,’ and that there are referees and medics, Mr Newell said ‘it’s safety first... it's not like he's even going to be on TV.' Notorious: Mr Newell has won his first 10 pro fights and is a champion, he doesn't feel it's fair to keep Mr Holeve out of the ring . Mr Newell said that he noticed no physical limitations with Garrett Holeve when he trained and that it will not matter if he wins or loses, he just wants to get into the ring. 'People said the same things about me… and look at me, I’m 10-0 and a world champion,' the undefeated fighter said. For now, according to HLN, the two fighters are looking to fight in Nebraska – and Mr Newell is all for it. ‘If the kid’s training hard and chasing his dream, who’s anyone to say he can’t… it’s not fair.’","Garrett Holeve, 23, was set to fight David Steffan, an opponent with cerebral palsy .

"PENSACOLA, Fla. — Anyone listening to Rush Limbaugh’s radio show Tuesday could be forgiven for thinking that Judge Roger Vinson has the federal government dead in his sights. 
  
 Mr. Limbaugh spent some time profiling Judge Vinson, a senior judge on the Federal District Court in Pensacola, who had just announced he would allow a legal challenge to the new health care law to advance to a full hearing. The conservative radio host informed his listeners that the judge was an avid hunter and amateur taxidermist who once killed three brown bears and mounted their heads over his courtroom door to “instill the fear of God into the accused.” 
  
 “This,” Mr. Limbaugh said, “would not be good news” for liberal supporters of the health law. 
  
 But, in fact, Judge Vinson has never shot anything other than a water moccasin (last Saturday, at his weekend cabin), is not a taxidermist and, as president of the American Camellia Society, is far more familiar with Camellia reticulata than with Ursus arctos.

 Apparently, Mr. Limbaugh had fallen prey to an Internet hoax. 
  
 On Sunday night, and again Monday morning, someone identified only as “Pensacolian” edited Judge Vinson’s Wikipedia entry to include the invented material. The prankster footnoted the entry to a supposed story in The Pensacola News Journal. The article — like its stated publication date of June 31, 2003 — does not exist. The same person who posted the information removed it on Tuesday afternoon, Wikipedia logs show.

 As calls flooded in about Mr. Limbaugh’s depiction, Judge Vinson, 70, took it all in stride. “I’ve never killed a bear,” he said Wednesday, “and I’m not Davy Crockett.”

 His wife, Ellen, was less amused. “It offended me,” she said, “because I don’t think you should be able to broadcast something nationally if you can’t verify it.” ||||| No matter what Rush Limbaugh says, Senior U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson has never killed any bears, and he isn't a taxidermist on the side. 
  
 Actually, he's a flower guy, camellias in particular. 
  
 On his radio program Tuesday, Limbaugh said Vinson, the Pensacola judge presiding over a legal challenge to President Barack Obama's health care reform, was an ""avid hunter"" who once had severed bear heads mounted in the court room to intimidate defendants. ... ||||| ""Everybody in the world knows you don't believe anything on Wikipedia,"" Rush Limbaugh told his listeners last year. So, uh, it must be embarrassing for him that he just used Wikipedia as a source—and got his facts wrong. 
  
 On Tuesday, Limbaugh told his listeners about Judge Roger Vinson, of the Federal District Court in Pensacola, Florida, is presiding over a legal challenge to the country's new health-care reform law. Here's a transcript, quoting liberally from Vinson's Wikipedia article: 
  
 Who is this judge? Judge Clyde Roger Vinson is a Ronald Reagan appointee. Judge Clyde Roger Vinson is an avid hunter. He's an amateur taxidermist. Do you know what a taxidermist is? That's right. For our liberal caller today, this would not be good news. A taxidermist stuffs dead game. If you go into a big, all-male club, you'll see some moose head over the fireplace. A taxidermist is responsible for it. ""After a 2002 hunting trip during which he killed three brown bears, Vinson had their heads mounted over the door through which defendants must pass to enter the courtroom. At the time Vinson said the sight of the severed bear heads would ‘instill the fear of God' into the accused. The heads were removed in June 2003,"" it didn't even take a year (laughing) ""following complaints by local defendants' rights groups."" 
  
 What a scary, conservative-sounding judge! Too bad none of that is true. Judge Vinson is not much of a hunter (""I've never killed a bear, and I'm not Davy Crockett,"" he said in a statement). In fact, his main hobby is horticulture: He's the president of the American Camellia Society. As his wife Ellen asked The New York Times, rhetorically: ""Can you imagine the president of the American Camellia Society having three stuffed bears in the courthouse?"" (No, we cannot, but we also are having trouble imagining the president of the American Camellia Society, period.) 
  
 When Limbaugh was called out over the incorrect information, a spokesman insisted that the story had come from an article in The Pensacola News Journal. Only, the News Journal says no such article ever existed. The only reference to such an article online? The footnotes to Judge Vinson's Wikipedia page, which list the article as having appeared on June 31, 2003. (June 31, in case you need a reminder, is not an actual date.) 
  
 Well, we've all been there, right? Probably, Limbaugh just didn't know not to believe everything he reads on Wikipedia. Oh, wait. He did know! In fact, he was ranting about it last October, after a series of racist quotes was misattributed to him on Wikipedia sister site Wikiquote: 
  
 I mean, everybody in the world knows you don't believe anything on Wikipedia because anybody can go in there and put anything on that they want to unless you succeed in getting your site locked, and I don't even care about that. Wikipedia is as irresponsible as anything else. Anybody can post anything they want on there. But these are the professionals! They're supposed to check this stuff. 
  
 You're exactly right, Rush! Broadcast professionals are totally supposed to check on this stuff. What's that you say? People who don't fact-check are ""literal professional scum""? 
  
 Whatever happened to journalists calling people and saying, ""Did you actually say this? I'm doing a story on blah, blah, blah. Did you actually say this?"" They didn't want to take the chance I didn't say it. They wanted the excuse to run the fabricated quote. They wanted the opportunity to do it. These people are scum. They are literal professional scum and they are responsible in many ways for the deteriorating standards and quality of journalism. They are leading the pack. They are found on both the news side and the sports side, and they are doing everything they can to promote disunity and discord throughout our culture and society while holding themselves up in their own minds as great unifiers and people who care only about social justice. When they're basically just incompetent, irresponsible, impersonators of journalism. 
  
 ""Incompetent, irresponsible, impersonators of journalism."" Yeah, that sounds about right.

Limbaugh, speaking Tuesday about the judge who is presiding over a challenge to the president's health care reform, called him an ""avid hunter"" who intimidated defendants by mounting bear heads around his courtroom. But ""I've never killed a bear, and I'm not Davy Crockett,"" says Judge Roger Vinson—in fact, he's actually more interested in the camellia flower—and Limbaugh appears to have gotten the story from Wikipedia. Making the story even better, Gawker notes, is the fact that Limbaugh himself was once the target of a similar hoax, in which racist quotes that he never actually said were attributed to him on sister site Wikiquote. One of his reps tells the New York Times Limbaugh got the information about the judge from the Pensacola News Journal, but that paper says it never published any such thing. Wikipedia, however, referred to such a story, supposedly written on June 31, 2003, a date that doesn't even exist. (The reference has since been removed.) For more fun Limbaugh stories, click here."
"(The Frisky) -- It seems that all anyone is talking about lately is the economy, so why is money still such a tough topic to discuss with your nearest and dearest? They say married couples fight over money more than anything else, but what about when you just started dating? That's possibly even more awkward. Columnist says no woman should leave her house on first date without enough money to pay for her meal. The first date . Though Dr. Phil feels otherwise, my take on this has always been he (or she) who asks, pays. (The bloviating shrink says men should always be the ones to pony up.) And if you don't pay for the whole thing, you should at least offer to split the tab. Incredibly (to me), most women I spoke to thought I was an idiot and firmly believed the dude should always pay on a first date -- though for some this was a recent change of heart. Kate, a 33-year-old writer told me, ""I tend to try to pay for myself, but as I get older and more comfortable with my awesomeness, I kind of wish and hope that the other person will be a little more old-fashioned about it."" Good point. If someone's eating opposite Amazing Me, shouldn't she or he pay for the privilege? After all, I'm entertaining and cute and if you let me order dessert there may be some smooching in your future. Regardless of your feelings on the matter, whatever you do, don't leave the house without enough money to pay for at least your share. It's a first date so while he may seem great (and generous) on paper, you never really know what you're getting into until he's sitting across from you. Sure, he might be staring adoringly deep into your eyes, but then again, his pants might be held up with duct tape. Do you really want to count on that dude to know the meaning of ""gratuity?"" What to say: ""That's so generous of you -- can I at least leave the tip?"" What not to say: ""This princess doesn't pay for food!"" Dates two-thru-six . Jennifer Kelton, CEO and founder of BadOnlineDates.com, has built a business on bad dating behavior. She explains her thoughts on the money issue: ""While it's not expected, Let's face it -- we are hardwired to want the man to 'bring back dinner to the cave.'"" Up until my current relationship, I've almost always been in the driver's seat finance-wise (and believe me, that's a pretty meager seat) so I've always furnished my own cave. I ask her if it's okay to date a guy just for a free ride or free grub? Kelton says no. ""Being cheap is never attractive and I would say that after more than four dates the woman should pay the tip."" Whoa! Just the tip? Apparently the women who called me a moron were onto something! However, if you're going to keep riding the free-food express, the least you can do is surreptitiously feel out his money situation -- if he's hurting, suggest cheaper restaurants or maybe cook for the guy. What to say: ""That's so generous of you -- can I at least leave the tip?"" What not to say: ""Let's have the 2000 Perrier-Jouet, since this one's on you!"" Dates six-thru-infinity . Up until the two of you really get to know each other, there's probably not going to be any urgent need to discuss finances in depth, but he can't keep buying you steak and foie gras dinners if he's on a cheeseburger and fries budget. For all you know, you're out-earning him or he's supporting 12 Guatemalan orphans and is stretched to the breaking point. Then again, maybe he's a gazillionaire. At about date six (possibly sooner if they're really eventful dates!), you should be getting to know a lot about every part of him -- including his wallet. There's no right or wrong way to approach this discussion, but just remember, financial compatibility is almost as important as sexual chemistry, though rarely as much fun.

"Fiona Barnes, who also faked terminal cancer, was jailed for 15 months for the theft from Preston's Space Centre and perverting the course of justice.
The 55-year-old was ordered to pay back £1 at a Proceeds of Crime hearing at the city's crown court after she was found to have ""no money to her name"".
The centre said the ruling was ""outrageous"" and a ""complete insult"".
Barnes, of Brigend, Dunblane, stole £24,713 from the Space Centre in 2012.
She tried to cover her tracks by faking documents indicating the centre had won non-existent grants of up to £800,000 and was jailed in September 2016.
Speaking after the hearing, Jane Robinson, deputy manager of the Space Centre, said: ""It is a complete insult. I'd rather she didn't pay anything than she pays £1.
""After what she did, it just seems outrageous. She nearly ruined us.""
The centre was bought out by charitable company Creative Support, based in Manchester, which has secured its future.

"Washington (CNN) Russia appointed actor Steven Seagal as a ""special representative"" on US-Russian humanitarian ties, the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in statement on its official Facebook page Saturday. 
  
 According to the statement , the action star's role will be to promote US-Russia relations ""in the humanitarian sphere,"" adding that the role will include collaboration ""in the sphere of culture, public and youth exchanges."" 
  
 The foreign ministry said the unpaid role will be similar to the United Nations' goodwill ambassador positions. 
  
 Seagal, who became a Russian citizen in 2016, is a close friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He attended Putin's recent swearing-in ceremony in May. 
  
 Seagal has been an ardent supporter of Putin, going so far as to defend his government against allegations of election meddling in the United States. He told Piers Morgan on the British ITV network's ""Good Morning Britain"" last year, ""For anyone to think that Vladimir Putin had anything to do with fixing the elections, or even that the Russians have that kind of technology, is stupid."" 
  
 ""And this kind of propaganda is really a diversion ... so that the people in the United States of America won't really see what's happening, "" he added. 
  
 In the interview, Seagal also praised Putin as ""a great world leader"" and a ""brilliant tactician."" 
  
 In 2013, BuzzFeed reported that Putin suggested to President Barack Obama that Seagal serve as an honorary envoy of Russia to help improve relations between the two countries. Also that year, California Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher credited Seagal with facilitating meetings for a congressional delegation that visited Russia in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings to investigate the suspects' backgrounds and discuss intelligence sharing issues.

Мы выразили удовлетворение темпами роста товарооборота, договорились работать над тем, чтобы его структура становилась более сбалансированной. Этим вопросам будет посвящено заседание Межправительственной комиссии по торгово-экономическому и научно-техническому сотрудничеству, которое планируется в первой половине этого года здесь, в Тунисе. Мы также напомнили нашим тунисским коллегам о том, что в прошлом году Российская Федерация предложила подписать программу торгово-экономического и научно-технического сотрудничества между нашими странами на 2019-2021 годы. Мы попросили, и Премьер-Министр Туниса Ю.Шахед обещал это сделать, ускорить согласование этой программы, чтобы она могла быть одобрена на предстоящем заседании Межправительственной комиссии. Также договорились ускорить ратификацию подписанного ранее межправительственного соглашения о сотрудничестве в сфере мирного использования ядерной энергии и подписание целого ряда других проектов и документов, которые касаются облегчения визового режима, автомобильного транспорта и сотрудничества в сфере охраны окружающей среды. Тунисские коллеги также проинформировали нас о планах развития инфраструктуры своей страны. Они заинтересованы в том, чтобы российские компании, прежде всего занимающиеся строительством автомобильных и железных дорог, участвовали в соответствующих тендерах. Будем поощрять наших экономических операторов откликаться на такие предложения. С удовлетворением отметили развитие сотрудничества между Тунисом и российскими регионами, в частности между Тунисом и Татарстаном. Президент Татарстана Р.Н.Минниханов посетил эту страну в октябре прошлого года. Состоялся бизнес-форум с участием бизнесменов Туниса и Татарстана. Такие контакты мы также будем всячески поощрять.

"For Jack and Nancy Gatewood, not even death could separate them. A tale of true love, the pair, both 88, met as high school students in Ash Grove, Missouri. They soon became sweethearts and were married for 68 years, until recently when they died less than 16 hours apart in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Mrs Gatewood, who was a homemaker, had been in hospital dealing with complications related to a broken hip, pneumonia and flu before passing away around 5.30pm on January 15. A tale of true love, the pair, both 88, met as high school students in Ash Grove, Missouri (pictured in front of their family home's special oak door) Mr and Mrs Gatewood were highschool sweethearts and married for 68 years, until recently when they died less than 16 hours apart in Tulsa, Oklahoma (pictured on their 50th anniversary) Mr Gatewood, older by seven months, was heartbroken after spending three weeks away from his wife while she was in hospital - the first time they spent an extended time apart since the Second World War - and died without ever learning of his companion's passing, according to Tulsa World. Before his family could tell him of the news of his devoted wife, Mr Gatewood, a retired insurance worker, died around 8.30am on January 16 as a result of cardiac arrest. However, his family believes he suffered from a broken heart. 'I think he was missing her and didn't know where she was,' said son Jack Gatewood II, a pastor in Keller, Texas. He added: 'We believe it was a broken heart. I know that's old-fashioned to say, that it doesn't hold up medically. But she had been gone from his life, and we believe he was grieving for her.' As the time apart was difficult for Mr Gatewood, his family said people at his care home would find him wandering and asking where his wife was while she was in hospital. The couple married in April 1946 upon Mr Gatewood's return from serving in the Navy and then relocated to Oklahoma where they lived for 47 years (pictured on their wedding day) Suffering from dementia, he was unable to remember when they told him. And when she passed away, Jack II was on his way to see his father, who died before he reached him. The last time Mr and Mrs Gatewood were together was in December. Jack II said: 'The last time we saw them together they were kissing and holding hands. We were not expecting them to pass.' The couple married in April 1946 upon Mr Gatewood's return from serving in the Navy and then relocated to Oklahoma where they lived for 47 years. Originally from Three Sands, Oklahoma, Mr Gatewood was living in nearby Everton, Missouri, at the time, when he and his soon to be sweetheart were joined together. He transferred to her high school in Ash Grove following the burning down of his school. The pair began dating their junior year of high school and remained dating throughout Mr Gatewood's two years of serving in the Navy. After they exchanged vows, the couple lived in their midtown home where they raised sons Jack II, Brad, Todd and Marc. They are survived by their sons, four grandchildren and three great-grand children. The reason they were able to stay married for so long was because of their devotion and commitment to each other, said Jack II. He said: 'They were very committed to marriage. They loved each other a lot, they were both faithful and they depended on each other.' As they enjoyed traveling and visits with friends, their favorite time together was spent with family. By standing at the front door to their home, it was even evident family was important with the special door made of oak and that had symbols to mark each of their children. Serving as a model for a successful marriage, their sons said the pair were in sync in everything they did and it was not until later in life that they ever saw their parents argue. Jack II said it was a blessing his parents were able to depart together. Bonded together by love for nearly 69 years of marriage, Jack and Nancy Gatewood of Tulsa, Oklahoma entered into eternal life separately, less than 16 hours apart. Nancy passed away Jan. 15, followed by her husband Jack the next morning on Jan. 16. Jack Gatewood was born in Three Sands, Oklahoma on February 28, 1926. Nancy Gatewood was born in Ash Grove, Missouri on Sept. 26 also in 1926. Having met during high school in Ash Grove, MO Jack and Nancy were married in 1946 upon Jack’s return from service with the U.S. Navy during WWII. After marrying, they moved to Tulsa, OK residing here until their deaths this week. Nancy was a devoted wife and homemaker while Jack built a career in life insurance, working 43 years for Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. until his retirement in 2005. The major focus of their lives was making a home for their four sons and enjoying extended family. They were long time members of Memorial Baptist Church in Tulsa. Jack was a Life Member of the Million Dollar Round Table and served on numerous Tulsa boards. He was also active in the Rotary Club of Southside Tulsa. Nancy was a member of the American Sewing Guild and used her gifted creativity in numerous ways but especially in designing her own clothing. Their favorite times together were spent with family, friends, and traveling. Jack and Nancy are survived by four sons: Jack Gatewood and wife Janie of Keller, Texas; Brad Gatewood and Todd Gatewood both of Tulsa; and Marc Gatewood and wife Alecia of Cape Coral, FL. They also leave four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Source: Ninde .","Jack and Nancy Gatewood were residents of Tulsa, Oklahoma for 47 years .

 “The agent was aware her son had a substance-abuse problem. Our agent has assured us she had absolutely no prior knowledge of her son's alleged manufacture of meth within the subject property.

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| When Chris and Jenny Nugent bought their dream home in Indiana, they made sure to get the house inspected for mold and damaged pipes. 
  
 But they never imagined they would also need to have the house tested for meth contamination. 
  
 The Nugents said they used their life savings to take out a mortgage on the $144,000 cheery-looking home nestled on an acre of land in the quiet suburbs, enough room for them, their two young daughters and infant son. But after they moved in, they said everyone in the house started feeling ill. 
  
 “They were sick every week,” Jenny Nugent said. “They would wake up. Throw up. Have digestive issues and then by noon, 1 o’clock start to feel better.” 
  
 ABC News 
  
 The Nugents said their daughters were missing school, the baby wasn't sleeping through the night, and even the family dog became ill and had to be put down. Jenny Nugent also said she noticed strange metallic smells around the house, especially in the kitchen. 
  
 “It smelled like a handful of change,” she said. 
  
 Jenny Nugent said a neighbor finally cracked the mystery, telling her she suspected the previous owner had cooked meth in the house. Nugent immediately got her home tested -- a simple procedure that costs $50. 
  
 “I am so grateful that we were fortunate enough to have really good neighbors,"" she said. ""If it were not for them, we may have not known until one of our kids ended up in the hospital.” 
  
 After two tests, the results were horrifying. The Nugents said the downstairs floor had methamphetamine levels nearly 18 times higher than what’s considered legally safe, including the room where baby Mason had been sleeping for 10 months. 
  
 The family immediately moved out and eventually ending up in an apartment, but they said they felt forced to throw away most of their belongings for fear of contamination. 
  
 “Those test results came back, I remember that night we just pulled up in the driveway and were like, ‘we’re never going back in there other than to get our clothes,’ and we haven’t,” Chris Nugent said. 
  
 For Jenny, returning to the house is painful. She says she feels like she can’t even go inside without wearing protective gear. 
  
 “It feels like a death happened, to be honest,” she said. “That’s how it feels to my husband and I.” 
  
 When methamphetamine is smoked or cooked inside a home, invisible molecules of the drug sink into the carpet, walls and everywhere else, experts said. The meth residue is then inhaled or ingested, even absorbed through the skin. Exposure can cause symptoms like headaches, nausea and vomiting, according to the National Institute of Health. 
  
 To be able to re-sell the house and recoup their savings, the Nugents had to hire a professional cleaning team, Crisis Cleaning, who handle meth decontamination, something most home insurance doesn't cover. 
  
 “That’s something that’s happening even more than what I've ever seen before since I started doing this the last five years,” said Crisis Cleaning’s Donetta Held. 
  
 To decontaminate the Nugents house, the Crisis Cleaners cut out all the carpets, gave the house a professional vacuuming and then gassed it with a mix of potent chemicals that the cleaners say neutralize the meth particles. One pass-through is often not enough, sometimes they must de-contaminate a room several times. All in, the cost to clean the Nugents' home is expected to be about $10,000. 
  
 Crisis Cleaning says they offered to clean the Nugents' home pro-bono. 
  
 While this is a frightening scenario, the Nugents are not alone. Indiana was ranked number one in the nation in meth lab seizures last year, beating out Tennessee and Missouri, according to statistics that the Missouri State Highway Patrol complied from the U.S. Department of Justice’s National Clandestine Laboratory Seizure Report. Indiana State Police’s Meth Suppression Section said they conduct as many as four meth busts a day across the state. 
  
 “It’s an ongoing battle,” said Trooper Nate Raney. “Everything that we do is to try to stay one step ahead of them.” 
  
 To combat the meth house problem, the Indiana state police created an online registry that lists thousands of homes where meth or meth labs have been found, although they estimate that for every meth house they locate, two more are undiscovered. “We really don’t know how many meth labs are out there,” said Meth Suppression Section Commander Niki Crawford. “The problem is, when you find one that’s been thrown in a ditch somewhere, that meth lab was somewhere. Was it in a car? Was it in a hotel room? Was it in an apartment? Was it in a house? We don’t know.” 
  
 The best way to prevent a nightmare like the Nugent family's is to have a simple home meth test done on the house before you sign. 
  
 “Just do the meth test,” Jenny Nugent said. “It’s $50. It will give you peace of mind. ... That’s the best recommendation I could make to anybody.” 
  
 The Nugents are now suing the real estate agent, the real estate company, Carpenter Realtors, and the former owners of the house for breach of contract, claiming the agent who sold them the house, Lori Argue, knew meth was being used on the premises because the former owner is her son, Joshua Argue. 
  
 When contacted by ABC News, the attorney for Lori Argue and her company said, “There is simply no evidence that Lori Argue or any representative of Carpenter had any knowledge of methamphetamine use or contamination on the real estate,” adding that the buyers had an independent home inspection prior to purchasing the home. Read the full statement from Lori Argue's attorney HERE 
  
 Joshua Argue declined ABC News' request for comment, but his ex-wife Jelisa Argue told ABC News in a statement, “There was no meth being used or cooked in the house when I lived there; I’ve never used meth and I would never put my son or anyone else in that environment.” 
  
 She added that after she and her son moved out, her ex-husband remained in the house for almost two years. Read her full statement HERE. 
  
 “It causes a lot of anger. There are some days that are harder than others,” Jenny Nugent said. “I think what helps us get through a lot of the anger is the fact that we've had a lot of support from our friends and family.” |||||","– Those buying homes in the US have learned over the years to check for things like mold and radon. As a couple in Indiana learned, it might be wise to add meth to the list, reports ABC News. Chris and Jenny Nugent bought a $144,000 house in suburban Indianapolis and couldn't figure out why their two daughters and infant son kept getting sick, nor could they find the source of the strange odor (""like a handful of change"") in the house. After a neighbor voiced suspicions about the previous owner, the Nugents had their home tested for methamphetamine levels—and learned they were off the charts. They had apparently bought a former meth lab in the 'burbs, and the toxic residue was sickening them. “You’ve seen the 'Faces of Meth,' what happens to a person who takes the chemicals inside of their bodies and see how it is deteriorating the body itself,"" the owner of an Indiana cleaning company tells AlJazeera America. ""It’s doing the same thing to the home. It’s making the home very sick with toxic chemicals on the walls, on the carpet, and through the ventilation systems."" Cleanup is expensive—the Florida Times-Union cites an example of a ""golf community"" home in St. Johns County in which the bill hit $40,000—but test kits can be picked up for $50 or so.

"In the typical textbook picture, volcanoes, such as those that are forming the Hawaiian islands, erupt when magma gushes out as narrow jets from deep inside Earth. But that picture is wrong, according to a new study from researchers at Caltech and the University of Miami in Florida. 
  
 New seismology data are now confirming that such narrow jets don't actually exist, says Don Anderson, the Eleanor and John R. McMillian Professor of Geophysics, Emeritus, at Caltech. In fact, he adds, basic physics doesn't support the presence of these jets, called mantle plumes, and the new results corroborate those fundamental ideas. 
  
 ""Mantle plumes have never had a sound physical or logical basis,"" Anderson says. ""They are akin to Rudyard Kipling's 'Just So Stories' about how giraffes got their long necks."" 
  
 Anderson and James Natland, a professor emeritus of marine geology and geophysics at the University of Miami, describe their analysis online in the September 8 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
  
 According to current mantle-plume theory, Anderson explains, heat from Earth's core somehow generates narrow jets of hot magma that gush through the mantle and to the surface. The jets act as pipes that transfer heat from the core, and how exactly they're created isn't clear, he says. But they have been assumed to exist, originating near where the Earth's core meets the mantle, almost 3,000 kilometers underground—nearly halfway to the planet's center. The jets are theorized to be no more than about 300 kilometers wide, and when they reach the surface, they produce hot spots. 
  
 While the top of the mantle is a sort of fluid sludge, the uppermost layer is rigid rock, broken up into plates that float on the magma-bearing layers. Magma from the mantle beneath the plates bursts through the plate to create volcanoes. As the plates drift across the hot spots, a chain of volcanoes forms—such as the island chains of Hawaii and Samoa. 
  
 ""Much of solid-Earth science for the past 20 years—and large amounts of money—have been spent looking for elusive narrow mantle plumes that wind their way upward through the mantle,"" Anderson says. 
  
 To look for the hypothetical plumes, researchers analyze global seismic activity. Everything from big quakes to tiny tremors sends seismic waves echoing through Earth's interior. The type of material that the waves pass through influences the properties of those waves, such as their speeds. By measuring those waves using hundreds of seismic stations installed on the surface, near places such as Hawaii, Iceland, and Yellowstone National Park, researchers can deduce whether there are narrow mantle plumes or whether volcanoes are simply created from magma that's absorbed in the sponge-like shallower mantle. 
  
 No one has been able to detect the predicted narrow plumes, although the evidence has not been conclusive. The jets could have simply been too thin to be seen, Anderson says. Very broad features beneath the surface have been interpreted as plumes or super-plumes, but, still, they're far too wide to be considered narrow jets. 
  
 But now, thanks in part to more seismic stations spaced closer together and improved theory, analysis of the planet's seismology is good enough to confirm that there are no narrow mantle plumes, Anderson and Natland say. Instead, data reveal that there are large, slow, upward-moving chunks of mantle a thousand kilometers wide. 
  
 In the mantle-plume theory, Anderson explains, the heat that is transferred upward via jets is balanced by the slower downward motion of cooled, broad, uniform chunks of mantle. The behavior is similar to that of a lava lamp, in which blobs of wax are heated from below and then rise before cooling and falling. But a fundamental problem with this picture is that lava lamps require electricity, he says, and that is an outside energy source that an isolated planet like Earth does not have. 
  
 The new measurements suggest that what is really happening is just the opposite: Instead of narrow jets, there are broad upwellings, which are balanced by narrow channels of sinking material called slabs. What is driving this motion is not heat from the core, but cooling at Earth's surface. In fact, Anderson says, the behavior is the regular mantle convection first proposed more than a century ago by Lord Kelvin. When material in the planet's crust cools, it sinks, displacing material deeper in the mantle and forcing it upward. 
  
 ""What's new is incredibly simple: upwellings in the mantle are thousands of kilometers across,"" Anderson says. The formation of volcanoes then follows from plate tectonics—the theory of how Earth's plates move and behave. Magma, which is less dense than the surrounding mantle, rises until it reaches the bottom of the plates or fissures that run through them. Stresses in the plates, cracks, and other tectonic forces can squeeze the magma out, like how water is squeezed out of a sponge. That magma then erupts out of the surface as volcanoes. The magma comes from within the upper 200 kilometers of the mantle and not thousands of kilometers deep, as the mantle-plume theory suggests. 
  
 ""This is a simple demonstration that volcanoes are the result of normal broad-scale convection and plate tectonics,"" Anderson says. He calls this theory ""top-down tectonics,"" based on Kelvin's initial principles of mantle convection. In this picture, the engine behind Earth's interior processes is not heat from the core but cooling at the planet's surface. This cooling and plate tectonics drives mantle convection, the cooling of the core, and Earth's magnetic field. Volcanoes and cracks in the plate are simply side effects. 
  
 The results also have an important consequence for rock compositions—notably the ratios of certain isotopes, Natland says. According to the mantle-plume idea, the measured compositions derive from the mixing of material from reservoirs separated by thousands of kilometers in the upper and lower mantle. But if there are no mantle plumes, then all of that mixing must have happened within the upwellings and nearby mantle in Earth's top 1,000 kilometers. 
  
 The paper is titled ""Mantle updrafts and mechanisms of oceanic volcanism."" ||||| At school, we were all taught that volcanoes—just like the one rumbling away in Iceland—erupt when narrow jets of magma are forced outwards from the core of the Earth. It's a compelling enough story that it's appeared in textbooks for decades—but it's also, apparently, completely wrong. 
  
 So, the theory we all know and love goes that these long, thin columns of magma—referred to by those in the know as mantle plumes—act a bit like pipes. There's a well of liquid rock close to the core of the Earth and, though we don't quite know how when they formed, these narrow outlets that are 2,000 miles long and less than 200 miles across allow it to vent out to just below the Earth's crust, in the mantle. Where those columns sit in the mantle there are hot spots—and when the Earth's stiff crust fractures slightly, the magma can burst up and out as a volcano. 
  
 The problem is that such long, thin columns of magma aren't easily explained by basic physics. ""Mantle plumes have never had a sound physical or logical basis,"" explains Don Anderson, Professor of Geophysics at Caltech. ""They are akin to Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories about how giraffes got their long necks.""

 That may sound harsh, but he has evidence to back his point: despite scientists holding that the current volcano theory is accurate, seismological searches for the plumes—the only way to look that deeply into the planet—have yielded no trace of them. 
  
 But Anderson has a new theory, which he's just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Based on the latest seismological analysis of the planet's structure, Anderson and his team have discovered that the plumes are far bigger than anyone ever considered in the past; in fact, there are huge chunks of hot mantle rising at any one point, which are thousands of miles across.

 Imagine a lava lamp inside the planet, with wax replaced by molten rock, and you're not far off. When the hot stuff gets to the top, some of it cools and then falls in long, narrow channels. So, in essence, the new theory is kind of the reverse of the old one. 
  
 In terms of volcanoes on the surface, the new theory means that their magma actually comes from much closer to the surface of our planet, at the top of Earth's mantle, rather than jetting up from closer to the center of the Earth. Interestingly, that means that volcanic eruptions aren't fueled by excess heat from the core, but rather how the magma close to the surface cools over time. 
  
 Of course, that doesn't make eruptions any less damaging when they happen—but it does mean that we can rewrite the textbooks. [PNAS via Caltech via PhysOrg] 
  
 Image by Pablo Hidalgo/Shutterstock |||||","– Textbooks have long offered students an explanation of volcanoes that's totally wrong—or so say scientists who are offering a very different theory, Caltech reports. The standard explanation depends on the existence of long, narrow columns or jets of magma known as mantle plumes. Since about 1990, they've been largely accepted among geologists, Caltech professor Don Anderson tells the Huffington Post. The thinking was that molten rock near the Earth's core shot up to the planet's mantle in these plumes, believed to be less than 186 miles wide. Gizmodo explains what was thought to happen next: ""Where those columns sit in the mantle, there are hot spots—and when the Earth’s stiff crust fractures slightly, the magma can burst up and out as a volcano."" Thing is, those mantle plumes just don't exist, the experts say; indeed, the plumes have ""never had a sound physical or logical basis,"" says Anderson. ""They are akin to Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories about how giraffes got their long necks."" So what's really happening? According to Anderson's team, the new data indicates that there aren't narrow columns at all, but slow-moving ""upwellings"" that can be thousands of miles across. And instead of heat from the planet's core causing the motion, cooling at the surface is responsible for the movement: The cooling causes chunks of mantle to sink, and the less-dense magma is displaced and pushed upward. Thanks to cracks and stresses in the Earth's plates, the magma can be squeezed out of the Earth like a sponge. (Click to read about another unusual volcanic discovery.)"

"International investigators were more cautious, however, saying only there were ""very strong"" indications this was the case.
The plane disappeared between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing in March 2014 with 239 people on board - this is the first trace of it found.
What are the chances this find will solve one of the biggest aviation mysteries ever?
It appears to bolster the theory that the plane crashed into a patch of the Indian Ocean west of Australia after it diverted from its route.
Australian authorities including Prime Minister Tony Abbott said that the search would continue in the 60,000-sq-km area near Perth.
""It is heartening that the discovery of the flaperon is consistent with our search area and we will continue to search this area thoroughly in the expectation we will find the missing aircraft,"" said the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is leading the operation.
Reunion is roughly 6,000km (3,700 miles) west of the search area.
Australia's national science agency CSIRO has computer simulations of the debris path showing the pieces would have initially stayed at the latitude of the search site, before winds and currents - known as the Indian Ocean gyre - pushed them in a north-west arc.
On where the debris could have ended up, CSIRO oceanographer David Griffin says: ""Madagascar was probably the highest probability, and Reunion is not far from that in the scheme of things.""
Others have noted that a boat lost off the Western Australian coast last year was found nearly intact eight months later, west of Madagascar.
Investigators have been examining the 2m-long (6ft) piece in Toulouse, France this week after it was found on a beach in Reunion on 29 July.
They have based their belief that the plane part could very possibly be from MH370 on two sources.
One is Boeing which has confirmed that the piece, called a flaperon, belongs to a 777 plane - the same model as MH370.
The other is Malaysia Airlines which has provided documentation on MH370's aircraft.
But investigators have stopped short of providing full confirmation, saying they can only do this after further tests on the fragment.
French prosecutor Serge Mackowiak, who has presented investigators' is exercising supreme legal caution, says the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris.
It could also be months before they make any tentative deductions about how the plane may have come down.
One key question is whether the plane part's serial number is intact, which French investigators have not mentioned.
Aeroplane parts, including flaperons, usually come with details such as a serial number, its manufacturer, and safety certification. These can be traced back to the manufacturer, who in turn would check its database to see which plane the part was used in.
Investigators say that Boeing identified the part based only on ""technical characteristics"" such as the colour and the structure of its joints.
There is no shortage of aircraft debris floating in the oceans so French investigators need to be absolutely certain this flaperon is not from another plane.
Several aeroplanes have crashed in the Indian Ocean or in the vicinity of Reunion in the past two decades, although none were Boeing 777s.
Two crashes involved large aircraft which ended up in waters near the Comoros Islands. One is Yemenia Airways IY626 - an Airbus 310 - which crashed in 2009.
The other is Ethopian Airlines ET961 - a Boeing 767 - that crashed in 1996.
Greg Waldron, of Flightglobal, said what is really needed are the plane's flight recorders - one piece alone won't solve the mystery, he told the BBC.
Others say it is difficult to use the piece to pinpoint the exact location of where the plane is. ""You can't trace the flight path with enough certainty based on this,"" said David Griffin from CSIRO.
Marine salvage expert David Mearns agreed with this assessment. He told the BBC that even if the debris was from MH370, the ""uncertainty is too great"" to find the crash site given that the plane disappeared 16 months ago.
""I have backtracked wreckage to locate shipwrecks but only over a drift period of one to three days,"" he said.
Robin Beaman, a marine geologist with Australia's James Cook University, said the pictures showed substantial marine growth - gooseneck or stalked barnacles - on the debris. These are commonly found on flotsam in the Indian Ocean, he told the BBC, and only on objects floating on the surface.
Mr Beaman said it was obvious from the barnacle growth that the part had been drifting for ""quite a long time"".
But he said it was hard to say how long exactly - it could be years or months - and that it was also unclear how long the part had been onshore before it was found.
The announcement has been met with mixed reactions by relatives.
Sarah Bajc whose partner Philip Wood was on MH370, told the BBC: ""Perhaps families will finally have the chance to grieve now, though this doesn't solve the mystery or hold anyone accountable. Both of those things still have to happen.""
She added that there was still ""much outstanding mistrust"" of the authorities. ""It hurts to have to give up that last thread of hope, but there is also a sad relief,"" she said.
Some say the finding does not necessarily mean the plane crashed into the sea.
Lee Khim Fatt, whose wife Foong Wai Yueng was on MH370, told the BBC: ""I'm not convinced by the finding. I want to see an item that I can recognise.

And when the revered drama returns with the second half of season 5 (beginning Aug. 11 on AMC), what should we brace for? Among other things, maybe a bit of self-reflection from the cancer-stricken chemistry teacher who transformed himself into a lethal drug kingpin with the help of high school dropout/partner Jesse (Aaron Paul). ""We often said in the writers' room that if Walt had a superpower, it would be not his chemistry knowledge or his ability to cook crystal meth but his ability to lie,"" series creator/executive producer Vince Gilligan tells EW. ""Walt has been the world's greatest liar, and I think the person he lies most capably to is himself. So in these final eight episodes, perhaps the lies will cease to find traction and the scales will start to fall away from Walt's eyes. And when that happens, will Walt really begin to realize who he is? That's a question that we asked ourselves a lot in the writers' room this year."" Of course, Walt won't have too much time for navel-gazing, as he'll need to keep his eyes on his brother-in-law Hank — in addition to other adversaries. ""There will be antagonistic relationships aplenty,"" promises Gilligan, adding: ""Walt's got plenty of fight left in him. And he's got plenty of forces to fight. You met some of them. Others you haven't."" Should viewers brace for a high body count? ""As the movie title goes, there will be blood,"" answers Gilligan. ""To my mind, that's not the most interesting thing. It's the emotional moments and the character moments. ... We've got some stuff that I think is going to be truly satisfying and truly shocking and jarring. It does not always center on moments of violence."" And these moments will come flying at you at ""breakneck speed,"" he warns: ""I have surprised myself at how much story there was left to tell and how quickly we tell it. You need to really settle down on the couch and pay close attention because it's going to come at you fast and furious in the final eight episodes."" Gilligan is both cautious and upbeat when it comes to discussing that highly anticipated finale. ""We worked long and hard to ensure that these final eight — and, in fact, the very last episode — would satisfy an audience,"" he says. ""I am guardedly optimistic that we have achieved just that. And furthermore, trying to be as coy as possible, trying to give away as little as possible, I feel like this ending represents on some level, however small, something of a victory for Walter White. Read into that what you will. And try to be as open-minded as possible when you watch this episode, because it may not indeed feel like a victory. Or maybe it will. ... I feel good about where it all ended up, and I can't wait for people to see it."" Asked for one last cryptic hint about the homestretch of episodes, Gilligan says: ""Sometimes you see meth labs in the darndest places."" See the original story at EW.com.

"Today, fossil fuel power stations are usually built with towers that emit vapour as well as greenhouse gases into the air.
Special Report: The Technology of Business
Make-It-Yourself: The rise of the micro-manufacturers
Could high-end camping gear save lives around the world?
Could renting Fido make you rich?
The maps transforming how we interact with the world
Is 'mind control' now a reality?
But what if a new kind of power station could create electricity without belching harmful gases into the air?
Despite the development of renewable technologies, fossil fuels are still used to generate the overwhelming majority of the world's power, and it is likely they will continue to do so for many years.
In the US, about 70% of the country's electricity comes from burning fossil fuels. Other major economies, such as China, are even more dependent.
But now Net Power, based in the US state of North Carolina, believes it can redesign the power plant so it can still run on coal or natural gas, but without releasing harmful fumes.
Rodney Allam, chief technologist at 8 Rivers Capital, which owns Net Power, says: ""The perception has been that to avoid emissions of [carbon dioxide] CO2, we have to get rid of fossil fuels.
""But unfortunately, fossil fuels represent over 70% of the fuel that's consumed in the world and the idea that you can get rid of that in any meaningful sense is a pipe dream.""
The Net Power system is different from currently operating power plants because carbon dioxide, normally produced as waste when making electricity, would become a key ingredient when burning the fuel.
A brief history of climate change
Carbon dioxide would be put into the Net Power combustor at a very high temperature and pressure along with the fuel, such as natural gas or coal, and oxygen.
Using the carbon dioxide as a so-called working fluid - used to make the turbine function - it would pass through the system in a loop, to be recycled and used again.
Mr Allam says: ""I've developed a system where we can actually make use of the impurity itself to try and assist the removal of that impurity from the power system.""
In addition, Net Power believes its technology would be cheaper to operate than current power stations.
Mr Allam says: ""It was my ambition to create a cycle which would be cheaper - or at least as cheap - as existing technology without CO2 capture, and yet go for 100% CO2 capture.""
The system is geared to enable a process called carbon capture and storage (CCS), which would see the excess carbon dioxide from the fuel combustion funnelled into a pipeline or a tanker instead of being released into the air.
Mr Allam says that because the whole cycle happens at a high pressure of about 320 atmospheres, the gas emerges with a pressure and level of purity that is ""capture ready"" - or ideal for storage.
This is different from the carbon dioxide produced by other kinds of power plants, which is mixed with gases such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide.
Separating the carbon dioxide is hard, so it is difficult to apply the process to existing coal-fired power stations.
'Buying time'
Experts agree that although CCS models could be effective, they are still new and need to be proven to work well.

""It would be a good idea to try out the technology and see whether it works, and what it costs,"" says Prof Dieter Helm at Oxford University.
Meanwhile, Dustin Benton, head of resource stewardship at the Green Alliance, says there is ""huge promise"" for CCS in the UK.
But he adds: ""CCS doesn't solve the emissions problems for the power sector. But if it's cost-effective, it will buy time and help us decarbonise rapidly.
""We don't know what it will cost yet - the promise of CCS mustn't distract us from developing renewables as well.""
Net Power says it is planning to build a small power plant that would demonstrate the technology works. They hope to begin construction within the next 12 months.
Their technology has arrived at a moment when the UK is trying to promote low carbon technologies.
The UK's energy sector is in urgent need of investment, but does not have many new projects in place, says Prof Helm.
He adds that by 2015-16 the UK power sector is likely to be under a lot of pressure, as a government programme requiring some power plants to close comes into effect.
The government has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% from 1990 levels by 2050.
""There is going to have to be fairly wholesale changes to power as well as transport infrastructure in the UK if we want to meet those targets,"" says Prof Martin Williams, at King's College's Environmental Research Group.
Mr Benton says this makes the UK a good place to explore the implementation of CCS.
""The UK has a unique combination of [research and development] and offshore engineering expertise, strong, science-led carbon budgets, and an industrial and commercial base that wants CCS to happen,"" he says.
There is still the question of what to do with the carbon dioxide, once it has been captured and stored.
""You can put it straight into a pipeline and deliver it to be disposed of - usually geologically,"" Mr Allam says. ""You put it underground somewhere.""
But carbon dioxide pipelines have not been built in the UK yet.
Another option would see the gas put on a ship and taken to the North Sea to be used for a process called enhanced oil recovery, where the gas is pumped deep underground into oil fields where most of the oil has already been extracted.
Because of the way carbon dioxide swells when it mixes with oil, it can be used to push the oil out of places that are hard to reach, getting more out of an existing basin.
But oil emissions are difficult to capture so some researchers say enhanced oil recovery could pose its own environmental challenges.
Mr Benton explains: ""CCS might help in the transition to a low-carbon economy, but not if it doesn't reduce emissions overall.""",Could the smoke stack of a power station soon be a thing of the past?
"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 13:31 EST, 6 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:16 EST, 7 November 2012 . A former detective who helped catch the Yorkshire Ripper has tonight made the shocking claim that Jimmy Savile was quizzed over the serial murderer's crimes. Former West Yorkshire detective John Stainthorpe told ITV Yorkshire Calendar News that Savile was brought in for questioning after members of the public contacted the police naming the eccentric DJ as a possible killer. Mr Stainthorpe, who worked for the West Yorkshire force for more than 40 years, and who spent years trying to catch Peter Sutcliffe, told the programme: 'When the Ripper was really active one of the suspects put forward by members of the public was Jimmy Savile, strange as it may seem. Scroll down for video . Savile, seen at Broadmoor in 1991, as Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe meets boxer Frank Bruno, who was on a visit to open a new gym . John Stainthorpe said a member of the public named Savile as a suspect . 'Obviously it was not him, but he was interviewed along with many others, as you can appreciate.' Today, however, a West Yorkshire Police spokesman . said: 'Hundreds of people were identified in the operation, we cannot be . more specific than that at this time. 'Details of all who were questioned . in connection with the crimes are in storage, so we cannot confirm that . Jimmy Savile was spoken to.' Mr Stainthorpe said the person who gave police the anonymous tip-off was 'aiming in the right direction'. 'Child perverts soon become child killers,' he added. The detective's shocking revelation comes as the killer claimed today that Savile regularly visited him in custody and the pair became friends. Rubbishing claims the late DJ abused . around 300 victims over six decades, Sutcliffe said those making allegations . were 'jumping on the bandwagon'. The Yorkshire Ripper's horrific crimes shocked the nation as he embarked on a  murderous rampage across the country, slashing his victims, mutilating them and killing them. Between 1975 and 1980, the vicious murderer attacked women, stabbed his victims with screwdrivers, stamped on them, left notes with their bodies taunting police for not catching him and killed in total 13 women. Officers desperate to catch him cast their net far and wide as they hunted for the man who signed his notes as 'Jack The Ripper' and launched a huge campaign, publishing his notes and voice recordings in a bid to have someone identify the murderer by his writing or voice. In 1981 he was convicted of  murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others. Sutcliffe, 66, who will never be released from Broadmoor mental hospital, told the Sun that the claims made against his 'friend' Savile were just exaggerations. Jimmy Savile, shown relaxing at his penthouse flat in Roundhay, Leeds, in 2006, lived just yards from where Sutcliffe killed his third victim . A victim of Savile has demanded police instigate any links between him and the Yorkshire Ripper . Peter Sutcliffe has defended Savile . He said: 'It's a load of rubbish. People are just getting carried away. 'He visited a lot. He'd always come and chat with me on visits and I would introduce him to my visitors. Several times he left £500 for charities I was supporting.' One of Savile’s abuse victims urged police to investigate any links between the pair, The Sun reported. The victim told the newspaper: 'Sutcliffe and Savile are two peas in a pod. 'It's quite fitting the only person to stick up for Savile is Sutcliffe.' Sutcliffe's 'friend' Savile was said to have been given his own set of gold-plated keys to high-security Broadmoor mental hospital, where Sutcliffe is a patient. He was allegedly given bedrooms or an office at . three hospitals, and yesterday more former patients came forward to say . he abused them on children’s wards. The details come after it was reported that Sutcliffe killed his third victim, . Irene Richardson, mere yards from Savile’s flat in Roundhay, Leeds, in . 1977. Miss Richardson was killed near the disgraced paedophile's three-bedroom penthouse, which overlooks Roundhay Park. It is three miles outside Leeds city . centre, with floor to ceiling windows, and has been put on the market . for £325,000, with the proceeds intended for the Jimmy Savile Charitable . Trust. Savile's relatives said they do not . want a penny of his £4.3million estate and called for the cash to be . donated to an organisation to tackle sex crimes. Mental hospital: A gold-plated set of keys to Broadmoor was presented to the predatory paedophile as a reward for his volunteering, and gave him access to mentally ill patients, it was claimed . At . Broadmoor, Savile boasted that he was actually responsible for getting . some mentally ill patients - among them murderers - freed from their . sentences. He called himself the ‘Governor’ of the . hospital and was made chairman of a hospital taskforce by the Department . of Health in the 1980s. Savile, who died a year ago aged 84 in his Leeds flat, is now believed by police to be one of the UK's most prolific child abusers. Scotland Yard is leading a national investigation into the television and radio star's activities. Detectives are following 400 lines of inquiry while the BBC has launched an inquiry into the culture and practices at the corporation in the era of Savile's alleged sexual abuse. Savile was allegedly questioned by police about the crimes of Peter Sutcliffe. Seen here are twelve of his 13 victims . Police are pictured searching the grounds of a property where the body of Marguerite Walls, the 12th victim of Peter Sutcliffe, was discovered. A detective claims the disgraced DJ was quizzed by police in connection with the terrible deaths . Police and forensic experts, seen examining the place where another victim was killed by the Yorkshire Ripper, spoke to hundreds in their hunt for the killer . The police launched a huge campaign to track down the killer who hurt so many women, and were given Savile's name by a member of the public during the inquiry . Last month health chiefs announced an inquiry into Jimmy Savile’s reign of abuse at three NHS hospitals. It will be run by the Department of Health itself, raising fears it cannot be truly independent. Former barrister Kate Lampard will oversee the investigation to provide ‘independent oversight’, Downing Street pledged. It will examine why the paedophile presenter was allegedly given the keys to Broadmoor mental hospital, a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville and free rein at Leeds General Infirmary. He allegedly raped and molested young victims for decades without anyone stopping him. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘[Kate Lampard] will provide oversight of the Stoke Mandeville, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor inquiries as well as the Department of Health’s inquiries into the appointment and role Savile held at Broadmoor Hospital. ‘All relevant information from these inquiries will be passed to the police.’ Unlike the BBC, which has issued several grovelling apologies, none of the hospitals has yet said sorry for the alleged abuse. Savile, who raised £40million for the hospital in his lifetime, boasted that he ‘lived’ in a bedroom managers had given him at Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire, and said he could do as he pleased.","Member of the public named Savile as a 'potential Ripper suspect'

"(CNN) -- ""The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure: A Child-Lover's Code of Conduct"" was pulled from Amazon.com, a spokesman confirmed Thursday, after thousands of users posted angry comments and threats to boycott the site. The self-published e-book was available on the site for download until late Wednesday for $4.79. Company spokesman Drew Herdener would not comment on the controversy or respond to questions about the company's guidelines for digital publication. On Wednesday, Amazon defended selling the book in response to a report published on BusinessInsider.com. ""Amazon believes it is censorship not to sell certain books simply because we or others believe their message is objectionable. Amazon does not support or promote hatred or criminal acts, however, we do support the right of every individual to make their own purchasing decisions."" Before it disappeared from the site Wednesday night, the listing had more than 2,000 user comments. The vast majority of them condemned the book's stated content, as well as Amazon's decision to make it available. ""It is ILLEGAL to molest children, and for Amazon to promote such is insane. I'm an abuse survivor, and am OUTRAGED Amazon would choose to promote this nonsense. I will not be purchasing anything from your website until this is removed,"" one user wrote in a comment that summed up the feelings of many others. In its product description, the book's author described it as ""my attempt to make pedophile situations safer for those juveniles that find themselves involved in them, by establishing certian [sic] rules for these adults to follow."" ""I hope to achieve this by appealing to the better nature of pedosexuals, with hope that their doing so will result in less hatred and perhaps liter [sic] sentences should they ever be caught,"" he said. Author Phillip R. Greaves II told CNN that he published ""The Pedophile's Guide"" to address what he considers unfair portrayals of pedophiles in the media. ""True pedophiles love children and would never hurt them,"" the Pueblo, Colorado, man said in a phone interview Wednesday night. Greaves, 47, told CNN that he has not had sexual contact with a child as an adult, but did when he was a teenager. He also said he ""was introduced to oral sex when I was 7"" by an older female, but did not provide specifics. A small contingent of Amazon.com users defended the author's right to free speech, and a discussion on the site titled ""Why Amazon is Right"" delved into the constitutional implications of the controversy. Others floated the possibility that the e-book was a hoax or a law enforcement trap for pedophiles. ""While I think 99.9 percent of us object to pedophilia (even though I think this particular book was a publicity stunt/joke), I think we can all agree that we don't want someone else censoring a subject matter that we may be interested in. Religion, atheism, homosexuality, etc. are some subjects that spring to mind ... and they have been censored in the past until we realized that it's best to let all information in (even if we don't like some of it), rather than allow some authority or individual decide what we can and can't know about based on their own opinions or motivations,"" one user wrote.

"(CNN) -- A Kentucky census worker who was found dead in September committed suicide and staged the scene to look like a homicide, authorities said Tuesday. The body of William E. Sparkman Jr., 51, was found September 12 near a cemetery in southeastern Kentucky's Clay County. He was wearing only socks. ""A thorough examination of evidence from the scene, to include DNA testing, as well as examination of his vehicle and his residence, resulted in the determination that Mr. Sparkman, alone, handled the key pieces of evidence with no indications of any other persons involved,"" Kentucky State Police said. Sparkman's wrists were bound with duct tape, and a rope around his neck was tied to a tree, but his body was touching the ground, authorities said. He had ""Fed"" written on his chest in black ink. However, Sparkman's wrists were loosely bound in front of his body at shoulder width apart, allowing for ""considerable mobility,"" said Kentucky State Police Capt. Lisa Rudzinski. He was also in contact with the ground, ""almost on his knees,"" she said. ""To survive, all Mr. Sparkman had to do was stand up."" Lividity on the body -- marks made as blood stops pumping and settles in areas of the body -- showed that Sparkman died in the same position, Rudzinski said. His glasses were taped to his head, and that tape was underneath tape that held a rag in his mouth, she said. ""Mr. Sparkman had extremely poor eyesight"" and so would have needed his glasses secured, Rudzinski said. But the most compelling evidence came from the fact that Sparkman had obtained $600,000 in accidental-death insurance, which would not have paid in the event of a suicide, as late as May, she said. In addition, he told a ""credible witness"" of his plans to commit suicide and stage the scene to make it look like he was slain because he worked for the federal government. The details were consistent with how Sparkman died and was found, Rudzinski said. The witness did not take action after Sparkman shared his plans out of a belief that he would not follow through, authorities said. ""It was learned that Mr. Sparkman had discussed recent federal investigations and the perceived negative attitudes toward federal entities by some residents of Clay County,"" Kentucky state police said in a statement. Police believe that Sparkman's primary motive in staging the scene was to ensure that the insurance would be paid, Rudzinski said. His motive for committing suicide or any secondary motives might never be known, she said, as Sparkman left no note. ""We don't know what Mr. Sparkman was thinking or why he ultimately committed this act,"" she said. Autopsy results showed no evidence of any cancer or terminal illness, officials said, although it was reported that Sparkman had previously had lymphoma. Police would not say who the beneficiary of the insurance was. Forensic analysis of the writing on Sparkman's chest showed that he had written it himself, Rudzinski said. Analysts found ink dots, made by writers on completing a letter, at the top of the letters, rather than at the bottom -- as would be expected if someone had made the writing on Sparkman. Despite a search by authorities, the black felt pen used for the writing has not been found. Police do not believe that anyone assisted Sparkman, she said. Sparkman had told the witness, whom police declined to name, that he intended to dispose of some of his personal effects, including his laptop computer and other items. Police have not found those items, Rudzinski said. Toxicology tests showed that Sparkman was not drugged or under the influence of any substance, she said. The red rag removed from his mouth was similar to those found in his pocket and at the scene. DNA testing of the rags and the rope used in creating a ligature on Sparkman's neck, as well as 7 feet of discarded rope discarded near his body, found only Sparkman's DNA, she said. The police investigation is still open, and additional test results are expected in the next two to three weeks, authorities said. Authorities met with Sparkman's son and told him of their findings before publicly releasing them. ""Our hearts go out to him,"" Rudzinski said. ""He still lost his father at the end of the day."" She would not say whether his son accepted the findings, saying she did not want to speak for the family.","Census worker staged scene to ensure insurance policy would be paid, police say .

"(CNN) -- American Airlines has already called Alec Baldwin ""extremely rude,"" and now the actor isn't making any friends at Greyhound either. Baldwin was booted off an American Airlines flight Tuesday because he refused to turn off his cell phone after the plane's doors were closed for departure, the airline said. The actor was apparently playing ""Words With Friends,"" a Scrabble-like online game. In a column published by The Huffington Post on Wednesday, Baldwin said a crew member singled him out during the incident. He also raged against flight attendants who ""have made flying a Greyhound bus experience."" That didn't sit well with Greyhound. In an open letter to the actor issued Thursday, Greyhound President and CEO Dave Leach said he was disheartened to hear about the comments Baldwin made about the company. ""I'm the first to admit that Greyhound has had some challenges in the past, so I understand that you probably were basing your comments on that alone. But we've made so many changes in recent years to significantly improve the travel experience,"" Leach writes. ""My guess is you've never traveled with us, but I ask you to give us a try for a number of reasons and see for yourself that we're really a great way to travel."" Leach then touts the hundreds of new buses the company has added to its fleet as well as the extra legroom, leather seats, power outlets and free Wi-Fi. ""I think you especially would find the latter two amenities exciting, because we don't require our customers to turn off their electronic devices ... ever. You could therefore play 'Words With Friends' during your entire trip and nobody would give you any grief over it,"" Leach tells Baldwin in the letter. He also reminds the actor that Greyhound carries more than 17 million travelers a year and asks Baldwin to become one of them. ""I invite you to meet with me in New York and we'll take a trip to Boston so you can see first-hand what a great ride Greyhound can be,"" Leach writes. ""We are not the same company we used to be. We are better, providing a safe, affordable and modern travel alternative to other forms of transportation.

"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (CNN) -- On the outskirts of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in the dusty crowded neighborhood of Akaki, I've just been treated to a traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony. The beans are roasted and the coffee boiled in front of you then served piping hot with a heaping spoonful of sugar and a side of freshly popped corn. As I step out onto the dirt road to leave, one of my hosts wants to ask a question: do I know anyone who can donate some wheelchairs, so adults don't' have to carry disabled children on their backs to school anymore? I wish I did. The woman who needs the wheelchairs is one of the 20,000 volunteers for Yekokeb Berhan, a USAID-funded program trying to help half a million highly vulnerable children. The name means ""Light from the Stars"" in Amharic, and is meant to reflect the resiliency of children. After spending a week working with the volunteers here, I have no doubt those wheelchairs are going to find their way, due to the resiliency of the adults. Read more: Ethiopia's rock churches 'built by angels' Yekokeb Berhan volunteers are chosen by community committees and given training in health, parenting, budgeting and life skills. Then they go out into communities, to find and identify the most vulnerable children. Each volunteer will take in 25 of those kids as her own. ""I have 29 children"" says Sintayehu Kenna, a mother of four (plus 25), ""I can't separate them from my own. I love them. "" The program's philosophy is that the way to help children is to help their families. More often than not, assistance is needed in multiple areas -- and that means these volunteers have had to become master networkers -- calling on friends, family, neighbors, local businessmen and faith leaders to get the kids what they need. Leyela Ayele, from the Kolfe neighborhood, tells me about a family of eight in which the father was sick and the mother was the breadwinner until she had a heart attack and died. Ayele volunteered to foster the six kids. One of the boys was malnourished and Ayele went to every health center in the area, telling doctors about him, until she found one to admit and treat him. She visited the local bakery and convinced the owner to provide breakfasts for another child. And she linked up the eldest with a government association that gave a scholarship to study hairdressing. Volunteers receive a stipend of about $10 a month to cover phone and transportation costs. They are expected to give about 15-20 hours a week, but I found they all are giving much, much more. Alemitu Yemes has 31 kids, four of her own, two foster kids plus her 25 kids from the program. She's given a small room in her compound, rent free, to a family of five. Everyone except the youngest toddler is HIV positive. Yemes is working to keep the kids in school and making sure the family keeps to their anti-viral medical regime. ""We don't want them to be dependent,"" she says, ""I'm telling them to be self-reliant and we are all working towards that together."" Yekokeb Berhan is also working in conjunction with local government and 40 civil society organizations to recruit, train and supervise the volunteers all over the country. In Ethiopia, formal education doesn't begin until age seven. So, the Hiwot Integrated Development Association (HIDA) struck a deal with the local government. HIDA would renovate and supply an early childhood development center if the government would pay the teachers. That partnership resulted in new brightly colored classroom expanded to serve 128 children, many of them considered highly vulnerable. Amharic and English are taught, and on the day I visited, I was treated to a version of the nursery rhyme Mary Had a Little Lamb. But the backbone of the Yekokeb Berhan program is the individual volunteers. A majority of the women I met were single mothers with big families of their own. Some work as bread makers and vegetable sellers, but about half of those I spoke with seemed to have no other support. But yet everyone I met said it was their moral obligation to help others. ""Even after they turn 18 years we will still help them, by linking them up with the woreda (local government) and getting them skill training and jobs. We will empower our graduated children,"" says Gete Tefera, who has two children of her own, plus her 25 fosters. Read more: War orphans turn tragedy into triumph . On my last day in Addis, I met with a group of women entrepreneurs in a half-built concrete mid-rise with broken windows, which will one day be a youth center. Through Yekokeb Berhan's ""Community Self-Help Savings Group"" each is getting help with a new venture and for the first time in their lives, saving money. The women enthusiastically describe their plans: one is switching from selling bananas to housewares, because the latter doesn't spoil; another is expanding her business from selling used clothes to new. But the profits will not be all theirs. As part of the program, two birr a week, about 10 cents, has got to go into a kitty to help out those in need. Before I leave, one woman says there are a lot of kids in the neighborhood unable to go to school because of poor eyesight. She wants to know if I know anyone who can get them the glasses they need. I don't. But I'm going to look into it. Find out more about Yekokeb Berhan.","Ethiopian group is helping highly vulnerable children .

One man was killed and 77 injured after police in Papua New Guinea opened fire on rioting asylum seekers in an Australian-run detention camp last night. Thirteen people suffered serious injuries, two of which has been flown to Australia for treatment, after the the second riot this week at a detention centre on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Australian officials says the riot began when detainees forced their way out of the centre, but refugee advocates insist it was sparked when local residents and police stormed the facility. Scroll down for video . Deadly uproar: One person was killed and 77 injured during a second night of rioting at an Australian immigration detention centre on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island . Australian Immigration Minister Scott Morrison described the violence as the latest in a series of protests at the camp, which houses around 1,300 men from countries including Afghanistan, Sudan's Darfur region, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Pakistan, Somalia, and Syria. 'This is a tragedy, but this was a very dangerous situation where people decided to protest in a very violent way and to take themselves outside the center and place themselves at great risk,' he told reporters. He said one man died from head injuries as he was taken to the hospital. He would not disclose the victim's nationality, or say how he had sustained the injuries. Another person was shot and was flown to the Papua New Guinea capital Port Moresby while one man was flown to Australia for treatment of a fractured skull, he said. In all, 77 people received medical treatment including 13 who were seriously injured, he said. Criticised: UN agencies and human rights organisations have called for the camps to be closed down due to the living conditions for the refugees . Tension: The camp, pictured in July last year, houses around 1,300 men from countries including Afghanistan, Sudan's Darfur region, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Pakistan, Somalia, and Syria . Morrison initially said the injuries had occurred outside the camp but later said he was uncertain whether the fatal injuries had been inflicted within the camp or outside, adding that local authorities are investigating the matter. Mr Morrison said Papua New Guinea police opened fire after detainees pushed down the perimeter fence and spilled into the street around the camp. However, an Australian advocacy group said inmates claim  to have been attacked by police and local residents. Defense: Australian Immigration Minister Scott Morrison says the riot began when detainees forced their way out of the centre . Gangs of police and locals — armed with machetes, pipes, sticks and stones — had roamed from compound to compound within the camp attacking asylum seekers, Refugee Action Coalition said. This was denied by Australian officials and security firm G4S, who operates the camp. The violence followed a less serious brawl at the same facility on Sunday night that led to the arrests of eight asylum seekers and another 19 being treated for injuries.

"(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund moved a big step closer to a first German Bundesliga title in nine years on Saturday with a historic 3-1 victory over defending champions Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena. Jurgen Klopp's team moved 13 points clear of second-placed Bayer Leverkusen, who visit Werder Bremen on Sunday, and 16 ahead of Bayern -- who lost at home to Dortmund for the first time in 20 years. Louis van Gaal's team dropped to fourth after the home defeat, occupying Germany's final Champions League position for next season with 10 rounds to play. Paraguay striker Lucas Barrios opened the scoring in the ninth minute with his 11th goal of the season after Bayern midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger lost posesssion to Kevin Grosskreutz, who threaded a perfect pass into the penalty area. Welcome win for struggling Wolfsburg . Brazilian defender Luis Gustavo equalized seven minutes later with his first goal for Bayern since arriving from Hoffenheim in January, sidefooting in a volley from Franck Ribery's corner. Dortmund immediately went back in front through a wonderful effort from Turkey midfielder Nuri Sahin, who curled a 20-yard left-foot shot past goalkeeper Thomas Kraft. Bundesliga top scorer Mario Gomez thought he had leveled again in the 20th minute, but the striker was ruled to be offside. Former Bayern defender Mats Hummels sealed the Westphalian team's victory with a header from Mario Gotze's corner on the hour mark. With 15 minutes left, Dortmund's 22-year-old Australian keeper Mitchell Langerak capped a solid Bundesliga debut when he denied Germany international Gomez from close range. Hanover claimed third place after central defender Christian Schulz's last-gasp header was enough to see off St. Pauli. The 27-year-old converted from Portuguese winger Sergio Pinto's 87th-minute corner to put Mirko Slomka's team two points ahead of Bayern,. Mainz remained in fifth place after also needing a late goal to snatch all three points away to Hoffenheim. Former Austria midfielder Andreas Ivanschitz put the visitors in front before his compatriot David Alaba looked to have rescued a draw for ninth-placed Hoffenheim in the 84th minute. But with just four minutes left, 30-year-old Colombian midfielder Elkin Soto secured victory for Thomas Tuchel's Mainz with his second league goal of the season. Germany international Lukas Podolski scored an 88th-minute winner to help Cologne beat SC Freiburg and climb into 11th position, eight points behind their opponents. Sixth-placed Hamburg could only manage a 1-1 draw away to relegation-threatened Kaiserslautern. Marco Kurz's Kaiserslautern drew first blood through Adam Hlousek's first-half goal, but Marcell Jansen's leveler for Armin Veh's Hamburg left the home team in 15th position and above the relegation play-off place on goal difference. Schalke's disappointing Bundesliga season continued with a 1-1 draw at home to Nuremberg. Nuremberg, currently eighth in the table, took the lead through Jens Hegeler, only for former Real Madrid and Spain striker Raul to equalize after 52 minutes.","Borussia Dortmund record first win away to Bayern Munich since 1991 .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insists his players have to step up in the absence of captain Steven Gerrard after a frustrating goalless draw at home to Sunderland. With a must-win match at home to Basle in the Champions League on Tuesday, followed by a trip to Old Trafford, the 34-year-old midfielder was left on the bench until 23 minutes from the end.

His talent is world-class but that contribution has to come around the team,' he said. 'It can't be up to him every single game to be the catalyst. 'It is very hard to replace that quality but going forward that is something of course we will need. 'He was excellent when he came on and of course he plays on Tuesday. 'He still has that talent, he has world-class ability and it is me looking to manage that. 'We have a big month. Until the new year there are big games and the management of Steven is fine, there is no problem with that.' Rodgers (right) decision to rest his captain was in light of Liverpool's crucial Champions League tie at home to Basle on Tuesday .

Only Aston Villa and Burnley have scored fewer goals at home than Liverpool's seven and Rodgers' decision to leave Fabio Borini out of the squad - meaning he had no striker on the bench - was questioned. The Italian enjoyed a good loan spell at Sunderland last season and almost joined them in the summer after Liverpool agreed a deal to sell him. 'That is a decision I make as a manager,' said Rodgers when asked about the forward's absence.

'I would love to,' he said before attempting to address the collapse of the transfer. 'It is difficult to explain. It was a long summer and the things everyone knows, we agreed a price and we flew to America (for Liverpool's pre-season tour) and he didn't come. 'The bottom line is he is not with us. I am trying to concentrate on what we have got.' What they had was good enough to keep their hosts at bay, having been beaten 4-1 by Manchester City in midweek. 'First half we were much better with the ball than in the last three or four games,' Poyet added. 'We are just missing that cutting edge but in the rest of the game we were quite good.'","Brendan Rodgers insists others must step up absence of Steven Gerrard .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Thousands of people marched in central Baghdad on Saturday to protest a proposed U.S.-Iraqi security agreement that would extend the presence of U.S. troops in the country after the end of the year. Thousands staged a mass march through Baghdad, Iraq, on Saturday to protest a planned U.S.-Iraq security deal. The political party of Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr called for the rally. At one point, several speakers at a podium addressed the mass of people, urging the Iraqi government to reject the proposal. ""End the U.S. occupation of Iraq!"" one speaker shouted in English. Hazem al-Araji, a senior al-Sadr aide, told protesters their voices would be heard in America. ""Thanks to you, to these voices and the millions of voices, George Bush will hear these millions of calls in his 'Black House' -- in which you shouted out, 'No, no, America!'"" he said.  Watch protesters wave flags, swarm street » . ""This talk and these words are that of the leader, Muqtada al-Sadr: Baghdad is free, free! America, get out. This voice does not reach the Green Zone. We want to hear everyone who is occupied in that area saying Baghdad is free, free, America get out!"" al-Araji exclaimed. Protesters clogged several streets in the capital, waving Iraqi flags and kicking up dust. The demonstration, the largest in Baghdad in several months, was largely peaceful. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said in Washington on Thursday a draft status-of-forces agreement authorizing the U.S. troop presence in Iraq had ""been agreed upon by U.S. and Iraqi negotiators"" and was being reviewed by the two governments. A U.N. mandate authorizing the U.S. troop presence in Iraq expires December 31, and U.S. officials are examining ""contingencies"" in case the Iraqi government is unable to sell the status-of-forces deal to the country's various factions, a senior Bush administration official said this week. The same official said negotiations on the pact had finished and the text was final. The official said the ""final"" draft calls for U.S. troops to be out of Iraqi cities by June 2009 and out of Iraq by the end of 2011 unless the Iraqis ask the United States to stay. The U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions, said negotiators had also ""reached a compromise"" on the issue of U.S. troops remaining immune from Iraqi law -- an issue that was a major hurdle in the talks. Baghdad has sought the power to arrest and try Americans accused of crimes not related to official military operations, plus jurisdiction over troops and contractors who commit grave mistakes in the course of their duties. The United States has insisted its troops and contractors remain immune from Iraqi law. CNN State Department Producer Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Proposed deal would extend U.S. troop presence in Iraq after end of the year .

"Rogers, 38, will play in next season's County Championship and Maynard is delighted with the signing.
""He has agreed to come in and bat at three for the summer and that's a real top signing for us, a marquee player,"" Maynard told BBC Radio Somerset.
""He is a great acquisition, I'm really looking forward to working with him.""
Maynard says the Sydney-born left-hander will be a huge asset to the side and will help support the opening duo of Marcus Trescothick and 21-year-old Tom Abell.
""I think it was quite evident that apart from Marcus and Tom at the top of the order, we needed a bit more stability at three.
""He's got a world of experience, he is still very athletic, he is a very fit lad, he has got that Aussie determination, that steely quality and we saw during the summer he is a high-class player on tough wickets.""
Rogers announced his retirement from Test cricket prior to this summer's Ashes series and Maynard hopes his experience can help the younger members of Somerset's squad.
""We can't stifle our young talent and ask Tom Abell to bat out of position. He has established himself as an opener, he still has a long way to go but has the potential to go all the way and bat for England for a number of years.
""Obviously Marcus is still at the top of his game. Chris has batted at three a number of times in his career and is happy there. Also it will give him time to bed in, he is a quality performer and we're hoping for an excellent season from him.""",Somerset director of cricket Matt Maynard has hailed the arrival of former Australian opener Chris Rogers as a marquee signing for next season.

Craig Revel Horwood has revealed how he owes his success to a ‘sugar daddy’ lover he met when he was just 17. The Strictly Come Dancing judge said the 43-year-old man paid for his dance lessons and helped kick-start his television career in return for ‘doing the dirty’. Revel Horwood, known for his acerbic comments on the BBC1 show, said the nature of the relationship meant he had previously been described by some as a ‘rent boy’. Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood has revealed how he owes his success to a 'sugar daddy' lover he met when he was just 17. Right, the dancer at 18 years old . The dancer made the revelations last night at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, where he also disclosed he is to undergo hip surgery in two weeks’ time. In a wide-ranging interview, he also discussed how celebrities found it uncomfortable to be ‘flung about by dancers’ on the popular show. Discussing his relationship with the older man, Revel Horwood, 48, said he was approached while he was living in his native Australia as a teenager. Describing him as ‘Mr X’ for legal reasons, Revel Horwood said: ‘It was this man who was 43 and I was 17. ‘He said I will pay for your classes but you come away with me and we do the dirty. ‘I suppose that could be compared to a lady getting engaged and getting a great big sparkling Tiffany ring – and then breaking off the engagement but keeping the ring.’ At the time, Revel Horwood had left school and was training as a chef, but said he ‘hated’ it, adding that Mr X ‘saved me from that’. Revel Horwood has become known for his acerbic comments on BBC1 show Strictly Come Dancing . However, Revel Horwood did not divulge any further details of the relationship and quickly moved on to other subjects. Talking about his imminent hip surgery, Revel Horwood said it would clash with filming for the current series. He said: ‘I’m going in at six o’clock in the morning on Sunday after filming Saturday night live. ‘I will be watching myself on the telly . on Sunday night [the results show screened on Sunday is filmed on . Saturday night] with my old hip and I’ll have a new one in.’ He added: . ‘I will be made of titanium and I can’t wait, darling.’ Asked whether he would be fit to return to the show the following week, he said he might have to face the cameras and the audience in a wheelchair, adding: ‘A fabulous glittery one I hope.’ He also revealed how celebrities found it difficult being ‘manhandled’. ‘Sometimes you throw a girl up and she will fart and come back down,’ he joked. In his latest book, Tales From the Dance Floor, Revel Horwood wrote about how fellow Strictly judge Darcey Bussell breaks wind on set. Last night he said he had not warned her before the book was published – and the first thing she said to him when she saw him after reading it was, ‘Fart?’ But he added she had taken it well and spent the entire night’s filming leaning to one side and pretending to break wind. ‘We were in stitches,’ he said.","Craig Revel Horwood says he owes his success to a 'sugar daddy' lover .

"By . Rebecca Evans . and Vanessa Allen . Hacked to death: Lt Col David Parkinson (right) was attacked by five intruders as he was sleeping beside his wife of 35 years, Sonja (left), in Kenya . A gang that hacked to death a former Parachute Regiment officer in Kenya may be linked to a previous attack on a British couple, police revealed yesterday. Nature reserve manager Lt Col David Parkinson, 58, was killed by five robbers at his remote home. They took the equivalent of  £1.90 in cash plus a laptop and bottles of wine after Sonja Parkinson, 52, managed to escape and barricade herself in the house’s panic room. A local man has been detained and questioned over the attack on the Parkinsons but has not been formally arrested in connection with Sunday’s break-in at their home in Lolldaiga Hills, near Mount Kenya National Park. The couple were asleep when the robbers used smashed their way into their bedroom  and demanded money and guns. Mrs Parkinson was tied up and threatened and her husband attacked as he fought to defend her. Police believe he may have been knocked  unconscious before being struck with broad-bladed machetes, known locally as pangas. Lt Co Parkinson, from Brighton. East Sussex, was formerly a director of Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya, where Prince William spent part of his gap year. He was awarded an OBE in 1998 for his military service. Police said there were parallels with the robbery and a raid on the home of another former British army officer and his wife in the region in June. Two men are expected to face trial for  that attack, but two other raiders had not been traced. It is likely that Lt Col Parkinson bled to death during a raid in which by an armed gang stole a laptop, $3 and bottles of wine. A former grammar school pupil from Brighton, he was awarded an OBE at St James’ Palace by Prince Charles in 1998 for his military service. Last night, Kenyan police said the retired soldier’s hand was cut off as he struggled with the intruders in order to give his wife enough time to reach safety. Local police chief Maurice Tum said the robbers gained entry by smashing the windows and ordered Lt Col Parkinson to hand over money and guns.

Tragedy: Lt Col David Parkinson was killed in the farmhouse of the Lolldaiga Hills ranch in Kenya (pictured) He added: ‘A fight ensured between the men and the soldier and they cut off his left hand and left him bleeding profusely. 'The . wife hid in the strong room. It was this decision which saved her. She . came out and found her bleeding husband and contacted the police.’ Lt Col Parkinson, who served in the Army for 30 years, became manager of the ranch after leaving Lewa in 2008. Before taking up his place at St Andrews University, Prince William spent his gap year at Lewa, helping with various conservation projects. In 2010, he and Kate holidayed there, staying in a secluded rustic log cabin where William proposed. The Duchess said: ‘He’s a true romantic and we had a wonderful holiday in Africa. It was very romantic and it was a very personal time for both of us.’ Last night the Duke of Cambridge, who is a patron of Lewa, said he was ‘saddened’ to hear about Lt Col Parkinson’s death. Mrs Parkinson, who owns a local arts and crafts company called Mitumba Art, was taken to hospital and treated for shock. 'Saddened': The soldier was formerly a director of Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, where Prince William (right) spent his gap year as a 19-year-old and where he proposed to Kate Middleton (left, with Prince George) A friend and neighbour said: ‘He was very . dynamic, doing an amazing job in Lolldaiga for both conservation and . the community. He was a very well-liked man.’ Lt Col Parkinson joined the Army in 1973 after graduating from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. 'A fight ensured between the men and the soldier and they cut off his left hand and left him bleeding profusely' Maurice Tum, local Kenyan police chief . Known to his fellow soldiers as Parky, he joined the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces, before becoming chief instructor at Sandhurst. On his last tour before retiring, he commanded the British Army training organisation in Nairobi. In 2003, he and his wife permanently relocated to Kenya where he took up his post with Lewa, a growing conservation and community development project. The couple sold their home in Hassocks, West Sussex, for £500,000 three years later. They have two daughters, Anna, 33 and Renate, 29. Lt Col Parkinson took up the post with Lolldaiga Hills at the start of this year.

"By . Gerri Peev . Ed Miliband was told by one of his MPs to ‘get out more’ as his electoral strategy was condemned as suicidal. The Labour leader was hit with bruising criticism by his party’s rising star Simon Danczuk just days before local and European elections. Polls show Labour’s lead over the  Conservatives has fallen to four points, down from six. On European voting intentions, Labour is on 24 per cent, languishing behind Ukip (35 per cent) but ahead of the Conservatives (20 per cent). Bruising criticism: Ed Miliband and Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk at a dinner in 2012 . Mr Danczuk, the MP for Rochdale, said the election had to be about  winning over Tory and Ukip voters. ‘I think Ed needs to be less cautious. He should have probably debated with Farage along with Nick Clegg. That would probably have been a smart move in terms of putting Cameron on the back foot. I also think he needs to get out more,’ he said. He told BBC Radio 5Live’s Pienaar’s Politics: ‘What we also need to do is occupy the centre ground and that is where we will get the breakthrough. 'So we need to be stronger on immigration; welfare. We need to be seen in a more positive way in relation to business.’ Mr Danczuk has criticised the strategy of Douglas Alexander, Mr Miliband’s campaign co-ordinator, to rely on securing 35 per cent of the popular vote. Mr Danczuk, the MP for Rochdale, made his cutting remarks on BBC Radio 5Live days before local and European elections . This would be enough to win the  general election according to some strategists because constituency boundaries favour Labour. But Mr Danczuk has said Labour should not rely on the Coalition’s ‘unpopularity’ to win the 2015 contest. ‘Now we need to up our game,’ Mr Danczuk wrote in an article for the Mail on Sunday. He added that ‘continually reciting a mantra of misery is not the answer’, and warned that the party will not win by relying on a ‘core vote and a few disgruntled Liberals’ – which he described as ‘a suicidal strategy’. Mr Miliband is being threatened with further open dissent if his party does not gain seats in Thursday’s poll. A Labour candidate for one of the party’s target seats condemned his leadership as ‘dodgy and incoherent’. Tristan Osborne, candidate for Chatham and Aylesford, was recorded making critical remarks about Mr Miliband’s strategy. ‘The machine is not functioning in any capacity,’ Mr Osborne said at a £100-a-ticket Labour fundraising event held on Tuesday. ‘We need to be appealing to the aspirational Southern voter.’ Mr Miliband dismissed as  ‘nonsense’ suggestions that he had hired David Axelrod, Barack Obama’s election guru, to give him a makeover. Quizzed by Sky’s Dermot Murnaghan, he said: ‘This makeover stuff is nonsense...I can absolutely promise that I have never talked to David Axelrod about the colour of my tie.’ Mr Miliband also defended a Labour party TV ad which attacked David Cameron and Nick Clegg as out-of-touch posh boys. He insisted he was not waging class war based on which school the Prime Minister went to. ‘It is about what he believes and what he does,’ he said. The wheels came off Ed Miliband’s efforts to pick up votes in Newcastle – when the Labour leader picked up a parking ticket instead. Mr Miliband’s driver was given a fine while waiting for his boss in a loading bay during an election campaign visit last week. A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘The car should not have been parked in this bay. The fine has already been paid.’ Bookies will be hit with a new tax to fund future sports stars and anti-corruption  programmes if Labour wins the election. Ed Miliband promised to hit the gambling industry as it ‘puts nothing back’ into sports such as football, tennis and cricket, which earned it vast profits. But bookies hit back, saying they were already pouring millions into sport through TV rights and sponsorship.","Simon Danczuk hit Labour leader with bruising criticism on Radio 5Live .

"(CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is ordering that more than 1,000 Boeing 737 jets be inspected for a problem which could cause pilots to lose control of the aircraft. According to the FAA, the inspections will focus on pins which attach the horizontal stabilizers to the fuselage. They were prompted by reports that a coating used to protect the pins from wear and corrosion was applied incorrectly. The FAA says premature failure of the pins could cause reduced structural integrity of the horizontal stabilizer to fuselage attachment, resulting in loss of control of the airplane. The part number of each pin must be checked and pins with certain part numbers must be replaced with new, improved attach pins. The order, called an Airworthiness Directive, is effective May 20 and applies to Boeing 737 series 600, 700, 700-C, 800, 900 and 900-ER aircraft. The inspections are not expected to affect airline schedules. The aircraft included in the directive are relatively new, entering service in 1998 or later.","FAA says a problem with attach pins could cause pilots to lose control of aircraft .

"Chapel Hill, N.C. (CNN) -- Margo Balboni is cramming college into three years to cut down on the cost of her student loans. As it is, the University of North Carolina sophomore expects to graduate in a few years with $20,000 in debt. ""I try not to think about it too much,"" said Balboni, ""The last thing I want is to be financially dependent on my parents."" Balboni is scared of the student loan bills she may face when she graduates in a few years. But come July, millions of college graduates may see their payments jump. That's when the interest rate on federally subsidized college loans is set to double. Unless Congress decides to freeze current interest rates, the more than 7 million Americans will see their annual rates jump from 3.4% to 6.8%. Just the thought of that, said Balboni, ""definitely makes my anxiety go up several notches."" The issue is fast becoming a political football, and one President Barack Obama hopes to score with young voters. But his likely Republican opponent is trying to take the ball off the field by also supporting the freeze. Romney camp: Why we will get the young people . This week, Obama begins an all-out push for Congress to extend the low rates on these loans. ""We can't make higher education a luxury,"" he said during a rally in North Carolina Tuesday.

That message is red meat to the college crowd, a group the president has to energize in big numbers before November. In 2008, the president won two-thirds of 18-29 year olds. Sen. John McCain won 32%. That year young voters made up one-fifth of the electorate. That may not sound like a large enough voting block to decide an election but, on the state level, young voters can make a big difference. In North Carolina during the last election, Obama won by just 1%, or 14,177 votes. But he carried the state's young voters by an overwhelming 74%. The youth vote clearly helped provide a cushion for his upset victory and the state's 15 electoral votes. Since then, the dynamic has changed. Youth turnout dropped 6% between the 2008 presidential election and the 2010 midterms. Though a drop off in turnout among young voters is predictable when there's no presidential candidate on the ticket, there are other reasons the Obama team has to worry about a lower turnout. Young people have been hit especially hard during the recession, with more than half of recent college graduates unemployed or underemployed. And a recent Harvard University Institute of Politics survey showed that while young people still overwhelmingly support Obama, they are now less likely to vote this fall, more disillusioned about the economy and politics in general. ""It's not too late for Obama to relight some fires,"" said Hodding Carter, Public Policy Professor at UNC. ""I do not think it's possible for him to ignite the kind of conflagration in the entire youth that he did last time."" Carter believes young voters are easily disillusioned by the gridlock in Washington. They ""essentially looked up and said 'but it didn't work right away so the hell with it.' And that's always a problem with the youth vote."" Student loan rate hike: What you need to know . So the president is now stepping up his effort to appeal to young voters. This week he's visiting college campuses in states he carried in 2008 and those that will be in play in 2012 -- North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa. He is pushing the ""keep-college-loans-affordable"" message and pointing the finger at Republicans. His speech in North Carolina included an attack on a Republican congresswoman for her position on student loans. He didn't mention her name but the president recounted the comments of Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC) who had told a talk radio host that she had ""very little tolerance"" for students who graduate with large amounts of debt. ""Can you imagine that?"" the president asked the crowd, which responded with loud boos. What he doesn't mention is that Romney came out this week in favor of extending a freeze on the current interest rates. ""With the number of college graduates who can't find work or who can only find work well beneath their skill level, I fully support the effort to extend the low interest rate on student loans,"" Romney said before a campaign event in Astor, Pennsylvania on Monday. Romney is making a play to dampen enthusiasm for the president among young voters. At the Pennsylvania event he told reporters, ""I think this is a time when young people are questioning the support they gave to President Obama three and a half years ago."" One issue the Romney campaign is certain to hit on: the unemployment rate among 20-24 year olds is five points higher than the national average. In his comments on the youth vote, Romney added, ""He (the president) promised a future with good jobs and good opportunity; that hasn't happened."" But it may be in the administration's interests to keep the subject in the headlines, continuing to suggest that the Republicans will stand in the way of a deal. It will cost the United States $6 billion to extend the student loans for just one year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. John Kline, the Republican chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee, has called it an ""untenable situation"" in which ""we must now choose between allowing interest rates to rise or piling billions of dollars on the backs of taxpayers."" Kline said he is working to find ""a responsible solution"" -- a way to pay for an extension of the freeze. On Tuesday, Obama attacked Congress for continuing subsidies for oil companies and for its failure to increase taxes on the wealthy, leading the crowd to chants of ""no!"" to questions such as ""Do we want tax cuts for the rich?"" The current interest rate reduction passed with bipartisan support in 2007, but Republicans have pointed out that then-Sen. Obama missed two votes on the issue. The White House has pointed out the president was campaigning at the time and was prepared to return to cast his ballot if needed for the vote; then-Sen. Joe Biden and Sens. Chris Dodd and John McCain also missed the vote. The back and forth in Washington is seen as just more noise to the students who face a rate increase on July 1. Balboni, the UNC sophomore, said her biggest fear is the possibility she'll be so deeply in debt, she'll have to move into her parent's home after graduation. ""Yeah it's the 800-pound guerilla in the room. It's everyone's plan Z. Nobody wants to go all the way to that.""","College grads face student loan rates that could double if Congress doesn't act .

"David Cameron has branded Islamic State terrorists who killed British aid worker Alan Henning 'brutal and repulsive' as the Prime Minister led a wave of global revulsion over the murder. He vowed to 'hunt down' and bring to justice the man who wielded the knife, who has become known as Jihadi John - as Barack Obama, Nick Clegg and Muslim leaders all spoke of their disgust. Mr Henning, 47, a father-of-two, was filmed being murdered in a video posted on the internet three weeks after he was last paraded in front of a camera. Scroll down for video . David Cameron has branded the Islamic State 'brutal and repulsive' tonight after British aid worker Alan Henning was filmed being beheaded by the terrorist dubbed Jihadi John . In a strongly-worded statement, Mr Cameron said: 'We will do all we can to hunt down these murderers and bring them to justice.' He added: 'My thoughts and prayers tonight are with Alan’s wife Barbara, their children and all those who loved him. ‘Alan had gone to Syria to help get aid to people of all faiths in their hour of need. 'The fact that he was taken hostage when trying to help others and now murdered demonstrates that there are no limits to the depravity of these ISIL terrorists. David Cameron received a security briefing this morning before calling the slaying of Alan Henning 'completely unforgivable' Aid worker Alan Henning, 44, a father-of-two, was kidnapped by Islamist rebels on Boxing Day last year . This morning, Downing Street revealed that Mr Cameron was meeting with officials from the intelligence agencies, the military and the Foreign Office at his official country residence Chequers to discuss the killing. Later this morning, he called the slaying 'completely unforgivable' adding that there was 'no level of depravity to which they will not sink'. 'No appeals made any difference,""Mr Cameron told Sky News. 'The murder of Alan Henning is absolutely abhorrent, it is senseless, it is completely unforgivable. Anyone in any doubt about this organisation can now see how truly repulsive it is, and barbaric it is,' he said of IS. When asked whether he believed the extremists would kill more of their Western hostages, Cameron suggested the only way to stop them was through military action. 'The fact that this was a kind, gentle, compassionate and caring man who had simply gone to help others, the fact they could murder him in the way they did, shows what we are dealing with,' he said. Nick Clegg took to Twitter to praise Mr Henning, saying he worked to 'selflessly help those in need' 'This is going to be our struggle now. ... We must do everything we can to defeat this organisation. We must take action against it. We must find those responsible.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg praised Mr Henning on Twitter, saying: 'Sincere condolences to Alan Henning's family. Barbaric actions of ISIL are held in complete contempt. 'We are resolved to defeat this evil. Alan Henning was a man moved to selflessly help those most in need and we should remember that above all else at this difficult time.' Labour leader Ed Miliband said: 'The murder of Alan Henning by ISIL is appalling and barbaric. 'He was an aid worker, helping those in need. Those who killed him have revealed only their lack of humanity and brutality. 'My thoughts and deepest condolences are with his wife Barbara, his children and all those who knew him. 'We will do everything we can to support the efforts of the Government to bring those guilty of this terrible act to justice.' U.S. President Barack Obama said: 'The United States strongly condemns the brutal murder of United Kingdom citizen Alan Henning by the terrorist group ISIL. 'Mr Henning worked to help improve the lives of the Syrian people and his death is a great loss for them, for his family, and for the people of the United Kingdom. 'Standing together with our UK friends and allies, we will work to bring the perpetrators of Alan's murder - as well as the murders of Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff and David Haines - to justice. 'Standing together with a broad coalition of allies and parteners, we will continue taking decisive action to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.' The American ambassador to the UK Matthew Barzun said this morning: 'Today, we stand with the UK in joint determination, resolve and commitment to achieve justice for Alan Henning.' Imams  had joined forces before Mr Henning's execution to appeal to the terrorists to release the former taxi driver from Salford, who left his job to travel to Syria to take help to victims of its civil war. Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, a Muslim charity, called Henning 'a British hero.' His 'barbaric killing is an attack against all decent people around the world,' Shafiq said. Dr Shuja Shafi, Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: 'This reported murder is a despicable and offensive act, coming as it does on the eve of the Muslim festival of Eid Al-Adha. 'It is quite clear that the murderers of Alan Henning have no regard for Islam, or for the Muslims around the world who pleaded for his life. Barack Obama condemned the killing, and reiterated his promise to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' ISIS . 'Alan was a friend of Muslims, and he will be mourned by Muslims. In this period of Hajj and this festival of Eid, Muslims remember the mercy of God and the emphasis God places on human life. 'Alan Henning's murderers have clearly gone against that spirit of Islam. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family.' Hanif Qadir, founder of Active Change Foundation – the organisation behind the #Notinmyname campaign said: 'The fact that they have chosen to commit this barbaric act on the eve of the Eid al-adha, a global expression of forgiveness and mercy among Muslims, only demonstrates the extent of the evil and barbaric nature of these criminals. 'They have not shown any ounce of mercy or compassion and are therefore totally against Islam and are hell-bent on killing innocent individuals and must be stopped. 'As a British Muslim I urge every other Muslim in the UK to stand up and refute these terrorists and distance themselves from this brutality and false Islam.' In footage released on social media, Mr Henning is shown being beheaded by Jihadi John, the Islamist fighter who was also behind the killings of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and British aid worker David Haines. Former Foreign Office minister Baroness Warsi, the first Muslim woman in the Cabinet, tweeted her condolences, saying the Mr Hennning was the 'true martyr.' Liberal Democrat party president Tim Farron said: ‘Alan Henning should be remembered for what he was - a kind hearted, selfless man who wanted to help others. My prayers are with his family.’ Inspire, an anti-extremist campaign group of British Muslim women, described Mr Henning's death as 'an affront to all Muslims across the world'. Co-director Sara Khan expressed her 'heartfelt condolences' to the family of the aid worker, who she described as an 'amazing man, a man of courage, a man of dignity, a man of integrity'. She said: 'The only thing that the killing of Alan has achieved is greater revulsion for ISIS and the fact that more people from across our world, within our communities, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, are united in their stance against their barbarity and inhumanity. Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, a Muslim charity, called Alan Henning (pictured) 'a British hero.' 'The murder of Alan Henning is a brutal and criminal act of terror that is an affront to all Muslims across the world.' Former head of the Army, General The Lord Dannatt said the deaths of hostages were sadly 'part of the harsh price' to be paid in confronting the 'abomination' of IS. 'Our Government is now standing up to its responsibilities and part of the harsh price, while this takes time, is that sadly if they have hostages in their hands, these atrocious things seem to be happening and seem to be going to continue to happen,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today. He renewed his call for the UK to extend military operations to Syria, where the US and other allies are conducting air strikes, saying this country was 'practically not doing enough'. 'Dealing with half a problem is not going to solve the problem,' he said. 'If the Americans have found a way to be able to do this then actually we should be doing it.' This morning, Mr Cameron met with officials from the intelligence agencies, the military and the Foreign Office at his official country residence Chequers to discuss the killing. Afterwards, a Downing Street statement said the Prime Minister had raised a second video showing a British ISIL fighter unmasked delivering a further message - and that police were investigating 'urgently' for 'possible terrorism offences' relating to it. A second video, published by Islamic State last night, shows an injured British fighter challenging David Cameron to send ground troops to Iraq. The fighter is believed to be a former Morrisons security guard who flew to Syria . It comes after footage emerged last night of an injured British fighter challenging David Cameron to send ground troops to Iraq. In a rant directed at ‘that despicable swine David Cameron’, the unmasked jihadi said: ‘Send them all, send your reserves and your backup and we’ll send them back one by one in coffins.’ It is understood the jihadist in the video is former supermarket security guard Omar Hussain. The 27-year-old from High Wycombe previously worked for Morrisons as a security guard. He lived with his mother and brothers before travelling to Syria in January 2014. The Downing Street statement said: 'The PM was clear that we must keep doing all we can to ensure that these terrorists are found and brought to justice for their heinous crimes and we will keep working with our US partners and those in the region to do this. 'ISIL’s brutality will not persuade us to change our approach. 'Indeed, the senseless murder of an innocent man only reinforces our resolve to defeat this terrorist organisation and to eradicate the threat they pose to Britons - whether those in the region or here on the streets of the UK. 'At the meeting, the Prime Minister also raised a second video released last night which shows an apparent British ISIL fighter unmasked delivering a further message. 'The police are urgently investigating the contents of the video, including possible terrorism offences relating to it.'","David Cameron vows to hunt down terrorists behind Mr Henning's killing .

"Two brand new iPhones and the Apple Watch have finally been unveiled but Australian customers can expect to fork out 25 percent more than the US for one of the new handsets when they hit the market next week. The larger iPhone handsets, which were unveiled in the US on Wednesday morning, will first hit the market on September 19 and you can pre-order one from Friday. Prices for the iPhone 6 start from $869, compared with $649 in the US. The iPhone 6 Plus will retail from $999 in Australia and $749 abroad. The brand new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus range were unveiled in the US on Wednesday morning by Apple chief executive Tim Cook . Apple will sell the iPhone 6 in gold, silver and grey and prices will start at $869 for the 16GB model and $999 for the 64GB. For the first time, Apple will sell a 128GB model for $1,129. The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen and curved edges, with 38 percent more pixels on the screen than the iPhone 5s. But that's not the biggest model Apple is planning on selling in the new range. The iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen and 185 percent more pixels than the 5S. Like the iPhone 6, the Plus model is also sold in gold, silver and grey but it's naturally more expensive. The iPhone 6 (centre) has a 4.7-inch screen, curved edges and will be available in dark black and gold, while the iPhone 6 Plus (right) has a 5.5-inch screen and 185 per cent more pixels than the 5S (left) The larger and newer iPhone handsets will first hit the market on September 19 and Australian customers can pre-order from this Friday . It will start from $999 for the 16GB model, $1,129 for the 64GB model and $1,249 for a 128GB handset. The latest iPhone, the 5s, currently retails for $749 for the 16GB model. But the anticipated Apple Watch, which is the company's first foray into the world of wearable items, won't be around until early 2015. Apple fans Salvatore Gerace (left) and Christian ibrahim get in line early for the new iPhone 6 at the Apple Store in Sydney, Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2014. While an Australian price for the watch hasn't yet been announced, it will retail in the US from $349. The watch, which received a standing ovation when it was unveiled, has a rectangular bezel, rectangular sapphire crystal screen, curved edges and is made of metal. It will come in three finishes - Apple Watch, which comes in silver, the Apple Watch Sport and the Apple Watch Edition, which will be available in 18-karat gold. Prices for the iPhone 6 start from $869, compared with $649 in the US. The iPhone 6 Plus will retail from $999 in Australia and $749 abroad . Apple haven't specified what the battery life was like on the Apple Watch, but did say it would need to be charged each night. The watch works 'seamlessly' with the iPhone 5C, 5S as well as the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and it lets users dictate messages via a microphone on the device. Australian retailers are said to be gearing up to battle it out over the new iPhone range. Optus fired the first canon on Sunday when it revealed people who abandon their existing contracts with rival companies would be given credit to offset cancellation charges if they move to a 24-month Optus plan. The anticipated Apple Watch, which is the company's first foray into the world of wearable items, won't be around until early 2015 . While an Australian price for the watch hasn't yet been announced, it will retail in the US from $349 . The move is timed to take advantage of the pre-Christmas influx of new smartphone models, such as the newly unveiled iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Telsyte senior analyst Foad Fadaghi said Optus' rivals would likely launch aggressive counter strategies in the coming months. 'This is a win for consumers if we see increased competition around the launch of the new (Apple) handset (and) some of the barriers come down for switching,' Mr Fadaghi said.

"(CNN) -- The human rights group Amnesty International is calling on the United Nations to impose an arms embargo on Israel and the Palestinians, saying both sides used weapons supplied from abroad to carry out attacks on civilians during their three-week conflict in Gaza. Palestinian children make coffee behind a bullet and rocket riddled wall in Rafah, Gaza, on January 24, 2009. The London-based group issued a 38-page report Sunday night that detailed ""evidence of war crimes and other serious violations of international law by all parties."" Israeli forces used white phosphorus and other weapons supplied by the United States, killing hundreds of civilians and destroying homes, the group said. The use of white phosphorus is restricted under international law. In the early days of the Gaza conflict, the Israel Defense Forces denied using the ordnance. But later, Israeli officials said only that any shells fired in Gaza were ""in accordance with international law."" Amnesty said its researchers found munitions fragments littering school playgrounds, hospitals and homes after the 22-day fighting in Gaza ended in January. Many of the munitions used by the Israeli army were American-made, and included bombs, white phosphorus remains and missiles seemingly launched from unmanned drones, Amnesty said. ""To a large extent, Israel's military offensive in Gaza was carried out with weapons, munitions and military equipment supplied by the U.S.A. and paid for with U.S. taxpayers' money,"" Malcolm Smart, Amnesty's Middle East director, said in the report. He called on the United States to immediately suspend military aid to Israel. The United States is to provide $30 billion in military aid to Israel under a 10-year agreement that runs till 2017 -- a 25-percent increase compared with the period preceding the Bush administration, Amnesty said. The group also took to task Hamas, the Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007. It said it found remains of Qassam and Grad rockets fired by Palestinian armed groups in civilian areas. Grad rockets have a longer range than the crude, home-made Qassams. Israel said Palestinian militants have fired about 10,000 rockets and mortars into Israel in the past eight years. ""These unsophisticated weapons are either smuggled into Gaza clandestinely or constructed there from components secretly brought in from abroad,"" Amnesty said. Israel's foreign ministry responded harshly to the report, calling it biased and ""dedicated almost exclusively to the censure of Israel."" The ministry said the report does not mention Hamas' ""deliberate use"" of civilians as human shields. It also said Israel's use of weapons complied with international law and denied that its forces targeted civilians. ""The comparison of the supply of weapons to Israel and the Hamas in inappropriate,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""Israel is a sovereign nation that is obligated to use force to protect its citizens, while Hamas is a terror organization."" Israel launched the attack on Hamas in Gaza on December 27 with the stated aim of ending rocket attacks on southern Israel. More than 1,300 Palestinians died and about 5,400 others were wounded. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, were killed in the fighting. Since the two sides declared a cease-fire on January 21, militants have sporadically fired rockets into Israel. Israel has responded with airstrikes.","Amnesty International calls for U.N. arms embargo on Israel and Palestinians .

"(CNN) -- As recently as 2011, Hillary Clinton was seen by many as a respected but polarizing figure: Smart and accomplished, sure, but controlled and somewhat humorless. In the infamous faint praise of her rival-turned-boss Barack Obama, she was ""likable enough."" Three years later, she seems somehow hipper, looser and more ... human. As we inch toward the 2016 election, she's presented a new online persona. While Clinton has embraced social media, it hasn't always loved her back, as seen most recently on her current book tour. The Internet has used every opportunity to turn her words and actions into memes, not all of them flattering. So what happened? How did Hillary Clinton suddenly go viral? You can trace the change back to October 18, 2011, when then-Secretary of State Clinton was traveling with her staff on a C-17 military plane from Malta to Tripoli, Libya. Nobody knew its importance at the time, but that's the day Reuters' Kevin Lamarque and TIME's Diana Walker snapped a handful of photos that would soon become iconic: Clinton, in oversize black shades and a no-nonsense expression, checking her BlackBerry at a makeshift desk as staffers mingled behind her. ""Okay, nice image I thought, but we were about to land in Tripoli which was certain to yield the images that the world would really want to see,"" Lamarque wrote in a blog post months later. ""Photographers, you never really know when your pictures will resurface and what use they will be to someone out there."" 5 things to watch in Hillary Clinton town hall . Texts From Hillary . You know the rest. Six months later, the photos were all over the Internet, thanks to two journalists with an idea that started as a joke at a bar. In April 2012, Stacy Lambe and Adam Smith launched a blog, Texts From Hillary, that showed fictional text-message exchanges between Clinton, from her seat on the plane, and a range of celebrities. There she was rejecting a Mark Zuckerberg friend request, telling a flirty Ryan Gosling to call her ""Madame Secretary,"" blowing off Jon Stewart by saying she's already booked on Colbert and responding to Obama's ""Hey Hil, whatchu doing?"" with ""Running the world."" As the perfect vessels for deadpan mockery in the social media age, the posts and related Twitter feed soon were everywhere. Within days, Clinton invited Lambe and Smith to her office at the State Department, where she initiated a group photo of the trio texting on their phones. Although its makers shuttered the blog only a week later -- ""Once you meet the subject of your meme ... it's very hard to top that,"" Smith told CNN -- Clinton's image was altered almost overnight. ""During the 2008 Democratic primary, Barack Obama had a lock on young people, technology chic and the press. Hillary was regarded by kids as the lady who'd been around a long time, wearing headbands and pantsuits,"" Maureen Dowd wrote that week in The New York Times. ""Now she's quick to laugh at herself and take advantage of the positive buzz,"" Dowd continued. Building a brand on Twitter . A few months after Clinton stepped down as secretary of state in early 2013, she joined Twitter. Her first tweet thanked Lambe and Smith for the inspiration and then said, ""I'll take it from here ... #tweetsfromhillary."" It was retweeted more than 10,000 times. And her Twitter bio became an instant classic of the form. It reads: ""Wife, mom, lawyer, women & kids advocate, FLOAR, FLOTUS, US Senator, SecState, author, dog owner, hair icon, pantsuit aficionado, glass ceiling cracker, TBD..."" Soon Clinton was posting childhood photos of husband Bill on his birthday, tributes to the late Nelson Mandela, a portrait of her with members of Russian band Pussy Riot and pleas for such pet causes as elephant poaching and empowering women in the developing world. ""She has really embraced the platform in the right way. She has humanized herself and her brand,"" said Shama Hyder, CEO of the Marketing Zen Group. ""Today, participating in digital media isn't a choice,"" Hyder added.""Your digital footprint is created regardless of your participation, and any smart politician knows that it is best to help curate that image vs. leaving others to define it for you."" Clinton also has shown flashes of self-mocking humor, as when she tweeted a joke during the Super Bowl in February about how she enjoyed watching ""someone else being blitzed and sacked"" on Fox for a change. Today, Clinton, 66, has 1.5 million Twitter followers, many who may not even remember her eight years in the White House. At least for now, she seems more comfortable in her skin -- witness the photos of her wearing thick glasses and almost no makeup -- although that may change if she runs for president again. The Internet isn't always nice . But getting the attention of the Internet is not always a good thing. Anything Clinton says has the potential to go viral, for worse as well as better. In January 2013, Clinton was fighting back criticism before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee during a hearing about the attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya. ""With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,"" she said. ""Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator."" The Twitter-sphere quickly seized on the outburst, and within hours, #WhatDifferenceDoesItMake was trending. Not only did the hashtag spread, but so did a graphic of Clinton's 2008 campaign sign juxtaposed with the phrase ""What difference does it make?"" Earlier this month, as she promoted her new book, ""Hard Choices,"" Clinton was trending again . In an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer, Clinton said she and former President Bill Clinton were ""dead broke"" and ""struggled to piece together the resources"" for mortgages in pricey Washington and the New York suburbs along with their daughter Chelsea's tuition at Stanford University. Clinton sought to clarify her comment, saying simply that she and her husband have known periods in their lives when they struggled to pay off debt, but the damage was done. Her Twitter critics turned #HillaryIsSoPoor into a mocking hashtag. Once and future candidate? Criticism aside, should Clinton run for president in the 2016 election, digital-branding experts believe the reborn, tech-savvy Clinton will resonate better with voters, especially young ones. Marketing guru Marian Salzman believes the old Clinton hid her personality behind the security wall of public service. The new Clinton is undergoing a swift digital makeover, said Salzman, CEO of Havas PR North America. ""How can she modernize, and fast? Get online and exude an ageless hipster style that takes away the pain of the proximity between her age and the age of Ronald Reagan (69) when he took office,"" Salzman told CNN. ""The sudden burst of intellectual energy, even in 140 characters, reinforces she is of these times and living the now."" Salzman believes Clinton must be her authentic self on social media to appear more relatable to voters. ""She needs humor and self awareness -- we don't want Mrs. Thatcher,"" she said, referring to the sometimes imperious former British prime minister. ""She needs to be of the people, and with them."" It can't hurt to keep posting more personal messages such as her ""My most exciting title yet: Grandmother-To-Be!"" tweet congratulating Chelsea and husband Marc Mezvinsky on expecting their first child. Hyder, of the Marketing Zen Group, believes Clinton still wants to be president and has realized ""she can no longer sit on the sidelines"" when it comes to digital media. ""I believe it has helped her garner many new fans and will continue to play a huge role in building her brand,"" Hyder told CNN. ""The last time Ms. Clinton had presidential aspirations, there wasn't a strong sense of her as a person. The public had a very one dimensional image. ""Using digital media in this way allows her to present a fuller ... more human picture. If she does decide to run, it could be a decisive factor.""

A 14-year-old Florida boy who was given a slim chance of survival after he was crushed under a bus two months ago has made a miraculous recovery. Jerry Cunningham, from Pompano Beach, was running to hold a Broward County bus for his mother on May 10 when his arm got stuck in the door and the distracted driver dragged him along the road and then pulled him under the vehicle, which weighed 20-tons. The shocking incident, which was captured on surveillance video, left the eighth grader with fractures to his face, ribs and ankle and he was put in a medically induced coma. Doctors gave him a slim chance of survival. But, after two months in hospital, Cunningham is going home today. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO - WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Recovery: Jerry Cunningham, pictured, a 14-year-old Pompano Beach boy who was given a slim chance of survival after he was crushed under a bus two months ago has made a miraculous recovery . 'I always say my son is a miracle because he's alive and nobody knows how,' his father, Gerard Cunningham, said, according to the Miami Herald. The teen was rushed to Broward Health Medical center after the horrific accident. Cunningham said his prognosis was grim when he arrived. The next few days would be critical for the 14-year-old. 'After the fifth day he woke up. He opened his eyes,' his father said. 'That day the doctor said it's a 50-50 chance. So we've been waiting day by day.' On June 13, Jerry was transferred to Jackson Memorial Hospital. 'On the second day that I was here, he called me Dad. On the second day he called Mom, Dad, so he started talking and I saw him, he walks, he laughs,' Cunningham said. Miracle: The teen, pictured, was given a slim chance of survival by doctors . Injuries: Cunningham, pictured left and right, suffered fractures to his face, ribs and ankle and he was put in a medically induced coma . Emotional: Jerry's father, Gerald Cunningham, pictured, became emotional talking about his son's recovery at a press conference . Jerry suffered a severe traumatic brain . injury and the damage to his left leg meant he couldn't put weight on. He had to be fed through a tube. 'He didn't know where he was, who he was, what was going on. He didn't know anything,' said Seema Khurana, director of pediatric rehabilitation at Jackson, according to the Miami Herald. After a week at Jackson, the teen was sleeping, answering some questions and had put weight on his foot. He was improving every day. 'He is a miracle,' she told the Sun Sentinel, adding that his parents have been at Jerry's bedside and at his therapies sessions every day, which has made a big difference. Cunningham makes his son a special breakfast every morning and quizzes him on the menu to help with his memory. 'That's part of the therapy. They do their part and I do mine,' Cunningham said. When he gets home, Jerry will begin . stage two of his recovery as an outpatient. This involves three sessions . of therapy a week and lessons with a teacher. He has already learned to walk again by himself, though he's still shaky and requires supervision. 'He's like a baby,' his father said. 'He's not a 14-year-old boy, but rather a baby that has to learn everything again.' His . memory, however, is the biggest deficit, speech pathologist Jennifer . Rey said. She said he was able to remember things right away, but . forgets after a few seconds. But his long-term memory remains intact and . doctors are hopeful his retention will improve. Jerry's . father became overcome at a press conference at the hospital on . Wednesday and thanked the medical teams who saved his son's life. 'The therapists and these people are miracle workers,' he said, almost in tears, 'excellent.' Before the drama: Cunningham is caught on one of the bus's camera running to catch up to the then-stationary bus . Stuck: This grab shows Cunningham catch up to the bus as the doors are closing . Help! Cunningham, pictured outside the bus, bangs on the doors after the vehicle takes off with his arm stuck inside . The shocking video captured the heartbreaking moment Jerry was run over by a 20-ton bus. In . the footage, the teen is seen sprinting to stop the bus as the vehicle . begins to move away from the curb. But the boy's arm gets caught in the . automatic doors, and the driver, who is distracted chatting to other . passengers, drags him along the road for a number of seconds and then . underneath the bus. According to the Sun Sentinel, the . tragedy took place at around 9 a.m. on May 10 in front of scores of . horrified passengers, and was filmed by the Broward County Transit bus's . security cameras, which cover eight angles. Two . of the angles captured the young boy as he gallantly ran towards the . bus for his mother. After he gets his arm caught, he is seen sprinting . for some seven seconds to keep up with the bus while banging on the door . for attention with his other arm. He then disappears out of sight.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:02 EST, 19 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:59 EST, 19 May 2013 . Lord Feldman, the man allegedly behind calling Tory grassroots supporters 'swivel-eyed loons,' has been a loyal presence at David Cameron's side for thirty years. Yet he never gives interviews, has never stood for elected office, and is virtually unknown outside Westminster. But now, it is the sheer strength and longevity of Cameron's friendship with Lord Feldman which makes the furore so damaging for the Tory leader because it is widely assumed their views are shared. Centuries old: Tennis partners: David Cameron (back row, far right) and Andrew Feldman (back row, 2nd left). The pair first established their rapport as students at Brasenose College, Oxford, in the mid-1980s and have remained extremely close since then . The pair first established their rapport . as students at Brasenose College, Oxford, in the mid-1980s and have . remained extremely close since then. Profiles of the peer usually describe the 47-year-old as either as 'Mr Cameron's tennis partner' or 'the PM's oldest . political friend' – fuelling critics' claims that the Government is . being run by  a socially elite clique of old 'chums'. The impression is enhanced by photos of them as young men, posing for the college tennis club team . (the pair are circled, left) and standing next to each other at the . summer ball, which they had helped to organise – Lord Feldman was chairman of . the committee, while Mr Cameron booked the entertainment. Critics: Profiles of the peer usually describe him either as 'Mr Cameron's tennis partner' or 'the PM's oldest political friend' – fuelling critics' claims that the Government is being run by  a socially elite clique of old 'chums' So who is who is Lord Feldman of Elstree, and how has he become so close to the seat of power? Born into a well-off family, he went to Haberdashers’ Aske’s Boys’ School in Hertfordshire, where he won a place to study Law at Oxford. It was at Brasenose College, Oxford, that he met Cameron. They organised a college May ball together and discovered they had a mutual love of racquet sports (another similarity shared between tennis-playing Tony Blair and Lord Levy). Lord Feldman urged Cameron to run for the Tory leadership as the dark horse candidate when Michael Howard announced that he was handing on the baton in 2005 . Since those college days, the friendship has been cemented, with Mr Cameron describing Lord Feldman as ‘one of my oldest and best friends’. Scandal: Feldman's most serious brush with scandal came in 2008 when he was entangled with George Osborne in the 'yachtgate' saga: both Feldman and Shadow Chancellor Osborne were guests on billionaire Oleg Deripaska's yacht Queen K . Like Cameron, Lord Feldman got a First in his final exams; then he took a job with management consultants Bain & Co. before, in 1991, being called to the Bar and practising as a commercial barrister at one of the country’s top chambers. His family owns Jayroma, a multinational textile company making ladies’ clothes, and in 1995, aged 29, he joined the firm, drawing a salary of £900,000 in one year alone. It meant he was able to buy the £3million house in Holland Park, West London, where he lives with his wife Gaby and their three children round the corner from David Cameron’s house in Notting Hill. Tory figures describe Lord Feldman as likeable, friendly, extremely bright and unassuming. He skis regularly, enjoys yoga, and owns another house in Andalusia, southern Spain. It was Lord Feldman who not only urged Mr Cameron to run for the Tory leadership as the dark horse candidate when Michael Howard announced that he was handing on the baton in 2005 after the party’s third successive general election defeat, but also masterminded his campaign. Encouragement: Feldman urged Cameron to run for the Tory leadership as the dark horse candidate when Michael Howard announced that he was handing on the baton in 2005 . Lord Feldman helped run Mr Cameron’s bid with ruthless efficiency, calling in favours from his network of contacts in the business world and raising tens of thousands of pounds in the process. Through his family clothing firm, Lord Feldman himself donated £10,000 to the successful cause. He was appointed deputy treasurer of the party in 2005, and – ironically given the circumstances today – immediately let it be known that he wanted to end the dependency on major donors. ‘He’s not comfortable with individuals giving large amounts. He wants a wider base of people giving smaller amounts,’ said a party official at the time. But even before the Conservatives got into power, Lord Feldman made the wrong call. In 2007, he was chairman of the Leaders’ Club, a dining group for Tory donors who each gave a minimum £50,000 to party funds each year. They would have lunch or dinner in Mr Cameron’s office in the Commons and meet senior Tory politicians. But this arrangement was in breach of Parliament’s rules, which do not allow party-political fundraising in the House of Westminster, and Mr Cameron was forced to ‘unreservedly apologise’ after he was rebuked by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Sir Philip Mawer. In 2008, Lord Feldman was appointed chief executive of the Tory Party and was given specific responsibility for attracting party donors. Until now, Lord Feldman's most serious . brush with scandal came in 2008 when he was entangled with George . Osborne in the 'yachtgate' saga: both Feldman and Shadow Chancellor . Osborne were guests on billionaire Oleg Deripaska's yacht off Corfu when . Mr Osborne was accused of soliciting for a £50,000 donation to the . party – at a time when Feldman had been given responsibility for . 'widening the party's fundraising base'. Donations . from foreign nationals such as Deripaska are illegal and Mr Osborne . insisted neither he nor Lord Feldman had discussed donations with the . Russian, and the storm passed. In . January Lord Feldman said 'I did not know who Mr Deripaska was. I was going . over because I had been invited, and it’s a human weakness I’m afraid . because I was fascinated to see this boat. I had never seen a boat of . that size close up.' Rise: After the Tories entered Government in 2010, Feldman was made co-chairman of the party and later in the year became Baron Feldman of Elstree . After the Tories entered Government . in 2010, he was made co-chairman of the party and later in the year . became Baron Feldman of Elstree. Lord Feldman's . key party roles mean he will have been privy to some of the most . closely guarded secrets of the 'Cameron project' from the outset – no . doubt reinforcing the Prime Minister's feelings of personal loyalty. Lord Feldman's importance to Mr Cameron, . who has publicly described him as 'one of my oldest and best friends', . was emphasised when he was tasked with 'prepping' the PM for his . appearance at the Leveson Inquiry into press standards. He played the role of Robert Jay, the counsel for the inquiry, by . peppering Mr Cameron with likely questions about his relationship with . newspaper owners. Colleagues regard the peer as 'virtually . indispensable' to the Prime Minister. 'He is direct, easy-going and has . an extremely sharp business brain,' says one. 'Plus, he is one of the few people around Cameron who can talk to him on the same level. Cameron values that. It would take a minor earthquake to shift him from his side.' In . 2007, Feldman was chairman of the Leaders' Club, a dining group for . Tory donors who each gave a minimum £50,000 to party funds each year - . they would have lunch or dinner in Mr Cameron's office in the Common . Lord Feldman, one of the Prime Minister's closest friends and political allies, was accused of making the 'swivel-eyed loons' remark to journalists at a London hotel. They reported that an unnamed 'close ally' of the Prime Minister blamed Tory activists for pressuring MPs to take hardline stances on Europe. They said he stated: 'There's really no problem. The MPs just have to do it because the [Tory] associations tell them to, and the associations are all mad, swivel-eyed loons.' But yesterday afternoon, after crisis talks with Mr Cameron, and amid growing claims on Twitter that the unnamed person was Lord Feldman, the peer issued a statement, saying the allegations against him were 'completely untrue' and he was considering legal action. 'I did not, nor have ever, described our associations in this way or in any similar manner. Nor do these alleged comments represent my view of our activists,' he said. 'On the contrary,  I have found them to be hard-working, committed and reasonable people, the backbone of the party.' Mr Cameron fully backed Lord Feldman. A No 10 spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister supports Lord Feldman's position. It is categorically untrue that anyone in Downing Street made the comments reported in The Times and the Telegraph.' Both The Times and The Daily Telegraph stood by their reports. A source at  News International, which owns The Times, said: 'There is no doubt Feldman used the words loons and swivel-eyed.' A titanic trial of strength between No 10 and the two newspapers now seems inevitable. Defeat for Feldman would force him to resign and could inflict potentially catastrophic damage to Mr Cameron.","Pair first established rapport as students at Brasenose College in mid-1980s .

"Adam Purinton, 51, fled the scene of the attack at a pub in Olathe and went to a restaurant where he confided in a staff member, police say.
He was arraigned in court on Monday with first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder.
The accused wore a safety smock to prevent him from harming himself.
Police say he shot and killed Srinivas Kuchibholta at a pub on Wednesday evening.
He allegedly fired on Mr Kuchibhotla and his friend Alok Madasani, two 32-year-old Indian men who worked as engineers at GPS-maker Garmin.
Mr Kuchibhotla died and Mr Madasani survived. A third patron, 24-year-old Ian Grillot, was wounded trying to intervene.
The FBI is investigating whether the shooting constitutes a hate crime.
After the attack at Austins Bar and Grill, the suspect, who is white, drove 70 miles (112km) to an Applebee's in Clinton, Missouri, where he allegedly admitted what he had done to an employee.
On Saturday at 11am, the doors of Austin Bar and Grill reopened, after a fatal shooting which has shaken people here in Olathe and beyond.
""We've come back to show we won't let the attacker change our way of life,"" said one patron who'd turned up.
Austins is your regular local bar in a strip mall. It serves the usual diet of fried food and beers, with sport on big screens. But, Austins is now also the place which robbed one man of his life, and left two others injured.
As Alok Madasani sat in pain in his living room, nursing an injury caused by the bullet which struck his thigh, he told me how he and Srinivas were so well known at the bar the staff knew how much ice they took in their drinks.
Until that fateful night, he said he'd never heard anyone use overtly racist language in Olathe. And many other Indians I met at a vigil on Friday night echoed that sentiment.
They said Olathe has always been a friendly and welcoming place. One man said he hoped this tragedy was a ""one-off"", and that the show of support here would help heal the many hearts, which have been broken.
In a 911 call, a bartender, Sam Suida, told the police dispatcher a man had come into the bar and said he'd done something ""really bad"" and that he was on the run.
""He asked if he could stay with me and my husband, and he wouldn't tell me what he did,"" she says on a recording of the call.
""I kept asking him, and he said that he would tell me if I agreed to let him stay with me.
""Well, I finally got him to tell me and he said, like, that he shot and killed two Iranian people in Olathe.""
The shooting drew worldwide attention and has gripped the Indian-American community.
Hillary Clinton weighed in on the matter on Twitter on Monday, demanding President Donald Trump speak out against intolerance following the shooting.
""With threats & hate crimes on rise, we shouldn't have to tell @POTUS to do his part. He must step up & speak out,"" the former Democratic presidential candidate tweeted.
Mr Trump has yet to comment, but his press secretary, Sean Spicer, said on Monday that early reports on the Kansas shooting were ""disturbing"".
Witnesses said the suspect shouted ""get out of my country"" before shots rang out.
Mr Madasani told the BBC the gunman had demanded to know if they were in the country legally.
The suspect is being held in the Johnson County Jail on a bond of $2m (Â£1.6m).
His next court appearance is on 9 March.","A man arrested last week for shooting two Indians at a Kansas bar allegedly told a barmaid he had just opened fire on some ""Iranian people""."

 Cash Hyde Foundation Video 
  
 Cash Michael Hyde 
  
  
  
 2008 - 2012 
  
 When Cashy was 20 months old Radiologist’s at Community Medical Center in Missoula, MT. Discovered a 4.5 cm. Stage 4 Brain Tumor in Cashy. He was transported on Life Flight to Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City, UT. Cashy was placed on the 2nd floor NTU intensive care unit. 
  
 Cashy went into emergency open brain surgery the following day to try and remove the tumor. The surgeon’s only removed 10% of the tumor for biopsy because it had grown around his optic nerves. After the surgery Cashy lost his eyesight from the pressure of the tumor on his optic nerves. 
  
 Oncologist’s diagnosed Cashy with a Malignant and Aggressive Cancer classified as a PNET Brain Tumor. PNET’s are part of the Blue Cell Cancer group that our aggressive and have a high fatality rate. The Oncologist recommended that Cashy receive 3cycles of Chemotherapy followed by 3 cycles of High Dose Chemotherapy with Stem Cell Rescue. This protocol is aggressive and will take 6 to 8 months to complete. 
  
 We were told that we needed to do the treatment at Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City, UT and that Cashy would have to stay in the hospital for weeks at a time. We returned home to Missoula for 6 days to pack are basic belongings and prepare ourselves for the Battle of a Lifetime! 
  
  
  
 There are no words to describe watching chemotherapy take effect on someone you love. Chemotherapy kills cancer cells very aggressively unfortunately it kills healthy cells the same. If cancer has ever touched your life or the life of someone you know, I don’t have to tell you how devastating it is. 
  
 From the day Cashy’s tumor was discovered he has marveled the medical profession and defied odds countless times. Cashy is considered a Miracle to thousands of people around the world and many Doctors and Nurses. Along the way Cashy regained his vision, survived seizures, and many PICU emergencies. There were many ups and downs along the way but each day Cashy would fight with a smile earning him the title “THE BOY OF STEEL.” 
  
 Unfortunately on October-12-2011 the Hyde’s were told that Cashy’s brain tumor was back and that he must begin Proton Beam Radiation at the Loma Linda University in California. With radiation treatment Cash has a 30% chance of 5 year survival and risk of Leukemia Cancer, Blindness and severe Brain damage. 
  
 In June 2012, we drove from Missoula, MT to San Francisco, CA so Mike could speak at the High Time Cannabis Cup. We also had a booth for the foundation to spread Cashy's story and pediatric cancer awareness. It was also Cashy's fourth birthday and we had a blast going to the beach, the science museum, we drove through the Redwood forest and rode the gondola up the mountain to see some really huge trees! 
  
  
  
 While we were in San Francisco, we teamed up with United Patients Group and they donated/helped assemble and sticker 10 reggae runners to children’s hospitals in the bay area. 
  
 During our trip to San Francisco, Cashy had started throwing up and acting more tired than usual. He continued to complain about a pain in his lower abdomen, sometimes he would scream it would hurt him so bad. We had several tests done to rule out different things it could have been; radiation enteritis, tumors in his abdomen, blockage or constipation. He had CT scans done with barium enema studies, he had ultrasounds, lab tests, and all the tests came back negative. After two more weeks and his condition only worsening, we did what we feared the most and ordered an early brain MRI even though he had been cancer free at the end of May. 
  
 July 27th, 2012 Cashy’s MRI revealed a 2.7cm brain tumor in the same location as the previous two tumors. We were devastated but we’re hopeful that we would be able to save him with a natural treatment plan using cannabis oil, the Gerson Therapy and other immune boosting remedies. We had exhausted our options with chemotherapy and radiation as he had went through and received all the heavy hitter chemo drugs and the top notch radiation therapy offered. We made the decision that we wouldn’t put him through any of that ever again. No more brain scans, no more IV’s, no more Ports, no more Central Lines, Lab tests or hearing and kidney tests and most importantly “No More Pokes,” as Cashy had asked. We honored his request even though we knew what the outcome would likely be. 
  
 Cashy Fought hard for five more months, he never received one more poke, like we had promised. He never set foot in the hospital ever again. Cashy passed away November 14th, 2012 in the arms of his daddy while wearing a pair of his favorite monkey pajamas. He forever changed our family and many lives of others who have followed his amazing journey. Cashy’s legacy will live on for years and years to come. He will never be forgotten. 
  
 Fundraisers & Donations 
  
  
  
  
  
 This Battle would not have been possible without the financial support we received from the fundraisers & donations that were put together by family, friends and strangers all across Montana, and other States thanks to Cashy’s Facebook friends. We were able to leave work for 9 months and concentrate on helping Cashy fight Cancer as a Family. We were able to be at the hospital 24hrs a day and Cashy never had to be alone. We are very thankful for all that everyone has done. 
  
 Camp Cashy 
  
 Since Salt Lake City is 500 miles from our home in Missoula we brought down the family camp trailer and camped out at Primary Children’s Hospital for 9 months. We were very fortunate to have it considering some families sleep on the floor and in the waiting rooms. It was nice to get out of the hospital and take a break. We called it Camp Cashy and it was our piece of Montana in Utah. 
  
 Big Brother Colten 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 Big Brother Colten is the Rock of our family and played a great role in this battle. Colten can make anyone smile and loves flirting with nurses, so I guess you could say he was in his element at Primary Children’s. Kalli and I would switch each day and one of us would take Colten and go swimming or just hang out. Colten made us keep our spirits up and stay positive. 
  
  ||||| Doctors said 2-year-old Cash Hyde would likely die after they found a stage 4 brain tumor surrounding his optic nerve just a year ago this week. 
  
 And he nearly did. After being subjected to seven different chemotherapy drugs, the little boy from Missoula, Montana suffered septic shock, a stroke and pulmonary hemorrhaging. 
  
 Cash was so sick he went 40 days without eating. His organs were threatening to shut down. His father, Mike Hyde, intervened, slipping cannabis oil into his son's feeding tube. 
  
 In Montana, medical marijuana is legal. Hyde had used it himself to treat his attention deficit disorder. When Cash was diagnosed in May 2010, Mike got him a marijuana card and purchased the drug from his own supplier. 
  
 Cash, now 3, made a miraculous recovery at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, but his father's bold action -- taken behind doctors' backs -- has raised serious questions about a parent's role in medical treatment. 
  
 Hyde said he believes it was the marijuana oil that helped Cash eat again and that the drug -- illegal in most states, including Utah, can cure cancer. 
  
 ""Not only was it helpful,"" Hyde, 27, told ABCNews.com. ""It was a godsend."" 
  
 Dr. Linda Granowetter, a professor of pediatrics at New York University and chief of the Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, told ABCNews.com that Hyde's intervention was ""fascinating"" but ""somewhat bothersome."" 
  
 Granowetter said she agrees that cannabis -- the chemical form, THC can be found in the prescription drug Marinol -- is effective in treating adult nausea that accompanies chemotherapy. But there have been no clinical trials in children. 
  
 ""Its virtue is we know exactly what you are getting and how much,"" she said. ""I think that the fact that he didn't have the rapport and ability to be honest with the doctor is very troubling. Care is impeded when there is not complete trust."" 
  
 Hyde, who quit his job as a car salesman when Cash was diagnosed with cancer, said he was afraid Cash's doctor might take the marijuana away. 
  
 ""When you are told your kid has cancer, whoa,"" said Hyde, 27. ""Then they tell me they have to do aggressive chemo and he's probably not going to make it. It's a lot to take on."" 
  
 He had read claims by researchers online about cannabis's properties: ""It's one of the best nausea and pain medications on the market,"" he said. 
  
 Because there are no pediatric oncology facilities in rural Montana, where Cash's tumor was discovered in a CT scan at the local emergency room, he was rushed to Salt Lake City, the nearest treatment center. 
  
 He was given the highest possible doses of chemotherapy for two months. He lost his appetite and threw up eight to 10 times a day. 
  
 ""When he started the chemo, he was so sick,"" said Hyde. ""For the first six weeks, he was blind. But his tumor was shrinking… It's the nastiest thing to see someone you love go through this."" 
  
 Doctors had inserted a gastric feeding tube to administer cancer-fighting drugs and to help with his nutrition, but when August came the family experienced another medical ""rollercoaster ride,"" according to Hyde. 
  
 ""The G-tube burned out the inside of his stomach,"" said Hyde. ""He didn't even have the will to eat."" 
  
 By September, Cash had stopped eating for 40 days. ""He was suffering terribly, and the doctors said it was the best they could do for him,"" said Hyde, who asked doctors to stop the chemotherapy drugs. 
  
 Instead, Hyde boiled up marijuana he had purchased in Montana with olive oil and measured 3 mm. doses that he poured into his son's G-tube twice a day. 
  
 Because it was illegal to use medical marijuana in Utah, Hyde never told his doctors. 
  
 Cash Hyde Makes 'Miracle' Recovery' 
  
 ""In two weeks he was weaned of all the nausea drugs, and he was eating again and sitting up in and laughing,"" according to Hyde, who said doctors called his son's recovery ""a miracle."" 
  
 NYU's Granowetter said cannabis ""certainly can increase appetite and improve mood...but the idea that it can cure cancer is ludicrous."" 
  
 She said the drug is most effective in teens who have previously used marijuana. ""In young adults or children who have not had it before, it can make them paranoid."" 
  
 ""It's awfully hard to gauge if a child would have a bad reaction,"" according to Granowetter, who said she would welcome clinical trials on children. 
  
 ""We know from research that 30 to 60 percent of parents with children are giving them alternative meds like vitamins, shark tooth and herbs from Chinatown,"" she said.

 Mike Hyde said he did eventually tell the Utah doctors, who were surprised by how Cash bounced back with no permanent organ damage. They say the boy has a 50 to 80 percent chance that the cancer will come back, according to Hyde, who has since started a foundation to help children with cancer. 
  
 ""We were told I was one of the best dads,"" said Hyde, who lived with his wife and their other 6-year-old son in a camper in a parking lot for the nine months of treatment. ""Every encounter in Salt Lake City, we were positive and never quit fighting. I was told he was going to die, but I knew he hadn't stopped the fight.""

"The Burrell Collection will shut on Sunday evening and will reopen in 2020 after the multi-million pound redevelopment is complete.
This weekend the museum is hosting a range of free activities including live music, a family ceilidh, and guided tours.
The building is said to be no longer fit for purpose and needs a new roof.
The Burrell Collection, in the heart of Pollok Country Park, opened to the public in 1983.
Only a fifth of the collection, donated to the city by collector Sir William Burrell in 1944, is currently on display as many items have had to be removed to protect them from damage.
It is estimated that the total cost of the project will be between £60m and £66m.
Under the modernisation plans, a new roof and high performance glazing will make the museum more energy-efficient.
Two new floors of exhibition space will be created so that 90% of the 8,000 objects can be viewed by the public.
Throughout the Burrell's refurbishment, some of the works from its collection will be on display at Kelvingrove Museum and Art Gallery in Glasgow.
Burrell at Kelvingrove will showcase a series of changing displays, providing visitors continued access to treasures from the collection.
The first exhibition 'Burrell at Kelvingrove: Joseph Crawhall', will offer visitors a rare opportunity to see 23 of the finest works by one of the radical group of young Scottish painters, the Glasgow Boys. It will run from 24 October, 2016 until July next year.",One of Glasgow's museums is preparing to close its doors for four years as a major refurbishment begins.
"Relying on historical records and accounts from old timers, AL.com may have located the long-lost wreck of the Clotilda, the last slave ship to bring human cargo to the United States. 
  
 What's left of the ship lies partially buried in mud alongside an island in the lower Mobile-Tensaw Delta, a few miles north of the city of Mobile. The hull is tipped to the port side, which appears almost completely buried in mud. The entire length of the starboard side, however, is almost fully exposed. The wreck, which is normally underwater, was exposed during extreme low tides brought on by the same weather system that brought the ""Bomb Cyclone"" to the Eastern Seaboard. Low tide around Mobile was about two and a half feet below normal thanks to north winds that blew for days. 
  
 ""I'm quaking with excitement. This would be a story of world historical significance, if this is the Clotilda,"" said John Sledge, a senior historian with Mobile Historical Commission, and author of The Mobile River, an exhaustive history of the river. ""It's certainly in the right vicinity... We always knew it should be right around there."" 
  
 This reporter, Ben Raines, used the abnormally low tides to search for the ship after researching possible locations. The remote spot where the ship was found, deep in the swampy Mobile-Tensaw Delta, is accessible only by boat. During my first trips after discovering the wreck, I documented it with photographs and aerials shot with a drone. Over the next week, I ferried a shipwright expert in the construction techniques used on old wooden vessels and a team of archaeologists from the University of West Florida to the site. 
  
 All concluded that the wreck dated to the mid 1800s (the Clotilda was built in 1855), and featured construction techniques typical of Gulf Coast schooners used to haul lumber and other heavy cargo, as the Clotilda was designed to do. The vessel also bore telltale signs of being burned, as the Clotilda reportedly was. In later years, the slavers bragged of burning the ship at the conclusion of their voyage in July of 1860 in an effort to hide proof of their human trafficking. Evidence of a fire on the wreck included a distinctive patina on wrought iron chain plates used to hold the masts and bowsprit in place, and charred beams and timbers in the ship's interior. 
  
 ""These ships were the 18-wheelers of their day. They were designed to haul a huge amount of cargo in relatively shallow water,"" said Winthrop Turner, a shipwright specializing in wooden vessels. ""That's why you see the exceptional number of big iron drifts used to hold the planking together. That's also why the sides of the ship are so stout. They are almost two feet thick. The construction techniques here, no threaded bolts, iron drifts, butt jointed planking, these all confirm a ship built between 1850 and 1880."" 
  
 The team of University of West Florida archaeologists, led by Greg Cook and John Bratten, agreed. The men have made a career of exploring shipwrecks, including Spanish galleons sunk in Pensacola Bay in 1559 and slave ships sunk off the coast of Africa. They were contacted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration several years ago about searching for the Clotilda, but nothing ever came of the plan. After examining the aerials, images and historical documents I had assembled, the archaeologists visited the wreck on a chilly morning, temperatures just above freezing.

 ""You can definitely say maybe, and maybe even a little bit stronger, because the location is right, the construction seems to be right, from the proper time period, it appears to be burnt. So I'd say very compelling, for sure,"" said Cook. 
  
 ""There is nothing here to say this isn't the Clotilda, and several things that say it might be,"" Bratten concurred, adding that several bits of evidence assembled by AL.com make a strong case for further exploration. 
  
 So far, the investigation is only visual, with no attempts made to dig up the hull or remove artifacts. Alabama laws governing ship wrecks carry stiff penalties, including the confiscation of boats and other equipment, for disturbing shipwrecks or military battlefields without permits. 
  
 One of the key elements that suggests this may be the Clotilda comes from the location where it was found. The ship lies essentially where its captain, William Foster, said he burned and sank it in 1860. 
  
 Even so, the archaeologists stressed, a conclusive determination can only be made by documenting any artifacts that remain in the hold, if such a determination can even be made. So far, the scientists have only examined the parts of the ship that can be seen above the mud that encases most of the hull. Turner, the shipwright, estimated that the bottom of the ship may be as deep as ten feet down in the mud, based on certain parts of the ship that are visible above the mud. Digging into the past will require both federal and state permits, and a lot of money. 
  
 A crime and a mystery 
  
 The Clotilda is the last ship known to have brought slaves into the country. The hunt for the ship has inspired numerous searchers over the years, but the Clotilda has long escaped discovery, until perhaps now. A small clarification for those familiar with the tale, the ship's name is the Clotilda, not the Clotilde. Newspaper accounts beginning in 1860 misspelled the name, and over the years it stuck. But the ship's license and the captain's journal make clear that Clotilda is correct. 
  
 A couple of details in the historical record may have helped keep the ship hidden for so long, mainly by sending would-be explorers looking in the wrong place, or leading them to disregard this wreck as a possible candidate. Those items will be discussed in greater detail below. 
  
 From the start, the fate of the Clotilda was designed to remain a mystery, with the slavers attempting to destroy the ship after delivering 110 captives from ""the Kingdom of Dahomey,"" which is modern day Benin, Africa, in 1860. Though slavery was still legal in the U.S. at the time, it had been illegal to import slaves into the country for 52 years, since Thomas Jefferson signed an 1808 law forbidding the practice. 
  
 With the nation edging closer to civil war over the slavery issue, Alabama steamboat captain and plantation owner Timothy Meaher made an infamous bet that he could sneak slaves into the country, right under the noses of federal troops at the twin forts that guarded the mouth of Mobile Bay. Historian Sylvianne Diouf traced the evolution of the wicked scheme and the resulting journey in her excellent book, Dreams of Africa in Alabama, published in 2007. Attempts to contact Diouf were unsuccessful. 
  
 The book primarily focuses on the story of the captives, who were freed just five years after they were enslaved, thanks to the end of the Civil War. The group, 110 strong, originally asked their captor, Meaher, to pay for passage back to Africa. After he refused, they appealed to the U.S. government, again to no avail. Ultimately, some members of the group bought a small piece of land north of Mobile from Meaher and created a community called Africatown, where some of the descendants of the original slaves still live. They spoke their native tongue, farmed using traditional African methods, and ran their own school. 
  
 Descendants of those brought to this country aboard the Clotilda are believed to be the only group of slave descendants who know precisely where their ancestors came from, when they arrived, and what vessel brought them here. 
  
 Africatown was added to the national historic register in 2012. The last of those brought from Africa, Cudjo Lewis, died in 1935, but not before experiencing a small bit of celebrity. Diouf's book relies in part on interviews with Cudjo made before his death. 
  
 Several -- but not all -- of the clues needed to find the ship were in the book. 
  
 In the end, this ship was found where the Clotilda's captain, William Foster, stated that he set it on fire in his journal. Neither Foster or Meaher were ever convicted of the crime of slaving, though Meaher was arrested at one point for his role, and Foster was forced to pay a $1,000 fine for failing to register in port after an international trip. The disruption of the Civil War meant that the case against the men was abandoned. 
  
 The Journey 
  
 Thirty years later, Meaher was quoted extensively in a newspaper article in 1890 bragging about how they had smuggled their captives into the country. A state park on the edge of the Mobile-Tensaw Delta, about eight miles from where the ship was found, is named for Meaher's family, which donated the land and remains prominent in Mobile. In fact, I left from a boat ramp in Meaher State Park on my trips to find and explore the wreck of the ship the park's namesake may have sent to win his wretched bet. 
  
 Meaher, the mastermind behind the scheme, was already a rich man, with a plantation and a steamboat that he captained up and down the Alabama River. He set out to bring slaves in for no reason other than to prove that he could do it. 
  
 He purchased the Clotilda, a two-masted schooner, for $35,000 and hired Captain William Foster to sail to Africa, purchase 100 slaves with about $9,000 in gold, and bring them back to Alabama. The ship's true mission was disguised by stops in Caribbean ports. The supplies needed to feed the captives on the return journey were carefully hidden beneath piles of lumber, to avoid discovery should the Clotilda be boarded by British, Dutch, or Portugese military vessels during the crossing. That lumber would later be used to build pens to house the captives. 
  
 Foster's journal and insurance documents from the 1800s, maintained in the Mobile Public Library, provide a detailed account of the voyage beginning with a list of how many casks of rice, rum, molasses, beef, water, and other supplies were laid on to feed 110 captives on a return voyage. Written in the flowery language of the Victorian era, Foster's account has him ""sallying forth"" to meet with African slave traders. During the four-month journey, the Clotilda survived a collision with a Portuguese Man-O-War ship that had given chase, mutiny by the crew, and a storm that ripped a mast from the ship. The tale ends with the arrival back in Alabama waters, the tricks used to smuggle the prisoners past port officials in Mobile, and finally the burning of the ship after the captives were hidden in a swamp. 
  
 Even as the men plotted the sinister voyage, they understood that the chances of discovery were high, and the price of being caught violating the federal slaving law could be death. They arranged to bring the ship to shore far from Mobile, at Point Aux Pins, a desolate stretch of shoreline along the Mississippi Sound. Upon successful completion of the voyage, Foster was to send word to Meaher, who would dispatch a steam tug from Mobile to tow the large sailing ship upriver to offload the slaves at Meaher's plantation. 
  
 But by the time the ship returned to Alabama, Meaher knew the scheme had been found out and worried federal officials might be lying in wait. The original plan had been for Foster to unload the slaves and then sail to Mexico, where the ship would be cleaned, and then disguised with new rigging, license papers and a new name. Instead, with the crew threatening another mutiny, Foster and Meaher agreed to burn the ship. It was, they decided, the only way to hide the telltale signs of human trafficking visible in the hold. 
  
 Diouf, relying on historical accounts, imagines the scene this way, ""He knew - and Meaher did too - that they might have been spotted, so they had decided to destroy the evidence, the telling signs of a slaving voyage: the partitions, the platforms, the empty casks of food and water, the big pots, the tubs, the blood, the vomit, the spit, the mucus, the urine, and the feces that soiled the planks, the awful smell that always floated around slave ships."" 
  
 Location, Location, Location 
  
 One of the most definitive pieces of evidence that this wreck might be the Clotilda is its location, adjacent to the island where the captives were reportedly transferred to another boat. The details I used to pinpoint the wreck come from three men -- their lives separated by more than 100 years -- one of whom I interviewed. 
  
 Russell Ladd has been travelling the Delta rivers since he was a boy. His family is one of Mobile's oldest, specializing in insurance for shippers. A large stadium in Mobile is named after Ladd's ancestors. Ladd still maintains the family's remote camp on Chuckfee Bay, accessible only by boat. His grandfather, born in 1881, bought the land. The camp is located in the interior of the Delta, less than a mile from where the ship was found. I called Ladd in October to tell him I was hunting for the Clotilda and asked if he might have an idea where the wreck might be. 
  
 ""I think I do,"" Ladd said, before describing a fairly precise location to me. He described a spot I've been by many times, in an area where I often fish but have never noticed a wreck. When I asked why he thought it was there, he said, ""Well, when I was a boy, we used to go up the Mobile River to fish various places. On low tide, we'd see this burned out ship and my father and his friends would say, 'There's the Clotilda.'"" 
  
 Ladd said the boat house where the family's boat was kept was on Bayou Sara, which flows into the Mobile River alongside 12 Mile Island, ""so we traversed 12 Mile Island quite a bit. The whole delta was full of old gravel barges, wooden barges, that were in various states of deterioration. They used to just abandon those everywhere. But those were rectangular. I don't know of any other ships like this one, where it comes to a point. I always questioned Daddy about it."" 
  
 Ladd's father, born in 1907, and his grandfather, born in 1881, both fished and duck hunted in the Delta. While Ladd offered the location where the ship was found in our initial interview, he later said he was never sure if his father really knew or was just telling an inquisitive kid what he wanted to hear. 
  
 At the dawn of the 20th century, the location of the wreck appeared to be an open secret locally, although records I've reviewed from others who hunted the ship reveal there were more than a half dozen wrecks people insisted were the Clotilda. Photos of some of those wrecks from the early 1900s make clear they could not be the Clotilda for various reasons. And none of the wrecks in those records were located where this ship was found. (Similarly, none of the other wrecks are located where the captain said he burned the ship, as this wreck is.) 
  
 In her book, Diouf writes ""A man was posted near the burning vessel to make sure pieces of the wreckage did not float down the river, a definite sign that something shady had been going on. But it was a futile exercise because her hull remained visible at low tide for three quarters of a century."" 
  
 The survival of a significant portion of the hull is not unusual, as ships will only burn down to the waterline. Over time, the portion of the ship that had been visible on a normal low tide, particularly the ribs, surely rotted away, due to exposure to the elements. However, sections that remain continually underwater, or better still, buried beneath a layer of mud, could be expected to survive centuries, especially with the old growth longleaf pine used to construct the Clotilda and other ships built in Mobile in the 1800s. 
  
 Ladd said it had been many years since he had been able to see the wreck. But Diouf's 75-year span where the burned husk was regularly visible dovetails nicely with Ladd's recollection of seeing the ship when he was a boy. 
  
 The second part of the location evidence comes from the accounts of Capt. Foster and Timothy Meaher. In his journal, hand-written in a tight and slanted cursive, Foster describes towing the Clotilda into the Delta under cover of night by way of the Spanish River, so as to avoid detection in the port of Mobile. The Delta is a vast wetland, about 13 miles wide, and divided by dozens of rivers, creeks, bayous and islands. Using Spanish River meant the Clotilda traveled up the east side of two islands, Pinto and Blakeley, and allowed Foster to bypass the downtown waterfront, which was already heavily populated in the 1850s. 
  
 ""I towed the Clotilda into Mobile Bay and up to 12 Mile Island and transferred the (captives) to a river steamboat the Czar and then I burned her and sunk her in 20 feet of water,"" reads Foster's testimony, suggesting he burned the ship next to 12 Mile Island, which is precisely where I found it. 
  
 For his part, Meaher, in a newspaper interview 30 years later, added the detail that the ship was towed into ""Bayou Connor"" and burned. For several reasons, I don't think this was true, though I think Meaher might have believed it was. It's also possible this was another effort by Meaher to hide the location of the ship. 
  
 The reference confused me at first because I didn't recognize the bayou's name. I earn part of my living as a nature guide, taking sightseers and fishermen into the Mobile-Tensaw Delta aboard my boat. I know the rivers and bayous well, but had never encountered a ""Bayou Connor."" It was only when I began searching through old maps that it made sense. There, on a map made in 1889, is Bayou Connor, branching off from Bayou Canot, just across from the tip of 12-Mile Island. Today, the whole area is known as Bayou Canot. The confluence of Bayou Canot and the Mobile River occurs directly above the northern tip of 12 Mile Island. The geography of the rivers coming together makes a big X on the map, with the apparent continuation of Bayou Canot wrapping around the east side of 12 Mile Island while the main channel of the Mobile River wraps around the west side. 
  
 It is possible that Meaher meant this lower section around 12 Mile Island, though technically, both sides of 12 Mile Island are considered to be the Mobile River, and Bayou Canot (then called Bayou Connor) meets its end at the confluence with the river just above the island, all things a steamboat captain such as Meaher would have known. 
  
 I think a more likely scenario is that Meaher told Foster to move the ship off the main river into Bayou Canot and burn it, but then left aboard his brother's steamboat with all of the Clotilda's crew before the fire was lit. I suspect Foster, left behind with all the evidence of their crime, might have decided to burn the ship right then and there, in what was already a pretty secluded spot, rather than spend another hour taking the ship deeper into the swamp. 
  
 The three primary documents for investigating this affair are Foster's 13-page description of the entire journey, the newspaper article about Meaher written 30 years later, and a handwritten document that may be the reporter's notes for the Meaher article. Those sources differ on the critical detail of where the ship was burned, though they agree that it was Foster who did the burning. 
  
 We also know Meaher most likely wasn't around when the ship was burned thanks to his braggadocio in the 1890 newspaper article. There, he spins the story of how he crafted an alibi for his whereabouts during the days long affair of retrieving the Clotilda and transferring the slaves to his brother's steamboat. 
  
 The breathless newspaper article begins by crediting Meaher's ""desperate but successful undertaking"" with creating the ""only full-blood African colony in America,"" referring to Africatown, which had been established decades prior. The tale comes from ""the venerable captain, from whose lips was learned the story of the importation of the last cargo of slaves in the South."" 
  
 It describes Meaher's alibi plot this way: ""His brother, the late Capt. Burns Meaher, who at that time commanded the steamboat the Czar, was instructed to fire up and proceed to the mouth of the Spanish River, which debouches into Mobile Bay about four or five miles east of this city, and there await the Clotilda's arrival. Capt. Meaher also issued orders that supper must not be served on the packet Roger B. Taney on her trip to Montgomery the following Tuesday night, until he boarded the boat at some point up the Alabama River."" 
  
 Meaher was the captain of the Roger B. Taney. He ordered the ship to leave Mobile without him for its weekly run upriver, planning to sneak aboard after the slave transfer had taken place, which he did. Getting back to the Taney quickly was key to making his alibi work. 
  
 The newspaper article continues: ""Under cover of night, Capt. Meaher and the Clotilda's crew were transferred to the Taney. The crew of the slaver were stowed away in an upper portion of the boat, locked in, and supplied with cards and whisky. It was 9:30 before supper was announced on the Taney that night, and when the captain took his seat at the head of the table his face wore a most nonchalant appearance, and gave forth not the slightest intimation that he had been engaged in other than the legitimate performance of his duties."" 
  
 Based apparently on the newspaper article and the handwritten notes mentioned above, a Mobile area man named Jack Friend spent thousands of dollars searching for the Clotilda in Bayou Canot in the late 1990s. Though Friend is now dead, I spent a day reviewing his extensive collection of papers related to the Clotilda and other shipwrecks in the History Museum of Mobile with historian John Sledge. Employing a salvage company, side scan sonar, magnetometers, and divers, the team searched the length of Bayou Canot and came up empty. They did not, however, search the area where I found this wreck, though it was just a mile downstream from the area they did search. 
  
 This same area was left off of an extensive study of Mobile Bay ship wrecks conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1983. That study included the lower Delta, but stopped about four miles south of the area where the wreck I found lies. 
  
 Combining it all together, we have Ladd's reminiscence, which led me to the wreck of a large burned ship from the mid-1800s. That wreck, in turn, is located next to the island where Foster recounts unloading the slaves and scuttling the ship, and across the river from the bayou where Meaher says the ship was torched. 
  
 ""Even if the ship was actually burned in Bayou Canot, it wouldn't surprise me that her rope had parted during the fire and she drifted out into the main channel and washed up where you found it,"" said Sledge, the Mobile historian. ""It is not very far, and it is downstream."" 
  
 Ship length 
  
 While there are no pictures of the Clotilda, we do have measurements for its length and width. The ship was listed as 86 feet long, with a beam (or width) of 23 feet. With the keel line visible in the mud around the wreck, we were able to get a good measurement of the beam of the ship. It fit perfectly, at 23 feet and identical to the beam of the Clotilda. 
  
 But the length was dramatically different. In fact, in my initial visit, I measured the wreck at 124 feet, including a section of the stern visible in the water. I suspect this measurement may have encouraged other people hunting for the Clotilda to disregard this wreck as a possible suspect if they encountered it. Initially, it dissuaded me, as it appeared far too long to be the Clotilda. 
  
 But as I sat on the bow of the ship staring toward the stern, I couldn't imagine how a vessel any smaller could have carried 110 captives and a crew of 14, plus supplies, on a four-month journey across the Atlantic Ocean. A schooner-style vessel that was 40 feet shorter than the wreck I was looking at simply would have been too small. 
  
 So, I began researching how ships were measured in the 1800s. As it turns out, there were three critical measurements for sailing ships. There is the overall length, which is the first thing most people think of today when talking about the size of a boat. But the overall length is actually irrelevant when calculating how much cargo a given ship could hold, as only the portion of the ship sitting in the water supports the weight of the cargo. 
  
 For old sailing ships, there were often two other measurements given: The length along the waterline, and something called ""the Length Between Perpendiculars."" These latter two measurements are designed to account for the fact that old sailing ships often had raked bows and sterns, meaning the ends of the vessel were slanted, with a portion of the front and back of the ship hanging over the water. These numbers were the most important to shippers in the 1800s, not the overall length. 
  
 The Length Between Perpendiculars, was a measurement from the front edge of the rudder forward to the base of the ship's stem in the bow. This measurement, as opposed to the overall length, gave people in the shipping industry a good estimate of how much cargo a given vessel could carry. 
  
 Armed with that knowledge, I began looking up the ""Length Between Perpendiculars"" for various two-masted schooners from the mid 1800s. I found numerous examples of vessels with a Length Between Perpendiculars - or sometimes a waterline measurement - of 80 to 90 feet, and an overall length of 120 to 140 feet. Perhaps the most famous example would be the reconstruction of the slave ship Amistad, subject of a movie about slaves taking over a ship starring Morgan Freeman. 
  
 The Amistad was 23 feet wide, exactly the beam of the Clotilda. The Amistad's overall length was 129 feet, while it's waterline measurement was 78 feet. These numbers match quite closely with the Clotilda, if we assume the 86-foot length was actually a waterline or Length Between Perpendiculars measurement. I found records for about a dozen schooners with measurements closely matching the Amistad and the Clotilda. 
  
 Next steps 
  
 ""With the evidence in the stem, we can get an idea of preservation. With those chain plates, we can get some indication of mast placement. It appears to be a schooner,"" said Cook, the archaeologist. ""If it turns out to be the last slaver, it is going to be a very powerful site for many reasons. The structure of the vessel itself is not as important as its history, and the impact it is going to have on many, many people."" 
  
 Cook said the first step is to gather input from the Alabama Historical Commission, state officials, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Then, he said, preliminary excavations and other tests by archaeological teams would be appropriate. Ultimately, the goal would be to identify the wreck, and then perhaps put the contents on display. 
  
 My friend, outdoors writer Jeff Dute, first suggested we look for the ship, knowing many others had tried. He visited the wreck with me the day Turner, the shipwright, explored it. Dute said that once he had seen the ship, his overall feeling was a profound sadness. 
  
 ""Just imagine what this trip meant for those people. Ripped from their homes, their country, then months in the hold of this ship, right here,"" Dute said. ""That last voyage of the Clotilda is a horrible thing to contemplate. I just keep imagining, crossing the ocean, then getting dumped out here in this swamp while the ship that brought you here went up in a giant conflagration. How terrified they must have been."" 
  
 For my part, I think finding the Clotilda would be a fitting capstone for both Mobile's slaving history and the war that finally ended the practice. Mobile was a big port, even in the 1800s, with a big slave trade. A historical marker on a downtown street marks the site of the old slave market. And just a few miles away, on the east side of the Mobile-Tensaw Delta, lies the site of the Battle of Blakeley, the last battle of the Civil War, fought five years after the Clotilda was burned. It is easy, standing in the wintertime gloom of these Alabama swamps, to imagine that old ghosts haunt these bayous. Maybe this could help put some of them to rest. 
  
 ""I can't help but think this would be a stunning find. Mauvila and the Clotilda are the crown jewels of Alabama archaeology. In maritime history, this is major. This is an internationally significant discovery, if it is the Clotilda,"" said Sledge, the Mobile historian. ""My main concerns are protecting the wreck from people picking over it. The fact that it is already exposed like that clearly shows it is getting a lot of wear and tear. And, of course, proving that it is actually the right ship. If it is, it will be a beautiful thing to behold. This whole thing is pretty, pretty amazing.""

""It is the only group of people brought into the country through slavery where we know exactly where they were brought in, where they were taken from in Africa, and where they ended up in the United States."" |||||","– Russell Ladd remembers seeing the shipwreck as a boy fishing with his father at low tide. His father told him it was the Clotilda, the last American slave ship, though Ladd wasn't sure he believed him. He might now. Using Ladd's account and historical records, including the journal of Clotilda's captain, AL.com reporter Ben Raines believes he's found the remains of the ship that illegally carried 110 slaves to Mobile County, Ala., from Benin, Africa, in 1860, more than 50 years after the transfer of new slaves was outlawed. According to historian Sylvianne Diouf's book, Dreams of Africa in Alabama, plantation owner Timothy Meaher made a bet that he could sneak slaves into Mobile, and hired Capt. William Foster for the job. When the Clotilda returned to Mobile, the slaves were removed. ""Then I burned her and sunk her in 20 feet of water,"" Foster wrote in his journal. Foster described burning the ship next to 12 Mile Island in the lower Mobile-Tensaw Delta, which is where Raines found a burnt wreck sticking out of the mud ""like a dinosaur backbone"" at extremely low tide, per the Los Angeles Times. Built around the same time as the Clotilda, it's the same width at 23 feet. But though its 124-foot length doesn't line up with what was reported as the Clotilda's 86-foot expanse, Raines believes this figure might instead refer to the distance between the Clotilda's rudder and the base of the bow, as this was used to estimate cargo capacity. ""The location is right, the construction seems to be right, from the proper time period, it appears to be burnt. So I'd say very compelling,"" says archaeologist Greg Cook. Raines hopes an excavation will confirm his theory, but notes that permits ""and a lot of money"" need to be acquired first."

"She's one of the most polished A-listers in Tinseltown so it comes as little surprise that Victoria Beckham is passing on her beautifying tips to daughter Harper. The fashion designer has revealed that she and her three-year-old often have 'nail afternoons' - and they're not the only members of the family to enjoy some pampering. Speaking to Vogue magazine, the mother-of-four said: 'I'm very girly and I love nails. Harper and I will often have nail afternoons and when we're in LA, we even send our dog to a nail spa called The Beauty Spot for a paw-pedicure.' Scroll down for video . Perfectly polished: Victoria Beckham, who recently unveiled her collaboration with Nails Inc, has revealed that she and her three-year-old daughter Harper often have 'nail afternoons' The 40-year-old was promoting the new luxury nail polish duo she created in collaboration with Nails Inc. The two limited-edition shades - a warm tomato red and a pale bone hue - are inspired by the designer's yet-to-be unveiled Victoria Victoria Beckham spring/summer 2015 collection. While we saw the main Victoria Beckham collection at New York Fashion Week in September, the new polishes offer us a first hint of what Mrs Beckham has in store for her second fashion line next season. According to a press release, the upcoming VVB collection features subtle nods to Japanese culture, and this is certainly reflected in the nail polish names - Judo Red and Bamboo White. The mother-of-four told Vogue: 'I'm very girly and I love nails. Harper and I will often have nail afternoons and when we're in LA, we even send our dog to a nail spa called The Beauty Spot for a paw-pedicure' Beauty collaboration: Victoria Beckham's nail polish duo with Nails Inc was one of her highs of 2014 . The exclusive formulation of the new nail varnishes features silica-rich bamboo extract, which apparently conditions and feeds the nail bed with essential nutrients. She and Harper both love the orangey red shade. 'I choose it when I'm wearing something uncomplicated, like all black,' she added. The collaboration is a final highlight in what has been a busy - and successful - year for Mrs Beckham. The designer was given the prestigious Best Brand award at the British Fashion Awards 2014. Impeccably manicured Victoria  picked up the Best Brand award at the British Fashion Awards earlier this year . Proving all of her early critics wrong, Victoria Beckham has doubled sales of her fashion business to £30.39million in just two years. The businesswoman reported sales of £15.76million in 2012. And according to The Sun, Victoria Beckham Ltd made a £1.3m profit in 2013 - selling £83,000 worth of stock (or 55 handbags priced at £1,500) per day. The designer, who debuted her first collection of dresses at New York Fashion Week in 2008, has expanded her business to include handbags, shoes, sunglasses, denim, a sister line titled Victoria Victoria Beckham, and even a luxury nail polish collection in collaboration with Nails Inc. The rising sales are thought to be thanks to her recently launched website and her September store opening on Dover Street in Mayfair, London, where hundreds of fans waited in line for the doors to open.

The two women who are suing after they were subjected to a humiliating and invasive cavity search on a Texas roadside on Memorial Day last year have spoken out about their ordeal. Brandy Hamilton, 26, and Alexandria Randle, 24, told reporters how they were ordered out of their vehicle, not permitted to put on clothes to cover the bikinis they'd been wearing at the beach that day, and given cavity searches right by the side of the road.

'I couldn't even imagine if this were to happen to... one of my little cousins... I just want this to be the last time this happens here,' she told KHOU11. Speaking about police searching people for drugs, Brandy Hamilton said, 'If it comes to that, then take the person into jail, you don't have to do it on the side of the road.' 'It's been traumatizing,' she said. 'I don't know if I can trust the cops anymore, it's just been very - a very horrific situation to me.' The women are suing the Texas .

Booker said a third case, that has yet to become public, bears the same hallmarks, as well. 'How are these people behaving in the same manner, hundreds of miles away from each other. There's got to be some factor at the DPS that makes these officers think they can do this,' she said. Trooper Turner has been suspended as part of an internal investigation by the Department of Public Safety .

Ms Hamilton, the driver, asks if she can put her dress on to cover up. 'Don't worry about it. Come out here,' the trooper tells her. Turner . says he can smell marijuana in the car and accuses the women of smoking . and driving. He later claimed that he found a piece of a smoked . marijuana blunt under the back seat of the car. He then makes the two women sand on the side of a busy highway in their swimsuits while he calls for backup. 'One of them has got her zipper open on her pants of her daisy dukes shorts - whatever they are,' the trooper says on the radio. Two more troopers show up - including Jennie Bui. Bui, as trooper Turner explains, 'is going to search you.' 'I ain't, because I ain’t about to get up-close and personal with your woman areas… she is going to put some gloves on,' he says. 'You're going to go up my private parts?' asks Hamilton, sounding bewildered. Despite numerous pleas from the two women not to perform a body cavity search, Bui ignores them. Both women can be seen with pained looks on their faces as the trooper probes their genitals. Both Miss Hamilton (left) and Miss Randel (right) allege their civil rights were violated and they suffered pain and humiliation in the searches . Miss Randle sobs uncontrollably as she is probed.

'If the cavity search alone isn't enough and say it's their fault that you basically just sexually assaulted them - that's humiliating,' she said. Turner later released both women and issued Miss Hamilton a citation fro possession of drug paraphernalia. She is still fighting the charges in court, though she contends the marijuana wasn't hers.

"(CNN) -- A journal written by the 19-year-old gunman in last week's Maryland mall shooting offers no clues to a key question investigators are asking -- whether Darion Aguilar knew the young man and woman he shot and killed before turning the gun on himself. While police in Howard County, Maryland, are not yet releasing the contents of the journal, they said Tuesday that from his writings, it appears Aguilar knew he had mental health issues. They did not elaborate on that point. But why did he go to The Mall in Columbia on Saturday and fire as many as nine shots into a skateboard apparel shop? Gunman's mother says he was 'gentle, sweet' Aguilar was an avid skateboarder, a friend of his family said. As of now, that's the only known link between him and the skate shop Zumiez. Investigators are distributing fliers with Aguilar's picture to those in and around the mall, in hopes of finding people who either knew him or saw him. Aguilar was known to frequent the mall, according to police, where ""he would hang outside and smoke in small groups."" Investigators are also working on retrieving data from Aguilar's computer and cell phone, according to police. Still, his motive remains a mystery. It started out as a routine day in busy mall . Aguilar's mother told reporters Sunday that her son was a ""gentle, sweet kid,"" and that she doesn't think he knew his victims -- 21-year-old Brianna Benlolo and 25-year-old Tyler Johnson. On Saturday, a federal official briefed on the shooting told CNN that preliminary information suggested the gunman aimed only at Benlolo and Johnson, perhaps indicating it was an isolated situation and not a wider shooting spree. ""I know there's a lot of interest in the motive for this, and I have as much interest in that as anybody,"" Howard County Police Chief Bill McMahon said Sunday. Benlolo was an assistant manager at Zumiez. She had worked there since November 2012, according to her Facebook page. Friend Evelyn McDonald said Benlolo, the mother of a small boy, was ""just full of energy."" ""She was so nice and just an amazing artist and just an amazing person inside and out,"" McDonald told CNN. ""She loved her son. She loved being a mother,"" McDonald said. Cops: Mall gunman expressed 'general unhappiness' in journal . Johnson had worked at the store for about three months, according to his Facebook page. Five people went to the hospital for treatment after the shooting. All were treated and released. Four suffered injuries in the chaos after the shooting.

"This past week in Johannesburg there was a funeral I wished I had been able to attend.
Ahmed Kathrada, well-known African National Congress (ANC) activist and South African statesman, was laid to rest. The well-deserved tributes to the man, affectionately known as Kathy, who died at the age of 87 have been delivered.
It was not the politics surrounding the funeral, with President Jacob Zuma being asked to stay away, that was the main attraction for me, even though I must confess I would not have minded being there to hear some of the speeches.
I would simply have liked to be there to be part of an event that would mark the closure for a journey that started for me on 15 October 1989 in the Soweto township.
I was on my first reporting trip to South Africa for the BBC and, after having been denied a visa for more than two years, I was finally granted one after the intervention of the redoubtable anti-apartheid activist Helen Suzman.
As things turned out, it was the perfect time to have arrived in the country.
Elizabeth Ohene:
""I remember Ahmed Kathrada telling me he was trying to get used to being seen as an old man when throughout his political activist days and in prison, he was always 'the young man'.""
A week after I got there, it happened. The long-expected opening of the prisons to let out the leaders of the liberation movements started without any warning.
That was the day, no, the night that Ahmed Kathrada and some of his colleagues were released from jail after 26 years.
I was in Walter Sisulu's home in Soweto when he was brought home in the middle of the night.
Andrew Mlangeni, Elias Motsoaledi and Raymond Mhlaba jailed after the infamous Rivonia trials were also released along with Wilton Mkwayi, one of the leaders of the ANC's armed wing, Oscar Mpetha, the veteran ANC and South African Communist Party leader in the Cape, and Japhta Masemola, a Pan Africanist Congress leader.
Their release was greeted with scenes of wild celebration around the country.
Over the next fortnight, I met and interviewed almost all of them in their homes and thus started my intense relationship with South African politics.
I had no choice, of course, but to follow the journeys of those men from then on.
I remember I had this eerie feeling that they, having survived so many years of prison under difficult conditions, might not last very long in the outside world in South Africa.
In my interview with Raymond Mhlaba, he talked about the difficulties of adjusting to the changed country he and his fellow inmates had been released into.
He made a joke about how ironic it would be if he should survive Robben Island all those years only to be killed trying to cross the road in Port Elizabeth.
Twenty-six years earlier, at the time he went into jail, there were very few cars on the roads he told me.
Jafta Masemola was the first to die in a traffic accident a few months after gaining his freedom.
I watched the funeral of Walter Sisulu on television from Accra and I was relieved he had survived to a grand old age.
I remember Ahmed Kathrada telling me he was trying to get used to being seen as an old man when throughout his political activist days and in prison, he was always ""the young man"".
When the news of his death was announced last week, I had a fleeting idea of going to his funeral but then as he was a Muslim, it was not likely I could make it to South Africa before he would be buried.
Then I thought to myself that even as a Muslim, if he were a Ghanaian, we would have found a way to keep his body in the morgue for a few days at least before burial.
That would have provided the opportunity for old quarrels to be settled and fresh ones to erupt.
There would have been time for some people to go to court to insist that President Zuma be allowed to attend the funeral.
We would have had time to order a special cloth for the funeral and some enterprising folks would have ordered special t-shirts from China.
But before I could get my head around the possibility that this one of the last of those men who were released on 15 October 1989, the funeral was over.
I wonder if South Africa today was the one we all dreamed of in those heady days when the impossible happened and Ahmed Kathrada and his friends came home.
I feel privileged to have been part of it.

"Hundreds of farmers supplying chickens to the poultry processing company are recipients of the heating subsidy.
Earlier Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said the meeting had raised ""fresh concerns"" over the operation of the scheme.
Poultry farmers use the wood chip boilers to heat the buildings where chicks are housed.
Many took advantage of the scheme to replace LPG heating systems.
In his statement, Mr Ó Muilleoir said the Moy Park briefing with his officials had raised ""further issues"".
But in a statement the company made no reference to any concerns about the operation of the scheme.
It said it had met officials from the departments of economy and finance in order to help find a solution ""to secure the Northern Ireland RHI scheme within budget"".
It said it had extensive experience of ""benchmarked energy use"" in the poultry industry.
That appears to be a reference to attempts to establish what would be considered acceptable levels of heat use by poultry farms.

"(CNN) -- Former England cricket captain Michael Atherton has called him ""ruthless,"" but for Lalit Modi, the man behind cricket's revolutionary Indian Premier League and vice-president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), this is less of a criticism and more a statement of fact. Bringing glitz to the game, Lalit Modi is the man behind cricket's Indian revolution. ""I am ruthless, without doubt,"" he told CNN's Talk Asia in Mumbai. ""Otherwise we wouldn't get where we were."" Many believe that Modi, 44, has taken cricket into a new era, turning a sport that can be baffling to watch and take five days to play, into a brightly-colored instant hit of action taking just a few hours. With cheerleaders, the best players in the world and even Bollywood stars as part owners of some of the teams, Modi has concocted a recipe fit for prime-time TV consumption, in a country renown for its passion for the game. Modi's came up with the idea of a new Indian cricket league came 14 years ago, but resisted the involvement of the BBCI at that time, citing too many vested interested within India's main cricketing body that would have spoiled his ideas. While ruthless he is also astute to the financial potential of cricket in India and the IPL. After graduating from Duke University in the U.S. in sports management he returned to India to launch ESPN and 10 Sports. Coming from a family that controls Modi Enterprise, an industrial conglomerate worth $1.5 billion, Modi admits his family were concerned that he was moving away from business and spending so much time with cricket while setting up the IPL. ""They didn't think that I'll be spending so much time with cricket, and cricket has taken up so much time of my time, but the job has made it so demanding. Either I do it well, and if I do it well then I need to give the time for it,"" he told CNN. It's been time well spent, both professionally and personally: Modi has his own private jet, gets mobbed in the streets by fans and can hang out with Bollywood stars. Yet he hasn't made a fortune from the IPL: ""I have an honorary position and BCCI is a charity and a trust. It's a nonprofit-making organization and we do this for development of the game and I'm passionate about the game."" However as vice-president of the BCCI he has been instrumental in boosting its revenues, brokering television deals and sponsorship associations that could see it top the $1 billion mark in the next five years. It's no surprise that such an iconoclastic figure in a game rooted in tradition has his personal critics and those that are skeptical about the direction he is taking the game. Modi was not without controversy himself, as he was accused of drug dealing and abduction while at university, claims that were never proven. The 20-over version of the game played in the IPL has worried some that the finer points of the game may be sacrificed for the instant, mass-market appeal. But for Modi, it's quite simple: ""We've hit records in viewership, record numbers in sponsorships sales, record number in team franchise sales, the owner themselves have done so well, the stadiums are full. We got Bollywood involved, I mean it's a script that I couldn't have written better myself.""","Lalit Modi is the man behind cricket's Indian Premier League .
Has been credited with transforming the game, although not without criticism .
Modi has been called 'the most influential man' in cricket ."
"By . Mark Duell . PUBLISHED: . 12:09 EST, 4 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:28 EST, 4 December 2013 . A paranoid schizophrenic who killed his flatmate and cut off his head was today jailed for life. Karl Addo, who was suffering from delusions of persecution, will serve at least six and half years for killing Sergio Marquez - but may never be released from Broadmoor Hospital because he is so ill. The 30-year-old killer had suffered years of mental illness which led to the extreme complex that he was being assaulted by gangs with special powers and been injected with drugs. Jailed: Karl Addo (left), who was suffering from delusions of persecution, will serve at least six and half years for killing Sergio Marquez (right) - but may never be released from Broadmoor Hospital because he is so ill . Addo - who is now being held at the high-security psychiatric hospital in Crowthorne, West Berkshire - believed Spanish waiter Mr Marquez was part of a gang and that he wanted to kill and torture him. Fearing for his life, Addo snapped on the day he had been told to leave the flat in Bournemouth, Dorset, and brutally killed 23-year-old Mr Marquez. He hit him with a cleaver and stabbed him in what was a ‘prolonged horrific and very violent attack and his body was terribly mutilated,’ Nigel Pascoe QC, prosecuting, told Bournemouth Crown Court. Several doctors assessed Addo as being profoundly mentally ill and borderline insane. He mutilated the body of Mr Marquez to stop him recovering from his injuries, the court heard. Sentencing Addo, a judge told him it was common ground he was dangerous. He said Addo would serve the minimum term but also imposed an indefinite restriction under the Mental Health Act. ‘The result of the sentence I have imposed is that the public now has the double protection provided by the Mental Health Act and the involvement of the parole board,’ Mr Justice Burnett said. Family: Sergio Marquez with his mother Maria Carmen Marquez Torres, who said her son was 'a kind, good-hearted and beautiful man who touched the lives of everyone who met him' ‘You will be detained for at least six and half years but will not be released unless the relevant authorities conclude that is it safe to do so. Praise: Sergio Marquez was a 'bright 23-year-old Spaniard who was living and working in Bournemouth' ‘Given all that I have heard, you must recognise that there is a real possibility that such a conclusion will never be reached.’ Engineering graduate Addo, who was born in Britain but had also lived in the US, absconded from the Huntley Mental Health Centre in Central London where he was a voluntary patient the day before a mental health tribunal in October 2011 decided he should be sectioned. Addo then ‘disappeared’ from mental health services before he moved to Bournemouth in May 2012. He killed Mr Marquez, a hotel waiter, on July 17 last year - nine months later, the court previously heard. The headless body of Mr Marquez, which had also been eviscerated, was found by other flat mates who ran screaming from the flat. Police officers arrested Addo nearby covered in blood, the court was told. He had fled the flat when the others had returned. Flatmates told police that Addo had been acting strangely, that he used to steal food from them and had used book pages as toilet paper. He had not paid his rent and had been told to leave by the landlord, the court heard. Mr Marquez had sent a note about his anti-social behaviour and Addo resented it, the court heard. The victim had tried to defend himself from the attack but was cornered in a room. A neighbour heard some of the attack and Mr Marquez saying ‘please Karl, please Karl’, furniture being dragged around and then Addo laugh, Mr Pascoe said. Reaction: Residents are talked to by police near the scene of Mr Marquez's death in Bournemouth in July 2012 . He was decapitated and disemboweled after he died, the court was told. Addo, of no fixed abode, pleaded not guilty to murder on Monday but guilty to manslaughter through diminished responsibility. 'The brutal killing of this young man has had a profound and lasting impact upon his mother and family' Mr Justice Burnett . The prosecution said the plea was acceptable because Addo had been severely mentally ill when he killed Mr Marquez, who lived in Coin near Malaga in Spain and had come to England to find work. The judge paid tribute to Mr Marquez. ‘He was a bright 23-year-old Spaniard who was living and working in Bournemouth. 'In particular, he wished to improve his English and so his general prospects, not least because of the very difficult economic position in Spain in recent years. Emotional: Maria Carmen Marquez Torres (right) poses with her partner Francisco Segado Ramos following the death of her son Mr Marquez (left) ‘The brutal killing of this young man has had a profound and lasting impact upon his mother and family.’ Speaking after the case, Mr Marquez's mother Maria Carmen Marquez Torres said: ‘Sergio was a kind, good-hearted and beautiful man who touched the lives of everyone who met him. ‘I have lost my son and the world has lost a wonderful man. I believe that I have received justice for me and for Sergio. ‘No sentence would ever be sufficient and nothing will ever compensate me for the loss of my son, but I find comfort in the fact that Mr Addo will not have his freedom for a long time and inflict this pain on any other family.’","Karl Addo, 30, from Dorset, was suffering from delusions of persecution .

"(CNN)A convicted rapist needs to ""rethink"" his strategy as he attempts to resume his professional football career, according to the chief of player welfare in the game in Britain. Ched Evans had been on the cusp of a move to Oldham Athletic, which plays in English football's third tier, but the club pulled out of the deal because of ""unbearable pressure"" on its staff. Linked with a return to former club Sheffield United last year, Evans remains without a club after being released from prison in October having served half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl. Both Oldham and Sheffield United were dissuaded from signing Evans due to pressure from sponsors as well as criticism from leading politicians and also the British public, with thousands signing petitions against his proposed moves. Asked if Evans looked likely to sign for another British side,  chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association Gordon Taylor told the BBC: ""At this moment in time, you would have to say you'd be very doubtful of that. ""It may well be he would have to go abroad but at the moment because he's out on license he can't go abroad so we need a serious rethink now."" Previously refused leave to appeal, Evan's case is now before the Criminal Cases Review Commission, an independent body that reviews potential miscarriages of justice. Hull manager Steve Bruce admitted he had backed Oldham to sign Evans and also believes the Criminal Cases Review Commission will be key to his hopes of playing again. ""I might be upsetting people but there is a question of the rape and how he's been convicted by a jury,"" said Bruce in his press conference prior to Saturday's English Premier League game between Hull and West Bromwich Albion. ""When you do look at the case and look at the evidence then certainly Ched has got a case. ""For me the appeal can't come quick enough for Ched. It must be a frustrating and difficult time for him and I think the events of the appeal, for me, will see Ched be allowed to play football again."" Sheffield United, whom Evans originally joined on leaving Manchester City in 2009, pulled out of their initial approach to sign the player on his release from prison in October following a 160,000-strong petition against the move. And more than 60,000 people signed a petition calling on Oldham not sign Evans. Hartlepool also signaled their interest only to then back away,  while a potential move to Maltese club Hibernians was quashed when the Ministry of Justice clarified its zero-tolerance policy on sex offenders working abroad. Evans' case has also put PFA chief Taylor under pressure after he likened the situation with Evans to that of the families of the 96 people that lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. The tragedy struck following a crush of people at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in Sheffield. After years of appeals by the families involved over the miscarriage of justice, an inquest is now ongoing into events and culpability surrounding the tragedy. ""He wouldn't have been the first person to be found guilty, maintained their innocence and be proved right.,"" said Taylor in an interview with the BBC, referring to Evans. ""We know that happened with Hillsborough. ""It's now unraveling and very different to how it was portrayed at the time, indeed by the police at the time."" Taylor's comments led to calls for him to stand down from his post while Dr Phil Scraton, the main author of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report, wrote to him concerning his ""ill-judged"" remarks. ""Drawing Hillsborough into the maelstrom that has surrounded the Evans case... while suggesting a parallel between these two entirely distinct cases demonstrates not only poor judgment but also extraordinary naivety,"" Scraton wrote. Taylor has since backtracked on his previous remarks apologizing for any offense called. ""I wasn't comparing the case but I was looking for a comparison of the principle really of people looking to have the right to maintaining their innocence and how it's become a national issue and campaign with regard to Ched Evans,"" said Taylor In an interview with BBC Radio. ""In no way was it a comparison of the offenses, it was the principle of establishing the truth and his right to do that. ""As it has turned out, I don't want to upset any of the Hillsborough family support groups. ""We've always been supportive of them. It's far from that. I admire the way, the tenacity and determination to get to the truth and that was the point I was looking to make. ""The last thing I was wanting to do was offend any of them -- quite the opposite. ""And with Ched Evans of course he similarly has that right. He's done his time in prison and has done longer in prison than normal because he's determined to prove his innocence and has the right to return to work."" Under current rules, Evans is permitted to return to playing football despite still serving his conviction on license. But chairman of the Football Association Greg Dyke admitted the regulations may change the over eligibility of players to return to the game under certain circumstances. In the first statement from the FA amid the Evans furore, Dyke said in a statement: ""Rape and sexual violence are abhorrent and unacceptable. This cannot be overstated. ""We have reviewed the Ched Evans case in some detail at the FA and we have examined both the legal requirements and our rules and regulations, and there is no basis for us to intervene directly in this particular case. ""That said, it is important that we continue to look at the issue of behaviour and attitudes within football, and recognize the unique privileges and responsibilities that come with being a participating member of the national game. ""I would encourage the game to consider and discuss this matter and the prospect for future guidelines or codes of conduct. ""The FA will certainly be considering it in line with our own ongoing review of what constitutes public or private communications and behavior.""","Players' chief Gordon Taylor warns convicted rapist Ched Evans he needs to ""rethink"" strategy .

"By . Beth Stebner and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 15:51 EST, 13 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:54 EST, 13 June 2012 . An NYPD cop charged with gunning down an unarmed teenager in the Bronx pleaded not guilty in court today, eliciting cheers from his brethren in blue, but tears from the teen’s parents. New York Police Department Officer Richard Haste, 31, surrendered Wednesday morning and  pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges in a courtroom filled with other officers, relatives of 18-year-old victim Ramarley Graham, and their supporters. Graham was killed during a February 2 narcotics raid in the Wakefield neighbourhood of the Bronx. Haste thought Graham had a gun, and shot him in front of his grandmother and little brother as he tried to flush marijuana down the toilet, officials said. Applause: Richard Haste is applauded as he leaves the court in New York on Wednesday . Supporters try to block photographers from taking pictures as New York City Police Dept. officer Richard Haste, center, gets in a car after posting bail in New York . Anguish: Constance Malcolm, left, and Frank Graham, right, parents of 18-year-old Ramarley Graham cry as they attend the arraignment of NYPD officer Richard Haste . Moment of grief: Haste pleaded not guilty to charges of first- and second-degree manslaughter for the February shooting in the death of 18-year-old Graham . Not guilty: NYPD officer Richard Haste (centre, left) flanked by his lawyers Stuart London, (left) and Michael Martinez, (centre, right) plead not guilty . The scene at Bronx Criminal Court was a dramatic one, as Haste, wearing a dark grey suit and tie and on crutches, uttered only two words: ‘Not guilty,’ according to the New York Daily News. 'Ramarley was only 18,' his mother, Constance Malcolm, said outside court. 'We have too much of this going on and it has to stop. We need it to stop. We can't keep killing our kids. It has to stop. Something has to come out of this.' She then pleaded: 'Help me get justice for my son.' As Haste left the courtroom after posting $50,000 bail, dozens of officers applauded him. He was on crutches because of an unrelated accident and walked slowly to a car, while a small group of protesters chanted anti-police slogans behind him. The February shooting stemmed from an NYPD investigation of a persistent drug trade in the Bronx neighbourhood where Graham lived. At the time, police said investigators identified Graham as a potential suspect and radioed to other officers that he appeared to be armed with a pistol. Day in court: Haste, left, was on crutches from an unrelated incident; right, Judge Martin Marcus, who is presiding over the case, set bail at $50,000 . A witness told police that around the same time, two officers wearing NYPD jackets pulled up and yelled at a man - apparently Graham - 'Police! Don't move!' After the man ducked into Graham's three-family home, the officers found a back entrance, climbed some stairs and broke down the door to a second-floor apartment where Graham lived with his grandmother and other relatives, police said. An officer positioned behind Haste reported seeing Graham run toward a bathroom. He also heard Haste yell, 'Show me your hands!' and 'Gun! Gun!' before a shot rang out, police said. Crammed together in the tiny bathroom, Haste yelled for Graham to hold up his hands, and when the teen reached for his waistband, the officer fired, according to his lawyer, Stuart London. 'I thought he was going to shoot me, so I shot him,' Haste said in a court statement read by Mr London. Haste fired one shot at close range from his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, police said. Graham was struck in the upper chest and collapsed in the bathroom. He was pronounced dead at a hospital. Unarmed: Ramarley Graham, 18, was shot and killed at his Bronx home in February by an NYPD officer . Officials said Graham was trying to flush a small amount of marijuana down the toilet as Haste approached . A search of the apartment didn't turn up any weapons. Police said they found marijuana in the toilet.Officers are allowed to use deadly force when they have a reasonable belief that they are facing an imminent threat of serious injury or death. But in the small Bronx bathroom, it was obvious there was no gun, and Haste should not have fired, District Attorney Robert Johnson said. 'We have too much of this going on and it . has to stop. We need it to stop. We can't keep killing our kids. It has . to stop. Something has to come out of this.' -Constance Malcolm . 'He had to know that he did not see a gun,' he said. However, Mr London said that Haste, who graduated from Lehman High School, had never before fired his gun in the line of duty in four years of service, according to the New York Post. ‘When he woke up that morning, he had no intention of firing his weapon,’ Mr London told the Post.The family has said Graham was shot as his grandmother and his 6-year-old brother looked on. Outside court Wednesday, a large group of supporters said they are holding vigils every Thursday in the Bronx for 18 weeks to celebrate the teen's life. His father, Frank Malcolm, broke down weeping when he said the boy wouldn't be home for Father's Day this weekend. Plea for peace: Outside of court, Constance Malcolm pleaded 'We have too much of this going on and it has to stop. We can't keep killing our kids' Pause: The teen's father Frank takes a moment to close his eyes as Ramarley's mother looks out over the press . 'Haste is going home to his family. When we leave here we're going to the cemetery,' he said. 'I keep asking why. Why did he kill our son? Why, why, did he kill our son? 18 years old. 18. He did nothing to deserve this.' Police Commissioner Ray Kelly ordered a review of whether training and tactics were sufficient in the street narcotics division, where Haste worked. The division differs from full-time narcotics police, who are more specialized. Haste had been on the force for four years and in the unit just weeks before the shooting. He had never before fired his weapon in the line of duty. Kelly said some adjustments were made to the unit after the review. An order was put out codifying requirements officers needed to meet before going into the unit, but he didn't specify what the changes were. Support: The Rev. Al Sharpton, left of centre, puts an arm on the back of Constance Malcolm after the arraignment as she wipes away tears . Outside the courthouse Wednesday, police union president Patrick Lynch said he respected the Graham family's grief but called it a tragedy resulting from a difficult situation. 'Today, we're here to show support for a New York City police officer who was put in a terrible position doing a difficult job,' Lynch said as the protesters chanted, 'NYPD. KKK. How many kids will you kill today?' Supporters of Graham's family said they worry officers were expecting trouble simply because Graham was black. They also say Haste, who is white, used excessive force. 'We're not looking for revenge. We're looking for justice,' the Rev. Al Sharpton, a family supporter, said afterward.","Parents of slain teen Ramarley Graham cried in court today as NYPD officer who shot him pleaded not guilty .

"(CNN) -- Inspectors found mildew on a ceiling and other problems last year at a peanut butter producing plant in Georgia that has been linked to a salmonella outbreak, according to reports released Monday by the state Department of Agriculture. A salmonella outbreak linked to a peanut butter plant has sickened nearly 500 people, the CDC says. But the owner of the Blakely, Georgia, plant -- Virginia-based Peanut Corp. of America -- described the problems as ""relatively minor and for the most part corrected on site."" PCA this month stopped production at the Blakely plant and launched a nationwide recall of peanut butter and peanut paste made there after July 1, 2008. The New York Times reported Monday that Georgia agriculture inspection reports from 2006 and 2007 depicted a series of sanitation lapses in the Blakely plant. Citing an inspection report from August 23, 2007, the Times noted at least three incidences in which ""food-contact surfaces"" were ""not properly cleaned and sanitized."" In an apparent response to the Times article, PCA released a statement saying, ""When the observations were noted during inspections by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, corrective action was taken immediately where possible and subsequently when immediate action was not possible."" The statement, which PCA sent to CNN accompanied by a copy of a state inspection report from last October, said ""the most recent inspection observations by the state [the October inspection report] were relatively minor and for the most part corrected on site."" In the October 23, 2008 report, an inspector said she found ""mildew and possibly some static dust on ceiling of butter storage room."" The report did not specify the amount of mildew. The report continued with the notation, ""Correct By: 11/05/2008,"" but the report did not indicate whether any action was taken or whether a follow-up inspection occurred. Moisture was blamed for an unrelated salmonella outbreak two years ago. That outbreak was traced to a different Georgia peanut processing plant. A June 2008 inspection of PCA's Blakely plant found violations including dust buildup on a fan in the butter room, and ""possible metal flakes from metal scrubber which is used to clean outside of equipment,"" according to an inspection report. The report did not indicate where the flakes were found. PCA has said that the peanut butter and peanut paste made at the Blakely plant were sold in bulk to manufacturers, and that the recall does not involve any peanut butter jars sold directly to consumers. However, more than 125 products that include peanut butter or peanut paste, including Trader Joe's celery with peanut butter packs and nutrition bars from Clif Bar, NutriSystem and Luna, have been recalled in connection with the PCA's recall. See a list of recalled products . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has counted nearly 500 cases of salmonella illnesses in 43 states from the most recent outbreak, and says the bacterial infection might have contributed to seven deaths. The American Peanut Council has a list of peanut products that are not affected by the recall.","Inspectors: Plant linked to salmonella outbreak had mildew, other problems last year .

"Newcastle ended their 20-game losing run in the Premiership with an enthralling 29-24 victory over Exeter Chiefs at Kingston Park. Both sides scored three tries each and had their chances to score a four-try bonus win in an end-to-end second half but, after Noah Cato's 69th-minute score, the Falcons had the edge. Fittingly, Falcons' man of the match Ally Hogg ended 10 minutes of almost unbearable tension for the home crowd - after Tom Catterick crossed over for a try - when he booted the ball into the stand from a scrum right on the Newcastle line to end that losing run. Newcastle Falcons celebrate emphatically at the final whistle with victory over Exeter Chiefs . Newcastle Falcons players celebrate with the Kingston Park faithful in the South Stand on Sunday . It was a cracking game from the start with the Falcons making a mess of the kick-off as the ball rebounded back on the Exeter side and eventually a penalty into the corner saw Thomas Waldrom driven over from the line-out. It was Newcastle who reacted strongest and they launched several penetrating attacks with Hogg, Mark Wilson, Dom Barrow and Alex Tait feeding off Ruki Tipuna's darting runs. Two penalties resulted from the boot of Juan Pablo Socino in the 10th and 12th minutes. But Tipuna then paid the price for trying to run the ball out of defence as he threw a wild pass which saw flanker Ben White snap it up and break through for Exeter's second try. Almost immediately Socino released Hogg down the right and big number eight slipped the ball to Sinoti Sinoti, the winger scoring in the corner to make it 11-10 and then soon afterwards Socino landed a 50-metre penalty to increase the score to 14-10.

It was end-to-end stuff and when Newcastle made a mess of a line-out drive and turned the ball over, Exeter should have scored when they broke away. But Henry Slade kicked ahead when keeping the ball in hand would have really stretched the Falcons, who were vastly relieved to see the ball run into touch. The centre made up for his mistake when he scrambled over in the corner right on the stroke of half-time after some heavy-duty work by the Chiefs forwards and Gareth Steenson's conversion hit the bar to send Exeter take a narrow 15-14 lead into the break. Sinoti's typically aggressive run at the start of the second half led to a penalty which Socino banged into the Exeter 22 where the Chiefs infringed at the line-out maul and Socino slotted the ball home. Gareth Steenson (left) of Exeter Chiefs is tackled by Adam Powell of Newcastle Falcons . But then three penalties from Steenson in the space of 13 minutes swung then game in Exeter's favour. A careless offside from Tipuna's box kick allowed Steenson to kick in the 52nd minute and then the Exeter fly half kicked another five minutes later for handling in the ruck, followed by a third for a scrummage offence in the 65th. But then Newcastle scored twice in three minutes to stand the game on its head. Adam Powell and Gonzalo Tiesi combined to send in Catterick under the posts before Socino converted to level the scores at 24-24. Newcastle swept back through Rob Hawkins' superb offload to Tait down the left and Cato scored in the corner to make it 29-24 leaving Newcastle in the driving seat as the clock counted down.","The Newcastle Falcons edged out the Exeter Chiefs at Kingston Park .

"(CNN) -- The paint is peeling, puddles litter the inside of the building, putrid water lies in what was supposed to be a swimming pool and even the statue of the man who had the vision to build the sports complex is cracked -- a sad and inglorious tribute to Marc-Vivien Foe 10 years to the day after the Cameroonian's tragic death. Once earmarked as a state-of-the-art $10 million sports academy, the only inhabitants today are not the next generation of Indomitable Lions but a handful of squatters and policemen -- with Foe's father funding the latter because of the high risk of theft in this corner of Yaounde. Those are not Martin Foe's only financial concerns because his bitter row with Marc-Vivien's widow Marie-Louise over the distribution of the estate of the two-time African champion, double French league winner and former Premier League star lies at the heart of the complex's decline. With Martin claiming that Marc-Vivien's properties should be returned to his side of the family and the star's wife -- neither relative would speak directly to CNN -- believing she should be the recipient, the duo are at such loggerheads that a resolution seems incredibly remote. It's a dispute made all the more tragic given the former international's body lies in the all-but-abandoned complex. Shortly after the midfielder died of cardiac arrest during a Confederations Cup semi-final on 26 June 2003, Cameroon's government pledged funds to ensure completion of a project started by a man who was posthumously decorated as a Commander of the National Order of Valor. The country's then prime minister laid the medal on top of Foe's coffin as some 3,000 mourners - including further government dignitaries, FIFA president Sepp Blatter and Cameroon's football squad -- gathered at the four-hectare site. But because of the intense familial row -- while a government promise of funds also failed to materialize -- the real legacy of Foe's death is not to be found in a suburb of Cameroon's capital but in the world's international football stadiums instead. ""Foe's death really shook FIFA and what changed was the attitude of the Executive Committee and other decision-makers towards medicine and the health of the players,"" Professor Jiri Dvorak, FIFA's chief medical officer, told CNN from Brazil. ""There were already medical courses in place and we were aware of the issue of cardiac arrest, but that was the extent of what we were doing. But once we experienced it live, in front of rolling TV cameras, we realized the reality of the situation and understood we had to do more. ""It made me certain that prevention was the way to go and so many, many new regulations have been implemented since then to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death on the pitch."" Medical screening . Football's world governing has acted steadily over the years to try to ensure that there are as few repeats as possible of the awful scenes that were broadcast to millions around the world from Lyon a decade ago. The French city was, ironically, the very one where Foe's registration was kept although English side Manchester City had been keen to sign the tall Cameroonian -- who had been with them on loan the preceding year -- on a permanent basis. They would never get the chance as the then 28-year-old collapsed in the 72nd minute of the semifinal against Colombia with no-one around him. An opponent was the first to notice the seriousness of the situation and unlike the swift treatment given to Bolton Wanderers' Fabrice Muamba at Tottenham Hotspur last year, medical assistance was slow to arrive. Despite attempts to resuscitate him for 45 minutes and the fact that he was still alive when taken to the ground's medical center, Foe died because of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy -- a condition that involves an abnormal thickening of the heart muscle. Those who are prone to the problem are up to five times more likely to suffer a cardiac arrest when exercising intensively than they would be when leading a sedentary lifestyle. As the tributes flooded in for a talented player with terrific stamina and, according to those who knew him, a permanent smile on his face, FIFA reacted by making it mandatory to equip all stadiums hosting international matches with automated external defibrillators. In addition, the organization introduced medical screenings of all players ahead of any FIFA competition -- a policy which was of clear benefit to all the recipients, but especially those from Foe's continent. At the African Under-17 Championship in Algeria, FIFA -- in conjunction with the continental body CAF and the local FA -- medically assessed all 160 players and unwittingly discovered that nearly 70% of the teenagers had never seen a doctor before in their lives. Late last month, FIFA issued all of its 209 member associations a Medical Emergency Bag, one which the global body says is similar to those in use by the American and South African military and which, more importantly, boasts a defibrillator among its contents. However, Dvorak readily concedes that the bag will be largely worthless unless the training of teams' medical personnel is up to scratch. ""It is important that the doctors and paramedics are adequately educated to be able to use it in case of emergency, but we can never guarantee that the right training is being done all around the world,"" said the Czech. ""Definitely at those competitions where we are responsible, like the Confederations Cup here in Brazil, we check that the relevant people are able to understand what they have in their hands -- and how important it is that they know."" All the more so since the first symptom of those suffering hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can sometimes be death itself, while footballers to have died of cardiac issues in recent years form a depressingly long list -- with the cases of Antonio Puerta (Sevilla), Daniel Jarque (Espanyol) and Phil O'Donnell (Motherwell) prominent among them. While the medical measures undertaken by FIFA form part of Foe's legacy, a final chapter continues to play out wherever Cameroon's Indomitable Lions roam. Irreplaceable midfielder . The first team from Africa to reach the World Cup quarterfinals (in 1990), Cameroon were feared at the time of Foe's death -- with the team having added the 2002 Nations Cup to their 2000 title as they became the first to win back-to-back crowns in nearly four decades. Since the death of a central midfielder who has simply proved irreplaceable in the middle -- a box-to-box player with aerial presence and a calming, disciplined demeanor -- Cameroon's footballing fortunes have steadily declined. They have not won a match at the World Cup since Foe's death (missing out on Germany 2006 altogether) nor another African title -- and political rows and team squabbling have meant the four-time continental champions have failed to qualify for the last two Nations Cups. The last month has been indicative of the country's recent woes, with World Cup qualification having hung by a thread until opponents Togo -- who beat Cameroon earlier this month -- were found to have fielded an ineligible player during the qualifier, meaning the Lions may be awarded some fortuitous points instead. At the same time, the football federation chose to re-elect Iya Mohamed as president -- despite the fact he was being detained by local police at the time after being accused of transgressions connected to his role as director-general of the state-owned Cotton Development Company. A once proud game is, in short, something of a mess -- and perhaps the crumbling complex where the patriotic Marc-Vivien Foe lies is a fitting, if sad, reflection of the lamentable state of Cameroonian football today.","26 June 2013 is the10th anniversary of Marc-Vivien Foe's death .

"The failure of teachers to control badly behaved children in lessons is dragging down standards, the chief inspector of schools will warn this week. Too many teachers have come to believe that poor discipline is an inevitable part of life in the classroom and heads need to crack down on the problem, Sir Michael Wilshaw will say. He will deliver his verdict after the publication of a major report by the schools inspectorate Ofsted, showing that a vast amount of teaching time is wasted because staff are struggling to control problem pupils. Scroll down for video . Head of Ofsted Sir Michael Wilshaw, centre, said teachers need to crack down on poor classroom discipline . Teacher unions hit back last night, accusing Sir Michael of ‘talking nonsense’ by suggesting teachers accepted poor discipline, arguing instead that they were being let down by out-of-touch senior staff. The Oftsed report, based on specially commissioned surveys of teachers and parents and more than 3,000 school inspections, found that most teachers admit they are plagued by pupils making silly comments to get attention, swinging on chairs, passing notes around, humming or using mobile phones. Many teachers complained that heads were failing to back them and did not assert their authority when dealing with pupils flouting rules. The findings will bolster Sir Michael’s concerns that ‘a culture of casual acceptance’ of persistent disruption was preventing England’s school system from competing with high-performing Asian countries. This week he will also say that while serious breaches of discipline are less common today, the chances of pupils being in calm and well-ordered classrooms had become ‘something of a lottery’, damaging their future prospects. Ofsted’s annual report in December found that 700,000 pupils were attending schools where behaviour needed to improve. Chris Keates, general secretary of NASUWT said teachers are not failing to address disruptive pupils . And in a challenge to heads, he will argue that strong leadership is the key to cracking down on disruptive behaviour and creating good conditions for learning. Chris Keates, general secretary of union NASUWT, said her members acknowledged there was a widespread problem with low- level disruption in lessons. But she added: ‘The Chief Inspector is, as usual, talking nonsense to suggest that teachers accept this and are failing to address it. ‘What teachers do say is that… they are frequently unsupported by school leaders who too often do not teach and are divorced from the day to day realities of life in the classroom.’ Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘Behaviour in the vast majority of schools is good and continually improving, according to Ofsted itself. ‘We agree that school leaders must support staff. ‘Good behaviour comes from the skills of teachers but also from a consistent policy across the institution.’","Sir Michael Wilshaw of Ofsted said schools had problems with discipline .

But a trio of Chicago teens stand accused of just that after being arrested this week on auto burglary charges. Police have publicly thanked a local resident who called authorities and accurately described the serial thieves, allowing officers to track them down and put an end to the crime spree. 'Because that one person took the time to call there, there are definitely dozens of other people whose things aren't going to go missing at this point,' Park Ridge Deputy Police Chief Lou Jogmen told CBS Chicago. Good at what they do: Michael Staples, 17 (left), Nikolas Pena, 18 (right), and Stevan Bulatovic, 18 (below), are accused of stealing cash and valuables from at least 100 cars in a one-month Chicago crime spree . Chicago police say the three teens 'spent less than a minute' in each car and were capable of breaking into 12 in one night. Stevan Bulatovic (pictured) is one of the trio facing charges . Stevan Bulatovic, 18, Nikolas Pena, 18, and Michael T. Staples, 17, all of Harwood Heights, currently face one misdemeanor count of criminal trespass to a motor vehicle each, and two counts of burglary to a motor vehicle. But police say the three are responsible for more than 100 car burglaries in Chicago and across surrounding suburbs Park Ridge, Northbrook, Glenview, Niles and are looking to press further charges. Deputy Police Chief Jogmen said the young men typically targeted unlocked vehicles late at night. They moved quickly to take anything they could. The three walked away with cash, laptop computers, cell phones, cameras, GPS systems, wallets and other valuables. They would would hit up to 12 cars a night, according to police. Chicago: Police say the team of three would wait for the cover of darkness before hitting cars late at night . 'It was in and out,' said Jogmen. 'They were literally in the car for a minute or less and then they moved on to the next one - just went up the block and continued to pull on doors and when they found an open one they went inside, saw what they could take, and took it.' But it wasn't every night. 'I'm sure they took a couple days off here and there,' Jogmen said.

"GENEVA, Switzerland (Reuters)  -- Extreme sexual violence against women is pervasive in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and local authorities do little to stop it or prosecute those responsible, a U.N. investigator said on Monday. A woman struggles to describe her rape by military members. Health workers call rape an epidemic. Rape and brutality against women and girls are ""rampant and committed by non-state armed groups, the Armed Forces of the DRC, the National Congolese Police, and increasingly also by civilians"", said Turkish lawyer Yakin Erturk. ""Violence against women seems to be perceived by large sectors of society to be normal,"" she added in a report after an 11-day trip to the strife-torn country. Erturk, special rapporteur for the United Nations Human Rights Council on violence against women, said the situation in South Kivu province, where rebels from neighboring Rwanda operate, was the worst she had ever encountered. The atrocities perpetrated there by armed groups, some of whom seemed to have been involved in the 1994 Rwandan massacres in which 800,000 people were killed, ""are of an unimaginable brutality that goes far beyond rape,"" she said. ""Women are gang-raped, often in front of their families and communities. In numerous cases, male relatives are forced at gun point to rape their own daughters, mothers or sisters,"" she said. After rape, many women were shot or stabbed in the genital area, and survivors told Erturk that while held as slaves by the gangs they had been forced to eat excrement or the flesh of their murdered relatives. Women who have been raped are systematically rejected by their families and society. Widespread sexual abuse in the various conflicts racking the republic -- which last year held elections hailed as marking a new era -- ""seems to have become a generalized aspect of the overall oppression of women,"" Erturk said. Her report followed charges from U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour last week that soldiers and police used excessive force, including summary executions, in quelling opposition protesters in the west of the DRC earlier this year. In the central Equateur province, the police and army often responded to civil unrest ""with organized armed reprisals that target the civilian population and involve indiscriminate pillage, torture and mass rape"", the report found. Although the DRC parliament outlawed sexual violence in July 2006, ""little action is taken by the authorities to implement the law and perpetrators continue to enjoy immunity, especially if they wear the state's uniform,"" Erturk said. Erturk said Congo's justice system was corrupt and in ""a deplorable state,"" while conditions in prisons were ""scandalous"". Senior army and police officers shielded their men from prosecution, and when some were arrested they escaped easily, probably ""with the complicity of those in charge."" In a few cases courts had ordered the state and individuals to compensate victims. But ""to this day the government has not paid reparations to a single victim who has suffered sexual violence at the hand of state agents,"" said  E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court offered its tentative endorsement of so-called ""organizing agreements"" between unions and for-profit companies, with some justices saying on Wednesday the longstanding practice can encourage good labor relations. At issue is whether the particulars of such an agreement between Unite Here Local 355 and the Mardi Gras casino in Florida violates a federal law that prohibits companies from giving labor unions-- seeking to represent workers-- anything ""of value."" Worker rights experts and business groups have called this one of the most significant labor relations cases in decades, and a high court ruling could have major implications for the future of the union movement in the United States. The gaming union entered into a ""neutrality"" agreement with the company, agreeing to work together to pass a ballot initiative legalizing slot machines in Dade and Broward Counties, a deal that ostensibly would benefit both sides. Unite Here independently spent more than $100,000 in an ad campaign supporting the measure. It also agreed not to strike or boycott. The casino in return allowed union members onto the premises, gave them employee contact information, and agreed to remain neutral in the organizing campaign. The high court debated in oral arguments whether this particular agreement violated the letter and spirit of the broader law, designed to prevent bribery, corruption and extortion in negotiations and organizing. A lower federal appeals court said ""if the $100,000 bought the peaceful recognition provisions, then that's corrupt, and that is outside the exemptions that the law provides,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor. ""Tell me how I deal with that niggling problem I have about the $100,000, because it does feel like a bribe to the employer."" But Justice Elena Kagan said, ""I would have thought that the premise and the policies of the labor laws are to encourage a wide variety of employer/employee agreements,"" she said. ""The idea is to get these parties together to reach agreements on a wide variety of things that matter to them, regardless whether the labor law specifically refers to that."" The lawsuit was brought by Martin Mulhall, an employee of Hollywood Greyhound Track Inc., who opposed the union's efforts to get him to join. Backed by the National Right to Work Foundation, his lawyers said ""backroom deals"" between company and union management undercut his right of association and free choice. Section 302 of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 makes it a crime for an employer to ""pay, lend or deliver ... any money or other thing of value"" to a union that wants to represent its workforce. ""That's the danger that 302 exists to take care of, not that it's necessarily wrongful per se for a union to have lists of (employee) information or the use of property, but what will it do in return?"" attorney William Messenger told the high court in an intense hour of oral augments. ""And unions have compromised employee interests in exchange for this type of assistance. They certainly have extorted employers."" Several justices suggested the casino and the union were engaged in a quid pro quo, but were not sure that amounted to an exchange of something of ""value."" ""I mean, the union wouldn't promise that for nothing,"" said Justice Antonin Scalia. ""It would get something in exchange such as, in this case, the right to go on the employer's property to recruit union members or some other thing of value from the employer, right?"" But Richard McCracken, Unite Here's lawyer, said this neutrality agreement and the $1000,000 ad campaign were like so many others, including the pending deal to build a massive oil pipeline through the middle section of the United States. ""The union, like so many construction unions that we know, is advocating in Congress for the passage of laws like the Keystone Pipeline Law. Why did they do that? They do it because they want the jobs,"" he said. ""That is a combination of interests funneled through the First Amendment's protection for mutual effort."" Justice Anthony Kennedy seemed to agree, telling Messenger that his client's views run ""contrary to years of settled practices and understandings."" Unite Here represents about 265,000 active members in the United States and Canada, mainly in the hospitality, food service and manufacturing industries. The case is Unite Here Local 355 v. Mulhall (12-99). A ruling is expected by the spring.","Case involves agreement between union and Florida casino .

"(CNN) -- This week marks one of the most-exciting non-major events of the golf season -- the Players Championship at the famed TPC Sawgrass. With a deep field and a great course, you won't want to miss any of the action. Before the tournament tees off, we had a chance to catch up with TPC Sawgrass PGA Head Professional Matt Borocz, who provided some inside insight on the home of the PGA Tour. PGA.com: Thanks for joining us. This week presents one of the most exciting on the schedule with the Players Championship. What is it that makes the Players such a special event? Borocz: It's the Players Championship... The Players is crown jewel of the PGA Tour. The world's best golfers are on a course that demands the highest level of shot-making and offers an unbelievable fan experience. It's also the highest purse in golf with the champion taking home $1.71 million at the end of the week. The Players Stadium Course was specifically built to host the Players Championship and offer our fans the best possible viewing. Everyone wants to see the action on the final three holes, especially the 17th. It's the lure of the hole and watching the best players in the world challenge the island green. PGA.com: We can't talk about the Players without mentioning the world-famous, par-3 17th island green, which you just touched on. I recently heard a promo with a player saying, ""51 weeks a year, No. 17 at TPC Sawgrass is the easiest hole in the world for Tour players."" I don't know if I would agree with that, but of course, that 52nd week is the Players. We know why it's daunting, but it's less than 150 yards. Is there any truth to what that Tour player said? Borocz: A few stats on the 17thhole -- it plays 121 yards from the middle of the championship tee to the front of the green. To the back of the green it's 146 yards. The 17th green is 3,912 square feet compared to the average of 4,500 square feet. The challenge of the 17th hole is its ability to taunt the mental toughness of a player. It's a very calculating shot because you have to factor the wind, firmness of the green and avoid looking at the body of water surrounding the island green. During the Players, you add in the thousands of fans! We give tours every day to visitors and the No. 1 comment of amazement is, ""The green looks so small compared to television."" Making a par 3 on the 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass will bring a smile to all players, whether they are a novice or the best players in the world. PGA.com: Henrik Stenson of Sweden is your defending champion. Through the years with the likes of Stenson, Sergio Garcia, Adam Scott, Stephen Ames, Steve Elkington, Greg Norman, Nick Price -- the list goes on -- the Players has had quite a list of international champions. What is it about the course that yields such diverse champions? Borocz: In the 36-year history of the Players, 10 of the victories have been by international players. The Players Stadium Course does not favor any style of player. The goal of former Commissioner Deane Beman was to create a golf course that had balance in regards to distance, wind direction and shot-making. He wanted to create a goal course that was fair and would challenge every skill of the game. The goal at the end of week is to crown the greatest player in world. The diversity of the field allows the Players and PGA Tour to expand the scope of the tournament to a world-wide audience. PGA.com: In 1994, Greg Norman won the Players with a remarkable 24-under 264. That's by far the best winning score in tournament history. Is there any chance someone could come within a sniff of that this year? Borocz: In 1994, when Greg Norman set the overall tournament record, the conditions started off perfect the first round with 76 players shooting under par. Norman started off on Thursday with a course-record round of 63, followed by three rounds of 67's to beat Fuzzy Zoeller by four shots. In 1994, the Players was played in March. With the tournament now being played in May the course is much firmer and faster conditions. In March, we had a lot of inconsistency in weather. It could be in the high 70s and beautiful or in the 50s with rain. The temperatures have become much more consistent, but the golf course plays much differently. When played in March, the golf course was overseeded. It's now Bermuda grass all year. The golf ball has more opportunity to run through the fairways and the greens. The forecast is shaping up to be a beautiful week. PGA.com: Final question. What's the best part about working at TPC Sawgrass? Borocz: Excellent question... TPC Sawgrass is a very special place being that it's the home of the Players and PGA Tour. It is a privilege to work around such a passionate and dedicated group of people. Everyone on our team is focused on creating a magical experience for the Tour players, members and guests. Every team member comes to the club with a positive ""can do"" attitude. We have a team that is extremely dedicated and passionate about their role at the club. One of the most special things about TPC Sawgrass is the interaction with all the people that travel from all over the world to visit. Many of them have personal stories and connections why TPC Sawgrass is their favorite course. There are definitely days that you have to pinch yourself. We are very fortunate to have the opportunity to work at such a beautiful place that is showcased to the world every year. As a club and being apart of the PGA Tour, we have a lot of involvement with local charitable organizations. Almost every month we have a charitable initiative that we are giving back to you. It's an honor and a blessing to be a part of such a great team.","The Players is ""crown jewel"" of the PGA Tour .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A manufacturing defect blamed for the mid-air breakup of an F-15 Eagle fighter may cause the Air Force to ground a quarter of its fleet of those warplanes permanently, a top general said Thursday. The mid-air breakup of an F-15 fighter jet is being blamed on a a manufacturing defect. Gen. John Corley, the head of the U.S. Air Combat Command, said about 160 of the jets may never return to service after an investigation into the November 2 crash that left the plane's pilot seriously injured. The single-seat F-15C broke up in a 500-mph turn during a combat training mission over Missouri, with its fuselage breaking in half behind the cockpit, an Air Force probe of the crash determined. Investigators concluded that a critical piece of the jet's airframe broke during the flight because of a manufacturing defect. A defective longeron -- a metal strut that runs lengthwise down the fuselage -- was cut improperly by the manufacturer, Boeing, and led to a series of cracks over the plane's lifespan, Corley said.  Watch a report on the plane and its problems » . ""Some of these airplanes will never return to flight,"" Corley said. ""The age, the fatigue on these airplanes has been manifest as we looked under the hood extensively over these last two months."" The Air Force has been flying the twin-engine, supersonic F-15 since the early 1970s. The C model involved in November's crash is credited with 34 of the 37 ""kills"" credited to Air Force pilots in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, according to Thursday's report on the accident. The service has about 700 F-15s in its fleet, all of which were grounded after the November crash. Most were returned to service after being checked out, but about 40 percent of the Air Force's 442 F-15 models A through D remain grounded. ""I flew these airplanes 30 years ago,"" Corley told CNN ""This is a fleet of airplanes that's 25-plus years old on average. That constant pulling and pushing and twisting has also caused fatigue."" If the grounded planes are retired, the Air Force would still have about 240 of the older fighters and nearly 300 of the newer F-15E, a two-seat version used for ground-attack missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Investigators released the results of the Missouri crash at a news conference Thursday in the St. Louis suburb of Bridgeton, home of the Air National Guard wing involved in the accident. The pilot, 37-year-old Maj. Stephen Stillwell, told reporters that his plane broke up in a turn that produced about eight times the force of gravity. ""I had no idea what was happening,"" he said. ""I knew something bad was happening, but I didn't know what it was."" Stillwell suffered a broken arm and still has problems with his shoulder. He credited his survival to the training he received. ""You always prepare for the worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""I think luck played a small part in it, but a large part of it was due to the training I received and my faith in God,"" said Stillwell, who is also a pilot for Northwest Airlines. Col. Bob Leeker, the wing's commander, said the first four of his F-15s took off Thursday after receiving clearance. Six other planes in the 131st Fighter Wing have not been released, but three are expected to be once additional examinations are completed, he said. The F-15 was first built by McDonnell-Douglas, and it's now manufactured by Boeing. The service is trying to determine whether Boeing would be liable for the defect after 30 years. The A through D models are used in the United States for air-defense missions. After the initial grounding, the service had to move F-16s to cover for F-15 missions, and Canadians had to help cover missions over Alaska, according to Air Force officials. The defect was discovered as the Air Force continues to fight for more advanced F-22 Raptors, seen as the future of the service's fighter fleet. Congress allowed the purchase of only 183 of the almost 400 the Air Force wanted, but the service continues to ask for another 200. Corley said suggestions that the service is trying to use the problems with the F-15 as leverage to get more of the Lockheed-built F-22s ""makes me just outraged, because it's just flat wrong."" ""I'm the one who looks into the eyes of the moms and dads, the sons and daughters, the husbands and wives that I put in that airplane,"" he said. ""To think that I would put one of those individuals at risk, to almost kill one aviator and to risk other aviators, that is beyond my possible belief.""

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:49 EST, 30 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:35 EST, 1 May 2013 . An elderly man broke down in tears on Monday as a jury heard how he was almost carved in half by a mentally-ill man with two power saws on a New York City subway platform. Michael Steinberg, 70, choked on his emotions at the first day of trial in his suit against an MTA contractor - whom he blames for leaving the power tools unattended - at Manhattan Supreme Court. He was attacked by  Tareyton Williams as he stood on the platform at 110th Street and Broadway in the early hours of July 6, 2006. He has said he does not blame Williams  for the attack. Instead, he holds Five Star Electric . Corp. responsible for failing to lock down the tools and for its staff . for not coming to help him during the bloody attack. Victim: Michael Steinberg, pictured recovering in hospital after he was attacked by a saw-wielding madman on a subway platform in 2006, has sobbed in court as the jury heard the details of the horror . 'I almost died,' Steinberg told the New York Post outside the court. 'I don't want to live through this . again. It's just because they don't . want to reach a settlement of any kind.' His lawyer, Ronald Landau, added: 'There was nobody and nothing to prevent anybody - crazy person, . sane person, thief, nonthief - from walking over to those power tools . and just lifting them off.' Landau added that Williams had been acting bizarrely before the attack, yelling and pacing. At court on Monday, the contractor's . attorney, Barbara Sheehan, said a worker was just two or three feet of . the tools, when Williams grabbed two saws and unleashed his attack. 'What we have is an unexpected, . unforeseeable action by somebody who did something that really none of . us could really conceive of,' Sheehan said. Locked up: Tareyton Williams, pictured, apologized to Steinberg before he was sentenced to 18 years in prison. The victim said he does not blame Williams - rather the MTA contractor for leaving the tools unguarded . Weapon: Police remove one of two sawzall saws from a garbage can after they were ditched Williams . Williams was sentenced to 18 years in . prison for the attack and, before he was locked up, he apologized to . his victim. Steinberg said he forgave him. Mr Steinberg said he must now take Valium pills before using the subway to calm him. On the night of the attack, Mr . Williams calmly walked towards the 4-foot-11 Mr Steinberg with the two . chainsaws and began cutting into his chest. The two power saws, called Sawzalls, sliced through his ribs and punctured his lung. The elderly New York native begged his attacker to stop carving, offering him cash and credit cards, but he ignored the pleas. Finally he stopped, said 'now I will take your credit cards and your money' and walked calmly away. At the time, Mr Steinberg told the media how construction workers had ignored his cries for help. Scene: The former postal worker was in the 110th and Broadway station on his way to work when he was attacked with the two saws, and he said contractors just stood back and failed to help him . 'I screamed for help. 'Please help! Please help me!' The ... people (construction workers) heard me. They just looked. They never stopped to help me, and that disturbed me more than anything else. I begged for somebody to call an ambulance and to get this guy off me,' he explained to the Post. Doctors said if the saws had cut just a millimetre deeper, the postal worker would have been dead. Williams was arrested after punching a man walking his dog later that day and pleaded guilty to senseless assault. Steinberg, who was forced to quit his job, said the Transit Authority or Five Star Electric Corp. have never apologized for allowing the near fatal attack to take place.","Michael Steinberg, now 70, suffered sliced ribs and a punctured lung after a madman came at him with two chainsaws that were left on the platform .

"One in 20 women (5%) aged between 16 and 59 reported using an illicit substance in the past year, the Crime Survey for England and Wales found.
This was the lowest level since the records started in 1996. It had peaked at 8.8% in 2000 and 2003-04.
Among men, 11.8% reported using drugs over the past year - a figure which has also fallen in recent years.
Susanne Hakimi, from the charity Action on Addiction's Hope House - a residential treatment centre for women - said drug use among women has been ""hidden away behind closed doors"".
She said: ""Some women tell us they are afraid to seek help for fear of losing their children. Although addiction generally is still highly stigmatised, we are seeing more women coming to us for treatment for drug use and being a little more open about their recovery.
""Once this starts to happen, we believe it can be contagious and one person in recovery can, with the right support, encourage and support someone else to recover from addiction.""
The Home Office figures suggested drug use was higher among young people.  Nearly one in five (18.0%) of young adults aged 16-24 had taken an illicit drug in the last year- around 1.1 million people, the figures show.
This was similar to the 2014-15 survey (19.5%), but lower compared with a decade ago (25.2% in the 2005-06 survey).
Professor Kevin Fenton, national director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England, commented: ""These new figures show that drug use has been largely stable over the last five years and continues to be considerably lower than 10 to 15 years ago.""
However, usage of cocaine and ecstasy jumped among people from wealthier households, the figures suggested.
In 2015/16, 3% of people aged 16 to 59 from households with incomes of at least Â£50,000 reported taking cocaine - up from 2.2% in 2014/15.
The proportion in the same category who had used ecstasy was 2.2% - up from 1.5%.
Simon Antrobus, chief executive of the charity Addaction, said the increases reflected factors including wider availability and ""a cultural shift which has increasingly normalised those substances"".
It comes as separate figures showed that the number of people being admitted to hospital after being poisoned by illegal drugs has soared by more than 50% in the past 10 years.
There were 14,279 hospital admissions where 'poisoning by illicit drugs' was the main diagnosis in 2014-15, a rise of 57% since 2004-05, figures released by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, showed.","Drug use among women in England and Wales has dropped to its lowest level in at least 20 years, figures suggest."

"(CNN) -- The Zumba instructor in Maine who ran a prostitution ring out of her fitness studio Saturday was released from jail early for good behavior and participating in a work program, according to a York County Jail spokesman. Alexis Wright, 29, walked out of the Maine jail at 8 a.m. Saturday after serving nearly six months of a ten-month term for a prostitution case that last year rocked the sleepy New England town of Kennebunk. Her client list, including accountants, lawyers and even a local TV personality, became the talk of the picturesque Maine town. The State Police and the Drug Enforcement Administration began investigating the prostitution ring in 2011 after receiving a tip that there was more going on at the studio than a Latin dance fitness party. In February 2012, Wright's Zumba studio was raided. Court documents showed that Wright videotaped intimate encounters with some of her customers in three locations -- including her store-front Zumba exercise studio -- and would send the footage to her business partner, Mark Strong. Attorneys act to conceal names in Zumba sex case . According to Strong's sentencing memo, Wright would not engage in a prostitution session unless Strong had ""prior knowledge of the session and was actively watching via the Skype connection."" More than 13,000 Skype video call snapshots were recovered from Strong's computer, according to the memo. Strong was found guilty of promotion of prostitution and conspiracy to promote prostitution in March. He was sentenced to 20 days in jail, court documents said. In addition to jail time, Wright was ordered to pay $57,000 in restitution and $1,000 in fines. Prosecutors dropped more than 80 other counts and reduced more serious tax-related charges from felonies to misdemeanors, according to the sentencing documents. CNN's calls to Wright and her attorney were not returned. Talk of the town: Who's on 'The List' of alleged sex clients?

"The universe as we know it may not be the only one in existence. In fact, it could be one of a number of parallel universes making up a ‘multiverse.’ In this scenario, there could be multiple versions of you in different universes – ones doing exactly the same thing, and others where your 'twin' has made completely different life choices. It may be stretching the imagination, but theory has gained traction following the major discovery of gravitational waves on Monday. Scroll down for video... The discovery of these gravitational waves could solidify the idea that our young universe went through inflation. That theory is linked to the idea that the universe is constantly giving birth to different, parallel universes . Earlier this week, astronomers detected what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang. This very brief moment of time at the beginning of everything is when the universe expanded very rapidly - a theory called cosmic inflation. According to Albert Einstein when something very explosive like this happens it leaves ripples in space-time known as 'gravitational waves'. Gravitational waves from cosmic inflation generate a faint but distinctive twisting pattern in the universe. Shown here is the pattern observed with the Bicep2 telescope, providing evidence for cosmic inflation after the Big Bang, although the results have been called into question . Enlarge . This graphic shows the universe as it evolved from the Big Bang to now. Nasa scientists believe that the universe expanded from subatomic scales to the astronomical in just a fraction of a second after its birth . Astronomers announced on Monday that they  ripples in the fabric of space-time that are echoes of the massive expansion of the universe after the Big Bang. Predicted by Albert Einstein nearly a century ago, the discovery of the ripples, called gravitational waves, would be a crowning achievement the understanding of how the universe began and evolved. The ‘multiverse’ theory is based on the fact that these gravitational wave point to a particularly powerful type of inflation of the early universe. In some regions of physical reality inflation, continues and in others it stops. In the regions where it has stopped someone looking back on this time would see a 'bang' - the birth of their universe. The ‘multiverse’ theory is based on the fact that these primordial gravitational wave point to a particularly powerful type of inflation of the early universe. ‘In most models, if you have inflation, then you have a multiverse,’ said Stanford physicist Andrei Linde speaking at a conference on Monday. Theorists argue that every kind of universe is out there in the aftermath of the Big Bang, from our familiar universe to universes that have completely different physical properties. 'When it comes to inflation, universes beyond our own come wrapped up as part of the package – what we see as our universe is what remained after inflation ceased in this part of reality,' Colin Stuart, author of 'The Big Questions in Science', told MailOnline. 'What's just been found is “a smoking . gun” for inflation – the most concrete evidence we have to date that it . actually happened. So the multiverse is looking more likely than ever.' Scientists, from left, Clem Pryke, Jamie Bock, Chao-Lin Kuo and John Kovac smile during a news conference at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge to announce their groundbreaking results on gravitational waves . The term ‘multiverse’ was invented in December 1960, by Andy Nimmo, then vice chairman of the British Interplanetary Society. It is based on the theory of eternal inflation, which suggests that shortly after the Big Bang that formed the universe, space-time expanded at different rates in different places. According to eternal inflation theory, this gave rise to bubble universes that may function with their own separate laws of physics. The idea of other universes out there may seem strange, but scientists say it can help solve some problems of fundamental physics. For instance, the long-standing mystery of why nature appears to be fine-tuned for the emergence of life can be explained by the picture of a multiverse. Some scientists argue that intelligent observers exist only in those rare areas in which the conditions happen to be just right for life to evolve.  The rest of the multiverse remains barren, but no one is there to notice it. Another multiverse theory suggests that if space-time goes on forever, it must start repeating at some point, because there are a . finite number of ways particles can be arranged. The multiverse theory could explain a number of processes that have stumped cosmologists for years. For example, there is the 1998 discovery that galaxies in our universe seem to be spreading apart at an accelerating rate. This goes against the rule that mutual gravitational attraction should be slowing them down. If there were multiverses, our universe may happen to be one in which the dark energy is relatively weak. It could also resolve the dilemma in ‘superstring’ theory. At its most basic level, describes all subatomic particles as vibrating filaments and membranes of energy. The string theory only works in ten or eleven dimensions. 'Such a multiverse might even explain the very reason we exist at all,' said Mr Stuart.'The natural forces at work in our universe, like gravity, for example, seem strangely fined tuned for life. Cosmologists studying a map of the universe from data gathered by the Planck spacecraft concluded that it shows anomalies that can only have been caused by the gravitational pull of other universes . 'Tinker with the settings of nature even slightly and that creates a universe devoid of stars, planets and people. How come all the settings are perfectly suited for living things? 'It seems an extremely unlikely coincidence. However, if there really are a multitude of other universes out there, each with their own settings, at least one of them will have the right settings for life. 'Our existence moves from being highly improbable to inevitable. In fact, if the number of other universes is infinite, there are an infinite number of copies of Earth out there, with an infinite number of copies of you, reading an infinite number of identical versions of this article.' Last year, scientists were able to create a map of light from when the universe was just 380,000 years old . Last year, scientists said that they had found the first 'hard evidence' that other universes exist. Cosmologists studying a map of the universe from data gathered by the Planck spacecraft concluded that it shows anomalies that can only have been caused by the gravitational pull of other universes. The map shows radiation from the Big Bang 13.8billion years ago that is still detectable in the universe - known as cosmic microwave radiation. Scientists had predicted that it should be evenly distributed, but the map shows a stronger concentration in the south half of the sky and a 'cold spot' that cannot be explained by current understanding of physics. Laura Mersini-Houghton, theoretical physicist at the University of North Carolina, said: ‘These anomalies were caused by other universes pulling on our universe as it formed during the Big Bang.’ A multiverse could resolve the dilemma in 'superstring' theory. At its most basic level, the theory describes all subatomic particles as vibrating filaments and membranes of energy. But string theory only works in ten or eleven dimensions and we only experience four .","On Monday, scientists discovered 'smoking gun' to expanding universe .

Just when it seemed West Ham’s bubble was about to burst and Mark Hughes would be handed three points on his birthday, Stewart Downing delivered two moments of quality to rescue a draw at Stoke. Hughes saw his team produce their best football this season and take a deserved two-goal lead. Victor Moses opened his account for Stoke in a fine display and Diouf score his fourth goal of the season. But they failed to hold on as Sam Allardyce made the changes that extend his side’s unbeaten run to four. While Stoke’s finishing ultimately cost them victory, their manager was furious at the decision by referee Chris Foy not to send off Alex Song as Enner Valencia scored to put West Ham back in the game.

Song dived in two-footed on Mame Biram Diouf and could have been dismissed but Downing broke with purpose and crossed brilliantly for the Ecuadorian to head home 22 seconds later. Hughes said: ‘I’m really disappointed with their first goal. Song dived in two-footed. Thankfully Mame Biram jumped out of the way but the referee should have stopped the game. It was a dangerous challenge. ‘It was potentially a red card because Song was out of control. He (Foy) is one of our senior referees so he’s got to be better than that.’ Asked whether the decision might have been different were the offending player from Stoke, Hughes replied: ‘I can’t say that. I can think it, maybe.’ Downing scored the equaliser himself 17 minutes from time with a driven right-foot shot to prove it is now more than simply a leg to stand on. Allardyce knew his side were fortunate to escape from the Britannia Stadium with a point. ‘I was glad it was only 1-0 at half-time,’ said Allardyce, whose team improved when Downing moved to the centre of midfield and Carlton Cole arrived from the bench to support Valencia up front. ‘That extra quality we’ve got this year paid dividends when it looked like we might not get a point. It was not necessarily well-deserved but shows the character of our team.’ West Ham slipped to fifth but maintain pace with the Champions League hunters in their best start since the 1999-2000 campaign. They were shorn of their most potent weapon in Diafra Sakho, who scored in each of his last seven games but failed to recover from a shoulder injury. Allardyce brought in Cheikhou Kouyate and left Valencia as his lone forward in a departure from the team that beat Manchester City last weekend. More cautious, it should have meant added stability in midfield but Stoke never allowed the visitors to settle. Early in the game, Bojan whipped a low centre from the right that Diouf, two yards out, would have scored from had he made the merest touch and in the 33rd minute Stoke went ahead.

To add to West Ham’s woes, Winston Reid was forced off with a thigh injury. Stoke could have been two-up in injury time.

"Mr Kennedy, who led the party between 1999 and 2006, died at his home in Fort William on Monday aged 55.
Following a post-mortem examination, his family issued a statement saying his unexpected death was ""a consequence of his battle with alcoholism"".
""Ultimately this was an illness Charles could not conquer despite all the efforts he and others made,"" they said.
Details of Mr Kennedy's funeral arrangements will be released in due course.
Mr Kennedy fought a long battle with alcoholism, which he first publicly revealed in 2006 when he stood down from the leadership of his party, just eight months after leading it to its best-ever performance at an election.
After his death was announced on Tuesday, the police said they did not believe there were any suspicious circumstances.

In their statement the family said the Procurator Fiscal's post-mortem report ""makes clear his (death) was a consequence of his battle with alcoholism"".
""We are grateful to the many friends and also medical experts who sought to help down the years but ultimately this was an illness Charles could not conquer despite all the efforts he and others made,"" they said said.
The family said they had been ""touched beyond measure by the outpouring of warmth"" from all parts of the country and all sides of politics following Mr Kennedy's death.
""The pain we feel has been at least eased somewhat by the reaction of so many people across Scotland, the UK and beyond, and by the affection expressed by politicians across the spectrum.
""It has become all too apparent to us how much Charles meant to so many people and how many lives he touched.""
Mr Kennedy's 10-year old son Donald and his ex-wife Sarah were in Parliament on Wednesday to listen to 90 minutes of tributes, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Labour leader Harriet Harman.
Many of the MPs who spoke addressed their comments to Donald, who was born during the 2005 general election, saying he could be rightly proud of how his father had conducted himself in his 32-year political career and the difference he had made.
What are the long-term effects of alcoholism?
By Philippa Roxby, BBC News health reporter
The effects of long-term alcohol addiction do not just affect the liver.
Drinking large amounts over many years will take its toll on other parts of the body, including the heart, pancreas, brain and nervous system.
Heavy drinking can increase blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels, which are both major risk factors for heart attacks and strokes. It can also weaken the immune system, increase the risk of a range of cancers and make people more prone to depression, dementia and infertility.
Drinkers at high risk of damaging their health are those drinking more than eight units of alcohol a day or 50 units a week, for men, and more than six units a day or 35 units a week, if you're a woman.
That's equivalent to several pints of strong lager or a bottle of wine every night. With no alcohol-free days to let the body recover between drinking, health problems will automatically begin to pile up.
But NHS Choices warns that alcohol can start to have a health impact at even lower levels - when drinking more than the recommended weekly amount of 21 units for men and 14 units for women.
Giving up alcohol when it has become a habit is not easy. Recognising there is a problem is often the first important step - but it is just the start. NHS Choices recommends going to see a GP and being honest about how much you drink, before trying to cut down gradually. Its website has more information on which organisations to contact for help.
The family's statement adds: ""The words and images of that day, and of so many other tributes, will be there for us to look back on with pride in Charles, and Donald will always know what a special father he had.""
Tony Blair's former communications director Alastair Campbell, who was a friend of Mr Kennedy's despite the two being on opposite sides over the Iraq War, said he hoped it would make politicians take alcoholism more seriously as an illness.
""None of us are surprised that alcoholism played a part in his tragic death but what has been great about the tributes is that they have focused on so much more than this.
""I hope that remains the case as people continue to remember him as we move towards the funeral and then subsequent memorials.
""I also hope that politicians of all parties develop a better understanding of alcoholism, take it more seriously and devise policies to treat it as a disease on a par with the other major diseases.""
And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said he hoped the days when people felt ""a little bit embarrassed"" to talk about such a personal issue in public were over.
""We need to remember Charles for all his achievements, not just how he died,"" he told the BBC News Channel. ""I hope we can also use this tragic moment to understand a little bit more about what alcoholism is and what it does to people.
""We need not to be ashamed of the illness, just like we would not be ashamed of any other illness, so that it allows people to be open and seek the help they need to deal with what is a terrible illness.""","Former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy died of a major haemorrhage linked to alcoholism, his family have said."
"Chicago-based United Airlines fired 13 flight attendants who refused to fly on a plane after ""someone had written threatening words and drawn menacing images"" on the aircraft near its tail, according to a complaint filed this week with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

 The 13 flight attendants from the July 14 San Francisco flight on a 747-400 aircraft bound for Hong Kong refused to fly, fearing a security threat. They claim they were fired improperly. 
  
 United spokeswoman Christen David said the airline will defend the litigation ""vigorously."" 
  
 ""Our flight operations, safety and maintenance teams appropriately investigated and determined there was no credible security threat,"" she said. The airline said all its safety procedures as well as those of the Federal Aviation Administration were followed, ""including a comprehensive safety sweep prior to boarding."" 
  
 ""The pilots, mechanics and safety leaders deemed the aircraft entirely safe to fly,"" she said. 
  
 The flight attendants refused to fly when the airline would not deplane passengers and conduct a security screening of the aircraft, according to the complaint filed Monday. They believed the potential threat, possibly an explosive, could endanger the lives of more than 300 passengers and crew, it said. The flight was ultimately canceled. 
  
 ""In the interest of maintaining its flight schedule at all costs, United first tried to bully the flight attendants into flying, and, when they refused to accede to company threats, accused them of 'insubordination' and fired them all,"" the complaint alleges. 
  
 The flight attendants' lawyer, David Marshall, a partner at Katz, Marshall & Banks, said: ""Our clients did exactly what the flying public would expect from a group of highly experienced airline professionals. ... Our clients are entitled to legal protection for doing what was right."" 
  
 The flight attendants allege their termination was a violation of a law that protects whistleblowers in the airline industry from retaliation for reporting air safety issues. 
  
 Together, the flight attendants had 299 years of experience, each with at least 18 years with United, according to the complaint.

"The 25th Oil and Gas Survey found 67% of north east Scotland businesses had shed staff at a faster rate than at any time in the survey's history.
But a similar proportion felt the sector had reached ""rock bottom"" and the rate of job cuts would now slow.
More than 40% had cut pay or changed benefits to cope with low oil prices.
The survey, conducted by Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce in partnership with the Fraser of Allander Institute, canvassed the views of 130 businesses, employing more than 308,000 UK staff in total.
The findings included:
James Bream, research and policy director at Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: ""We're likely to remain in an uncertain position through 2017 and 'the bottom' will arrive at different times and feel different for each company.
""It is clear that companies are striving to become fitter, leaner and they are working hard to look for new markets to secure their future and employment levels where that is within their control.
""There is no question of complacency in the north east and our brilliant people will continue to demonstrate that the oil and gas sector should be considered a success story in generating economic value for the UK economy.""
The survey was conducted in September.
Meanwhile, the UK's oil and gas industry has claimed chemical discharges to sea and emissions to the air have continued on a downward trend over the last 15 years.
Trade body Oil & Gas UK said the average oil-in-water concentration last year was less than half of the recommended limit set by the OSPAR Commission.
That was despite the industry's first increase in production since 2000.
The findings are contained in Oil & Gas UK's Environment Report 2016.
Mick Borwell, health, safety and environment policy director with Oil & Gas UK, said: ""The environment report comes at a challenging time for the UK oil and gas which is working extremely hard to navigate through the downturn, while maintaining environment and safety standards.
""Despite the UK Continental Shelf being a mature basin with technically challenging production, the overall trend for the last 15 years is downwards for discharges, emissions and accidental releases. Put simply, we are using the same amount of chemicals and emitting less CO2 in the production of more oil and gas.
""Industry is committed to minimising the effect on the natural environment and all operators have an environmental management system which is designed to minimise environmental effect.""","More than two thirds of oil and gas firms cut jobs last year - but there are signs the crisis may be approaching a turning point, a survey has found."
"GOP Health Plan Would Leave 23 Million More Uninsured, Budget Office Says 
  
 Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images 
  
 The revised Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will leave 23 million more people uninsured in 2026 than if that act, also known as Obamacare, were to remain in place. The GOP bill would also reduce the deficit by $119 billion over 10 years. 
  
 That's what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported Wednesday in its latest score of the American Health Care Act. The CBO's assessment shows that the deficit would fall and premiums would fall for some Americans, but the report also raises potential concerns about the bill. The agency reports that the bill could destabilize individual insurance markets in some states, leaving unhealthy Americans unable to buy insurance. 
  
 The bill will now move on to the Senate, and should it pass that chamber, it will not look like this current AHCA version. As NPR's Susan Davis reported Wednesday, the Senate is likely to write its own version of the bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also told Reuters he doesn't know what that path to passing the bill will look like. 
  
 ""I don't know how we get to 50 [votes] at the moment. But that's the goal,"" he said. 
  
 A smaller deficit, but a far higher uninsured rate 
  
 The $119 billion deficit reduction represents a decline from previous versions. When the CBO first scored the AHCA, it said the plan would save $337 billion over 10 years. Later revisions reduced those savings to $150 billion. 
  
 By far the biggest savings would come from Medicaid, which serves low-income Americans. That program would face $834 billion in cuts. Cutbacks in subsidies for individual health insurance would likewise help cut $276 billion. But those are offset in large part by bigger costs, including the repeal of many of Obamacare's taxes. 
  
 Those tax cuts would overwhelmingly benefit the highest-income Americans, the Tax Policy Center, a Washington think tank, reported on Wednesday. 
  
 The increase in the number of uninsured is also slightly lower than in the CBO's initial estimate. That report estimated that 24 million fewer would be insured in 2026 if this bill were to become law, putting the uninsured rate at around 18.6 percent. This revised bill would reduce that by around 1 million — a difference of less than half a percentage point. 
  
 In contrast, the uninsured rate in 2026 would be around 10 percent under Obamacare, the CBO reports. 
  
 More than half of that increase in the uninsured — 14 million — would come from reduced Medicaid enrollment. 
  
 The CBO also notes that the AHCA could mean some Americans would buy policies that don't cover ""major medical risks."" Because of those policies' skimpy coverage, the CBO doesn't count those people as insured in this report. 
  
 The Trump administration responded by saying it believes the CBO's numbers are unreliable. 
  
 ""History has proven the CBO to be totally incapable of accurately predicting how healthcare legislation will impact health insurance coverage,"" the White House said in a statement. 
  
 The CBO did indeed far overestimate the number of people who would sign up for the Obamacare exchanges, as FactCheck.org's Brooks Jackson wrote in March. Likewise, it undershot on the number of Medicaid enrollees. (That said, Jackson added, the CBO predicted the uninsured rate relatively closely.) 
  
 Difficulties for some addicted, pregnant or sick Americans 
  
 The act could make obtaining health care coverage prohibitively expensive for some sicker Americans, the CBO found. 
  
 That's because under the AHCA, states could get waivers exempting them from some Obamacare provisions, including what are called essential health benefits — a list of basics like mental health and prescription drugs that the Affordable Care Act required plans to cover. States could also get waivers that allow insurers to charge more for people with pre-existing conditions. 
  
 One challenge the CBO faced in creating these estimates was figuring out how many states would get those waivers, and the report acknowledges that this creates some uncertainty in the estimates. In the end, it estimated that around one-sixth of the population lives in states that would seek both of those waivers. Around half of Americans live in states that would seek no waivers, meanwhile, and the remainder live in states that would make ""moderate"" changes. 
  
 In states that obtained both of those waivers, it would mean lower premiums for people buying individual insurance. But less healthy Americans in those states could face ""extremely high premiums,"" the report said. 
  
 ""Over time, it would become more difficult for less healthy people (including people with preexisting medical conditions) in those states to purchase insurance because their premiums would continue to increase rapidly,"" the CBO wrote. 
  
 Waiving essential health benefits could also make medical care much more expensive for people who are pregnant, addicted or have other mental health issues and who live in those states that waive those benefits. 
  
 ""In particular, out-of-pocket spending on maternity care and mental health and substance abuse services could increase by thousands of dollars in a given year for the nongroup enrollees who would use those services,"" the report says of people living in those states. 
  
 Under current law, the CBO wrote, the markets will be ""stable in most areas"" because lower-income Americans buying individual insurance will be shielded from rising Obamacare premiums, thanks to subsidies. 
  
 However, the report acknowledges that insurers have reduced their participation in the exchanges, leaving some Americans with no options for buying insurance. ""The Affordable Care Act doesn't have a back-up plan for this situation,"" as Vox's Sarah Kliff and Sarah Frostenson reported Wednesday, so it's not clear how this could play out. 
  
 Cuts to Medicaid 
  
 Medicaid accounts for by far the biggest spending reductions under the American Health Care Act. The bill would roll back the Medicaid expansion instituted under the Affordable Care Act, which extended the program to cover some Americans with incomes up to 133 percent of the poverty line. That expansion increased enrollment by 10 million, as NPR's Alison Kodjak previously reported. Rolling back that expansion would limit future enrollments. 
  
 The AHCA would also give states a choice: Receive Medicaid funding via either a block grant or a per capita amount per enrollee. 
  
 Together, these changes would create major cuts in enrollment for the program: 14 million fewer people by 2026, and $834 billion in spending cuts over a decade. 
  
 Older, lower-income Americans get higher premiums 
  
 Average premiums would be lower in 2026 than they would be under Obamacare, both in states that do and that don't seek waivers. But it's impossible to make a meaningful blanket statement about how premiums would change under this bill, as those changes differ vastly for different groups of people. 
  
 For example, older Americans who make little money and buy individual insurance would see their premiums climb far beyond what they would be under Obamacare. A 64-year-old making $26,500 would pay $1,700 in premiums annually under Obamacare. In a state making those ""moderate"" changes to its market, that 64-year-old would pay $13,600, and in a state with no waivers, the cost would be $16,100. That's more than nine times that person's premium under the Affordable Care Act. 
  
 However, younger Americans would see little change in their premiums, or even declines. Likewise, some people with higher incomes could see substantially lower premiums under this bill. For example, a 40-year-old paying $6,500 a year under current law could pay an estimated $2,100 in a state with ""moderate changes"" to its market. 
  
 The bill moves on to the Senate 
  
 The CBO's newly estimated deficit savings mean the bill can safely move on to the Senate. 
  
 The future of the bill hinged upon this report, as House Republicans passed their most recent version of the bill without waiting for the CBO to report its estimated price tag. Three weeks after passing the bill, however, they have not sent the bill on to the Senate yet, because they were waiting on this score. Budget rules dictate that if the bill's deficit savings had not reached $2 billion (and that $2 billion had to come from particular spending categories), the bill would be dead upon arrival. ||||| Republicans’ American Health Care Act would be devastating to older Americans who rely on the individual insurance market, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. 
  
 The CBO found that the revised Republican bill does bring down overall premiums in the individual market by anywhere from 4 to 20 percent by 2026 compared with what they would be under current law. 
  
 The variation depends on whether a state accepts waivers under the American Health Care Act, which would allow insurers to offer much skimpier health plans at lower premiums. States that take up such waivers would see lower premiums, although the health plans would provide fewer benefits. States that don’t adopt such waivers would have higher premiums, but their health plans would offer more benefits — a trade-off. 
  
 But the CBO’s analysis includes a big caveat: Premiums would differ greatly based on age and income. In general, the older and poorer you are, the higher your premiums would be under the American Health Care Act compared with current law. 
  
 The CBO offers an example of a single individual with an annual income of $26,500. 
  
 If that person is 21 years old, he could benefit from the Republican health care bill. Under the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), he would on average pay $1,700 in premiums for insurance. Under the Republican plan, he would pay $1,250 if he’s in a state that accepts regulatory waivers and makes moderate changes to market rules — although, again, this also means his health plan would likely be skimpier. If his state doesn’t take up a waiver, his premium would actually increase by $50 to $1,750. 
  
 But if that person is 64 years old, he would be hurt by the Republican bill. Under Obamacare, he would also pay $1,700 in premiums for insurance. But under the Republican bill, he would pay $16,100 (about 60 percent of his annual income) if he lives in a state that doesn’t accept regulatory waivers, and $13,600 — still more than half his annual income — if he lives in a state that does adopt waivers to make moderate rule changes. That amounts to as much as an 850 percent increase in premiums from Obamacare to the Republican bill. 
  
 A 64-year-old who’s making $68,200 a year could fare a bit better. Under Obamacare, he’s expected to pay $15,300 in premiums for insurance, because his income would be too high to receive the law’s tax credits. Under the Republican bill, the tax credit, which is now based on age instead of income, begins phasing out at $75,000. So his premium would drop to $13,600 — a bit below Obamacare levels — in a state that gets a regulatory waiver but would actually increase to $16,100 in a state that doesn’t get a waiver. 
  
 Here’s how all of that looks in chart form: 
  
 Older people with an annual income of $75,000 or more would get fewer to no subsidies under the Republican bill. So they would likely face higher premiums than they did under Obamacare, much like the lower-income consumer. 
  
 The Republican bill accomplishes all of this in two ways. 
  
 First, it abandons Obamacare’s income-based tax credits (which give more money to people with lower incomes) to instead give anyone with an annual salary below $75,000 a tax credit based on age, with older people getting more money and a phaseout for higher incomes. 
  
 But it also peels back an Obamacare rule that protects older people from higher premiums. Under Obamacare, insurers are generally only allowed to charge an older person about three times what they would charge a younger person — under the theory that older people are often sicker and therefore need to use more insurance. But under the Republican bill, the limit of three times would go up to five times, effectively letting insurers charge older people 66 percent more than they would under Obamacare. 
  
 Republicans argue this is necessary because it would also let insurers charge younger people less, which would encourage younger and generally healthier people to come into the insurance pool — and therefore bring down the overall cost of health care by making it so more younger, healthier people are effectively subsidizing everyone’s care. 
  
 The CBO found that’s broadly true: It would bring insurance premiums down in general, and it would cost at least some young people less to get signed up for a health plan. But it would do all of that at a very high cost to older, particularly poorer Americans. ||||| (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) 
  
 Health-care legislation adopted by House Republicans earlier this month would leave 23 million more Americans uninsured by 2026 than under current law, the Congressional Budget Office projected Wednesday — only a million fewer than the estimate for the House’s previous bill. 
  
 The nonpartisan agency’s finding, which drew immediate fire from Democrats, patient advocates, health industry officials and some business groups, is likely to complicate Republicans’ push to pass a companion bill in the Senate. 
  
 The new score, which reflects last-minute revisions that Republicans made to win over several conservative lawmakers and a handful of moderates, calculates that the American Health Care Act would reduce the federal deficit by $119 billion between 2017 and 2026. That represents a smaller reduction than the $150 billion CBO estimated in late March, largely because House leaders provided more money in their final bill to offset costs for consumers with expensive medical conditions and included language that could translate to greater federal spending on health insurance subsidies. 
  
 [What is in the Republican health-care bill? Questions and answers on preexisting conditions, Medicaid and more.] 
  
 As GOP senators quickly distanced themselves from the updated numbers, what became apparent is the difficult balancing act congressional leaders face as they seek to rewrite large portions of the Affordable Care Act. Some senators are eager to soften portions of the House bill, including cuts to entitlement programs and provisions that would allow insurers in individual states to offer fewer benefits in their health plans or to charge consumers with costly medical conditions higher premiums. 
  
  
  
  
  
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who did not issue a statement in response to the new budget score, suggested in an interview with Reuters that he still harbored doubts over whether his party could muster enough votes to pass any kind of health-care bill this year. 
  
 “I don’t know how we get to 50 [votes] at the moment,” he said, referring to a situation in which Vice President Pence would cast the deciding vote. “But that’s the goal.” 
  
 To avoid a filibuster by Democrats, Senate Republicans plan to take the bill up under budget reconciliation rules — which only require a majority vote but mean the legislation cannot increase the federal deficit within a 10-year window. The Republicans have been working for weeks on their own health-care bill and emphasize that they do not intend to simply follow the House’s lead. 
  
 “Exactly what the composition of [our legislation] is, I’m not going to speculate about because it serves no purpose,” McConnell told Reuters. 
  
 Some, like Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), said the CBO score would have no impact on his chamber’s efforts to write its own bill. 
  
 [The three numbers you need to understand the CBO report on Republicans’ health-care bill] 
  
 “Regardless of any CBO score, it’s no secret Obamacare is collapsing under its own weight,” Perdue said in a statement. “Doing nothing is not an option.” 
  
 Instead of addressing the future number of uninsured Americans under the Republican plan — projected to immediately jump in 2018 by 14 million — House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) on Wednesday chose to focus on the CBO’s estimate that premiums overall would fall under the AHCA. 
  
 “This CBO report again confirms that the American Health Care Act achieves our mission: lowering premiums and lowering the deficit,” Ryan said in a statement. “It is another positive step toward keeping our promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.” 
  
 Congressional analysts concluded that one change to the House bill aimed at lowering premiums, by allowing states to opt out of some current insurance requirements, would encourage some employers to maintain coverage for their workers and get younger, healthier people to buy plans on their own. But those gains would be largely offset by consumers with preexisting conditions, who would face higher premiums than they do now. 
  
 “Their premiums would continue to increase rapidly,” the report found. 
  
 The CBO estimated that states seeking waivers to strip the ACA’s “essential health benefits” would affect roughly one-sixth of the population and that obtaining maternity coverage outside a basic plan, for example, “could be more than $1,000 per month.” 
  
 But Rep. John Faso (R-N.Y.), who supported the House bill, called the CBO’s assumption that waivers would affect that many Americans “grossly wrong.” 
  
 “Frankly I doubt any state would try to take advantage of that provision,” he said. “I think that is completely out of the ballpark.” 
  
 Asked why the House included the provision if no state would seek such waivers, he replied, “I’m sure it will be stripped out in the Senate.” 
  
 The administration’s reaction came from Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who questioned the congressional analysts’ latest numbers while noting that many Americans on the individual insurance market are paying more than double the premiums they were before the ACA was passed in 2010. 
  
 “The CBO was wrong when they analyzed Obamacare’s effect on cost and coverage, and they are wrong again,” Price said.

 Joseph Antos, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who specializes in health-care policy, said the new estimate “is the same signal repeated,” conveying that the changes congressional Republicans envision would cut the price of premiums and trim the deficit while leaving more Americans without insurance. 
  
 The AHCA’s proposal to cut spending on Medicaid — a federal program that covers roughly 69 million Americans — by $834 billion over the next decade is the thorniest political issue facing the Senate, Antos said. 
  
 “They’re going to have to do something on Medicaid, and that something is a real question,” he said. 
  
 Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he was confident the Senate would be able to craft a bill that could pass muster in the House — even in light of the CBO’s analysis. 
  
 He said that he expected senators to address the situation of the roughly 10 million Americans who now enjoy Medicaid coverage under the ACA “in a less conservative way” than the House and that the measure “would still have conservative support in the House when it came back.” 
  
 Senate Democrats seized on the new budget estimate, arguing that their GOP counterparts would be foolhardy to press ahead along the same lines as the House’s final legislation. The bill was passed May 4 with no support from Democrats. 
  
 “These were cosmetic changes. They thought they could put lipstick on a pig,” said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), adding that it’s now obvious “we’re going to have well over 20 million people uninsured.” 
  
 Several key outside groups, including those representing physicians, hospitals and patients, said in statements that the updated projections underscored the need for the Senate to shift course. 
  
 The president of the American Medical Association urged the Senate to take a different approach. The CBO estimates “show that last-minute changes to the AHCA made by the House offered no real improvements,” Andrew Gurman said. 
  
 And Rick Pollack, president and chief executive of the American Hospital Association, said the new numbers “only reinforce our deep concerns about the importance of maintaining coverage for those vulnerable patients who need it.” 
  
 Mike DeBonis and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report. |||||","– The American Health Care Act passed by House Republicans earlier this month will reduce the deficit by $119 billion over the next decade—while leaving 23 million more Americans without insurance than if ObamaCare remains in place, according to the Congressional Budget Office's score of the bill released Wednesday. NPR reports that while premiums could go down for some people under the AHCA, the CBO warns of ""extremely high premiums"" for people with preexisting conditions. Insurance could also be thousands of dollars more expensive for people who are pregnant or have issues with addiction or mental health. The AHCA would reduce the deficit by cutting Medicaid by $884 billion and subsidies for individual health insurance by $276 billion. Whether or not insurance premiums go up for Americans under the AHCA depends partly on what state they live in. The AHCA allows for states to get waivers that would lower premiums by allowing cheaper plans that don't cover ""major medical risks."" But it also largely depends on age, as Vox explains. A 64-year-old making $26,500 a year would pay between $13,600 and $16,100 for insurance under the AHCA, depending on if their state gets waivers. That's up from $1,700 under ObamaCare. A 64-year-old making $68,200 would also see their premiums increase if they live in a state that doesn't get the waivers. That's because the AHCA allows insurers to charge older people up to five times as much as younger people. The Washington Post reports the Senate is unlikely to pass the AHCA as it stands and is working on its own bill."
"London (CNN) -- It's a classic family scene. The proud parents showing off their new baby in the garden. A doting grandpa snapping photographs. Fine for Facebook or Instagram. But when the baby in question is the future British king, and the photos are the first official photos, it doesn't take long for the world to weigh in -- on their quality, no less. Most seem to agree that Michael Middleton, father of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and granddad to Prince George of Cambridge, should leave royal photography to the professionals. ""They are lovely snaps for a grandfather to have taken. But in terms of the quality, they are not really what you want for such a historic picture"" is the verdict of Eddie Mulholland, vice chairman of the British Press Photographers Association and a photographer for the Daily Telegraph. The Daily Mail describes Catherine and Prince William's decision to use ""one of proud grandpa Mike's happy family snaps"" as ""a startling break with tradition."" Most criticism zeroed in on the focus and the lighting -- always a challenge for amateur photographers not equipped with fancy flashes or reflectors. Prince William and Catherine, the latter holding Prince George swaddled in a white blanket, are posed on the lawn of her parents' home in Berkshire with the sun behind them, a difficult shot to pull off. ""I guess the reason Kate's father chose backlight was to avoid bright sun on little George,"" speculates the Mirror's royal photographer, Kent Gavin. He's happy to share some advice though. ""Back-lighting is always a little tricky for the non-professionals but it does give a nice result. Photographing against the sun needs a fill-in flash. Another option would be to use an area in shade away from harsh light."" His other tip? ""My professional view would be to see more of baby George."" 'Babies, happy parents and dogs all bring smiles' The inclusion of the family pets -- the Cambridges' cocker spaniel Lupo and the Middletons' golden retriever Tilly -- in some of the snaps also gets a mixed reception. A reporter for The Times of London remarked that the official photographs came ""in a choice of formats: with or without dogs."" Mulholland, of the Telegraph, was more scathing. ""The photograph with the dogs is the worst. One of the dogs in the corner looks like a furry rug,"" he wrote. But the pictures got a more favorable write-up from some CNN readers who commented on the story. ""Babies, happy parents and dogs all bring smiles and the world needs more smiles!"" said Earlypro. ""Its nice to see a family snap and not a professional one. Its a special time with a new baby I hope the press backs off and let them enjoy it,"" wrote Ann. The public also weighed in on Twitter. ""Who cares? The photos are beautiful and show a new family! I think it's great that 'Grandad' got to take the photos,"" tweeted MammaMia, a mother of two from the English West Midlands. ""I'm no royal watcher, but love choice new family made to release photos snapped by baby George grampa. Can u blame them?"" posted @MemoryMan Studios, a portrait studio in Dublin, Ireland. No 'feeling of grandeur' However, John Keatley, an editorial and celebrity photographer in Seattle, told CNN that taking such informal pictures jars the royal ""brand."" ""The amateur image that these photos put across certainly doesn't create the most grand or royal image in the viewer's mind,"" he said. ""They're decent photos. They're not terrible. But at the same time, they certainly don't have the same shine and pop and feeling of grandeur that you often see from official royal family photos."" He acknowledged that the family may have been trying to project a casual, informal image. But, he added, ""You can still make it casual. But this is just casual and poor quality. They didn't have to make a bad quality product to put that idea across."" Christopher Barr, a professional photographer in Arizona, agrees. ""It's obvious that a professional didn't take these. It hasn't been color-corrected. Even somebody with a modicum of Photoshop knowledge could improve these pictures immeasurably,"" he said. ""It's not a very good effort. It's a particularly poor effort given that he's taking pictures of such an important thing at such an important time."" But Lana Marks, a friend of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, told CNN's ""AC360"" show that she thinks William's mother would have been delighted by his approach. ""One of the things she told me is that she so much wanted William to have a normal life with his family in the future, with whoever he wed and had children with,"" she said. ""All of her dreams have come true and her legacy's coming true, and all the influences she's had on William, the normalcy, is showing through so greatly now. She would be immensely happy.""

"Scores of people were killed and at least 123 others were wounded Wednesday in shootings and explosions across Iraq, senior Interior Ministry officials said. Five bombings in the Iraqi capital were responsible for dozens of the casualties, Baghdad police officials said. Three of the Baghdad bombings happened in the morning, killing at least 25 people near checkpoints for entry into the city's International Zone, a heavily fortified area that houses Iraqi government offices and the U.S. and British embassies. In the deadliest blast, a suicide bomber targeted a security checkpoint near the International Zone, Iraqi Interior Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Saad Maan Ibrahim said. Police officials said the bomber struck a restaurant that is frequented by Iraqis going into the International Zone, which is also called the Green Zone. The second blast occurred near the entrance to Iraq's Foreign Ministry building. Police and residents said a car bomb exploded in a parking lot opposite the building, and the Interior Ministry said it was a suicide bombing. The third explosion took place in the Al-Sanak area of Baghdad, one of the capital's main commercial areas. Police officials did not give a breakdown of how many people were killed and injured in each blast. Conflicting accounts have emerged, with initial reports from security sources indicating all three of the morning blasts were car bombings. In the evening, two car bombs exploded near a busy commercial area in southeastern Baghdad, killing at least 10 people and injuring 24 others, police said. And a roadside bomb and a car bomb exploded at a coffee shop and a restaurant in al-Dora in southern Baghdad. It killed four people and wounded 16 others, police officials told CNN. In southwestern Mosul, in northern Iraq, a car bomb exploded outside the Turkish consulate, wounding five Iraqi security forces at a checkpoint outside the consulate, two senior Interior Ministry officials said. In western Mosul, gunmen targeted Um al-Rabiein police station, the officials said. The attack started when a suicide bomber drove a bomb-rigged vehicle to the main checkpoint of the police station and exploded. That was followed by rocket-propelled grenade and small-arms fire, they said. At least five people were killed, four of them police officers, and 23 were wounded, 14 of them police. Also in western Mosul, a car bomb exploded at an Iraqi army convoy, killing three soldiers and wounding eight people, four of them soldiers, the officials said. The United Nations' special representative in Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov, condemned the violence. ""Those who orchestrate such attacks should be condemned by all political, religious and civic leaders in this country,"" he said in a prepared statement. ""Iraq political leaders should show national unity in dealing with such threats and unite against terrorism."" Iraq's Foreign Ministry has been targeted in the past. The worst attack was in August 2009, when it was hit by a suicide truck bomb and dozens of staff were killed and injured. Another government building, the Transport Ministry, was attacked by gunmen last week. The militants seized part of the building and took civil servants hostage before security forces drove them out. Also Wednesday, a car bombing in the northern city of Mosul killed two bodyguards of a member of Iraq's Parliament, police said. The blast happened outside the eastern Mosul house of Wisal Salim, a Sunni Muslim lawmaker. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with almost 8,000 people killed, most of them civilians. The figures remained grim in January. According to the U.N. mission in Iraq, 618 civilians and 115 members of the country's security forces were killed. The U.N. tally does not include those killed in a fresh wave of violence in Iraq's Anbar province, west of Baghdad, where al Qaeda-backed militants and Iraqi security forces have been fighting since the end of last year. The ongoing violence in Anbar, Salaheddin and Nineveh Sunni provinces has raised concerns among some observers that parliamentary elections scheduled for April 30 will be delayed.

"U.S. authorities are watching warily but have made no new plans to protect travelers during the busy Thanksgiving week despite threats from Islamic State to strike targets in New York and Washington, two law enforcement officials said Friday. 
  
 The deadly rampage in Paris and the bombing of a Russian passenger jet in the last three weeks have put U.S. law enforcement and aviation security on heightened alert for another possible terrorist attack. 
  
 But U.S. intelligence officials have seen no indications of credible plots in the works beyond the bellicose videos and other rhetoric posted online by Islamic State militants. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal assessments. 
  
 ""The threat level continues to be the same as it was last month,"" said Ali Soufan, a former FBI agent who worked on terrorism cases and now runs a security consulting firm in New York. 
  
 After a bomb brought down a Russian Metrojet flight over the Sinai Peninsula on Oct. 31, killing 224 people, the Transportation Security Administration rolled out stricter screening requirements in overseas airports that are the last point of departure for U.S.-bound flights. 
  
 ""As the investigation and our own review of the crash proceeds, we will continually assess our aviation security enhancements, and consider whether additional changes are appropriate,"" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said at the time. 
  
 Russian officials confirmed this week that the jetliner had been blown apart by a homemade bomb with the explosive power of two pounds of TNT smuggled on board. 
  
 In a video released Thursday, Islamic State operatives threatened to launch an attack on New York City and showed images of Herald Square and Times Square. In response, Mayor Bill de Blasio said there is no specific and credible threat, and the city ""would not be intimidated."" 
  
 The New York Police Department this week deployed the first 100 officers of a long-planned force of about 500 anti-terrorism officers called the Critical Response Command. The new force is headquartered on Randalls Island on the East River in order to have quick access to three of the city's five boroughs. 
  
 A separate video released by Islamic State militants in Iraq after the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris warned of attacks in Washington. But security already is tight in the nation's capital. 
  
 Al Qaeda, which was responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks, has sought to launch an attack on American soil since the 1990s. It's most lethal offshoot, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in Yemen, has repeatedly sought to bring down U.S. airliners. 
  
 Islamic State, which now has eclipsed Al Qaeda, recently shifted its attention from seizing and controlling territory in Syria and Iraq, its self-declared caliphate, to actively plotting attacks against its foreign enemies, especially France, Russia and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. 
  
 Counter-terrorism officials warn that the United States could be next on the list. 
  
 ""Do they have the intention? Yes. Problem is, do they have the capability?"" Soufan said. 
  
 The current intelligence assessments are in contrast to security alerts issued shortly before the Fourth of July weekend. At the time, U.S. security agencies picked up intelligence suggesting possible attacks and urged local police to be vigilant during parades, concerts and fireworks displays. 
  
 An estimated 25.3 million Americans will board an airplane in the 12 days around Thanksgiving, according to Airlines for America, an airline trade association. That's 3% more than last year's holiday season and the highest number of passengers since 2007. 
  
 Each year, the holiday season stretches the capacity of airport screeners at the TSA. They face the challenge of preventing weapons and explosives from being taken on jets without delaying passengers. 
  
 During the 2010 Thanksgiving travel crush, passengers faced intrusive pat-downs and body scans following a foiled attempt by Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen to hide makeshift bombs inside printer cartridges carried in the hold of passenger jets bound for Chicago. 
  
 The pat-downs have since been scaled back in favor of new aviation security systems, including additional database checks of travel histories, more robust screening of cargo and baggage overseas, and other measures.

Travelers, as usual, are being asked to report any suspicious activities to police. 
  
 Railway passengers nationwide will also see a significant increase in security. 
  
 Amtrak says it is working with local, state and federal law enforcement to gather intelligence and establish robust security measures not just at the stations, but on trains and along the tracks. 
  
 An Amtrak spokesperson tells ABC News additional K9, uniform personnel and long guns have been deployed at various points of Amtrak’s service and employees have been debriefed with guidance regarding active shooter incidents. 
  
 The Transportation Security Administration is not divulging specifics beyond the ordinary, but says it has measures in place, both seen and unseen, to protect the millions of Americans traveling nationwide. 
  
 Passengers at busy airports such as LaGuardia and JFK in New York can expect longer waits, even with additional staffing at checkpoints. 
  
 According to TSA officials, the security administration screens nearly 2 million passengers daily and on the days leading up to Thanksgiving that number is expected to increase nearly 40 percent nationwide. That influx would spell the busiest travel season in its history. 
  
 Significant additional layers of security are routine during the American holiday season, but the recent events in France are sure to contribute. 
  
 ABC News' Erin Dooley contributed to this report. |||||","– Officials say there are no specific threats to Americans over the Thanksgiving holiday, but travelers can expect heightened security and extra delays regardless. The Los Angeles Times cites two anonymous law enforcement officials, who say there are no additional security measures being put in place for holiday travelers to address recent Islamic State videos threatening attacks on New York City and Washington DC. Experts have deemed those threats not credible. However the officials note law enforcement and aviation security are already on heightened alert following the attacks in Paris and the destruction of a Russian passenger jet over Egypt. ABC News reports travelers can expect extra layers of security at airports and train stations—typical during any holiday season. There will be increased patrols at airports, tunnels, trains stations, and more in New York City. And Amtrak is deploying additional security personnel at various locations. Officials say the extra measures are necessary because of the high number of travelers over Thanksgiving. According to the Times, an estimated 25.3 million Americans will fly somewhere next week—the most since 2007."
"It may be one of the most-quoted lines in American literature -- and if you dare to quote it, you might have to pay. In late October, Faulkner Literary Rights -- which represents Nobel Prize-winning author William Faulkner's estate -- sued representatives of Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" for misquoting the famous line, ""The past is never dead. It's not even past."" In the film, about a writer who travels back in time to 1920s Paris, Owen Wilson's character lightly rephrases the line as ""The past is not dead. Actually, it's not even past."" For the film's sin, Faulkner's estate is suing for copyright infringement and asking for ""damages, disgorgement of profits, costs and attorney fees,"" according to the suit. Defendant Sony Pictures Classics, which released ""Midnight in Paris,"" quickly fired back. Last living Faulkner talks about 'Pappy' ""This is a frivolous lawsuit and we are confident we will prevail in defending it,"" the studio said in a statement, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Sony is defending the quotation as a ""fair use"" under copyright law, which is a defense that lets others freely reproduce copyrighted works for purposes such as criticism, comment and news reporting. Woody Allen had no comment, his publicist told CNN. But Lee Caplin, executor of the Faulkner estate, believes the movie went over the line in its use of the quotation, which comes from Faulkner's 1950 work ""Requiem for a Nun."" He points out that ""Midnight in Paris"" is a commercial enterprise, the line was important to the film and Allen or Sony should have asked permission. Ron Howard asked and received permission (for a fee) from the estate to use a Faulkner quotation in a Howard-produced TV series, he says, and Sony or Allen could have easily done the same. ""I don't think Woody is any less knowledgeable than Ron Howard,"" says Caplin, a lawyer and movie producer. ""I think Woody's in the motion-picture business. It's called a business because you make a movie that sells tickets. ... When you attach Faulkner to your product, you're enhancing that product. You're enhancing it for artistic reasons, but you're mostly enhancing it for the entertaining business reasons of why you make a product more appealing."" Moreover, he adds, ""If Woody could have written something better, I'm sure he would have."" But Neville Johnson, an entertainment lawyer who specializes in copyright and fair use, thinks the Faulkner estate is grasping. The quote is short, for one thing -- nine words, a tiny fraction of ""Requiem for a Nun."" ""You're telling me one sentence gets you a copyright infringement action? I don't think so,"" he says. Caplin disagreed with that line of thinking. ""It puzzles me that people think size matters,"" he says. In addition, copyright infringement comes into play if it can damage the ""potential market"" of the original work. ""I guess the book will never sell another copy, don't you think?"" Johnson thundered mockingly. ""It's all over for Faulkner!"" Looking backward with the bard of Oxford . Of all the writers to be involved in a copyright infringement lawsuit, William Faulkner would seem one of the least likely. The bard of Oxford, Mississippi, is known for colorfully evocative novels about a murky post-Civil War Southern landscape, which -- though rewarding -- are often the kinds of books forced on unsuspecting high school students. His writing isn't exactly pithy: He's been listed in Guinness World Records for constructing a record-setting 1,288-word sentence (in ""Absalom, Absalom!""). Some of his best known works, such as ""The Sound and the Fury"" and ""Intruder in the Dust,"" are noted for their thickets of stream-of-consciousness storytelling. For many years, the Faux Faulkner Contest honored scribblers who attempted to reproduce the master's rhythmic prose, tormented Southern characters, and endless comma-strung clauses (with parenthetical asides). Faulkner was no stranger to Hollywood himself, signing a series of contracts in the '30s and '40s to write for various studios. He was credited with six screenplays, including the adaptations of Ernest Hemingway's ""To Have and Have Not"" and Raymond Chandler's ""The Big Sleep."" His love-hate relationship with the movies was parodied in the Coen brothers' film ""Barton Fink"" through the character of W.P. Mayhew, a hard-drinking Southerner hailed by the title character as ""the finest novelist of our time."" Touring the South's literary landmarks . Indeed, Faulkner is considered a titan of American literature, often evoked with Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald among a trio of pre-World War II greats. His words -- particularly the ones approximated in ""Midnight in Paris"" -- still echo, says Jay Watson, the Howry Chair of Faulkner Studies at (where else?) the University of Mississippi. ""It describes themes in American history, and I think that's one of the reasons why that line has had such resonance,"" he says. Faulkner's line is haunting and backward-looking, a warning that we forget our tangled roots at our peril -- a sentiment not often expressed in this country, he points out. ""As a culture, the U.S. is pretty forward-looking and youth-oriented,"" Watson says, ""and we very often tend to have a sharper eye on our future than on the past."" A 'very gray area' In a way, it's looking backward that's the nub of the lawsuit. Artists routinely stand on the shoulders of their predecessors, channeling ideas through their personal lenses. Done creatively, it can provide whole new meanings to the original source. Francis Ford Coppola used Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" as the basis for ""Apocalypse Now""; Conrad, in turn, relied on Dante's ""Inferno."" Faulkner's books, too, are full of references to other works, particularly the King James Bible and Shakespeare's plays (which are both in the public domain). ""He even said, at moments when he was asked to give advice to young writers, that there's an element of artistic creation that is glorified stealing,"" says Watson. ""In order to be bold and ambitious as an artist, you have to be willing to use whatever you find wherever you may find it."" Other artists have made frequent use of Faulkner. The Faulkner Institute at Southeast Missouri State University maintains a page of ""Faulkner sightings."" Of course, when done less than creatively, it provides openings for the attorneys -- and in our remix-happy society, full of self-produced videos and sampled music, there's a fine line between creativity and copyright infringement (or, for that matter, outright piracy). YouTube alone is full of ripped-off video files and audio tracks, says Johnson. ""It's a morass out there of violations across the board,"" he says. But it is sometimes hard to determine when the line is crossed. Artists and their estates have sued in the past when they believed their copyrights were being infringed upon. In 2001, Margaret Mitchell's estate sued author Alice Randall and publisher Houghton Mifflin over Randall's ""The Wind Done Gone,"" a parody of ""Gone With the Wind"" told from the point of view of a slave. That case was eventually settled out of court, though an appeals court had upheld Randall's right to create the book. Fair use is a ""very gray area,"" says Julie Ahrens, who runs the Fair Use Project at Stanford University's Center for Internet and Society. ""There are lots of things that are not clear."" ""I get things where people are like, 'Are you sure I can do this?' And the best I can say is, 'Yes, you should be able to,' "" she says. However, she doesn't see a problem with ""Midnight in Paris"" and ""the past is not dead."" Besides, the phrase has been used many times before -- in news headlines, TV shows and song lyrics. President Obama even used the line in perhaps the most famous speech of the 2008 campaign, known as ""A More Perfect Union,"" which he delivered in response to the controversy involving his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Obama's speech chronicled the challenges of race in America, and also misquoted Faulkner: ""The past isn't dead and buried. In fact, it isn't even past,"" Obama said. ""The idea that one person can control the use of those particular words seems ridiculous to me,"" says Ahrens. ""Any of kind of literary allusion is ordinarily celebrated. This seems to squarely fall in that tradition."" It seems like a lot of effort over a few words -- this case of the estate of a long-dead author going up against a multibillion-dollar Hollywood conglomerate. But the impact can be deep. Ahrens is worried about a chilling effect; Caplin is hoping that a brighter line can be introduced in the dim area of fair use. It's nothing personal, he adds. He loved ""Midnight in Paris."" As executor, he's just looking out for the fiduciary responsibilities of the Faulkner estate, and he's willing to let a jury decide the merits of the copyright case. ""I'd love to have Woody Allen come down and have a free tour of (Faulkner's house) Rowan Oak,"" he says. ""But if he wants to use any more of Mr. Faulkner, I would want him to give me a call and discuss a license fee.""","William Faulkner quotation subject of a lawsuit .

"By . Mark Nicol . PUBLISHED: . 17:05 EST, 23 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:58 EST, 23 November 2013 . The Royal Household last night defended hiring out the ballroom at Buckingham Palace to investment bank  JP Morgan for a lavish dinner hosted by the Duke of York. The bank paid an undisclosed fee to hire the ballroom and made donations to the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Royal Ballet, which provided entertainment. Among the 100 guests were banking executives, Tony Blair, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and Indian industrialist Ratan Tata. Prince Andrew, Duke of York, is at the centre of a new 'Palace for hire' row . A Palace spokeswoman said the event was part of Prince Andrew’s ongoing work to ‘support British prosperity’. But Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘I understand the Palace needs to cut costs and raise money, but dining there should be a privilege rather than being open to the highest bidder. ‘The security implications are also an issue.’ The Household’s relationship with senior corporate figures was previously questioned after St James’s Palace was rented out, apparently at a cost of £30,000 a day, during the London Olympics. Buckingham Palace said that the State Apartments were occasionally used by outside organisations to generate income to pay for the upkeep of its properties – a recommendation made in a recent parliamentary report. The Royal Ballet performed at the Buckingham Pallace event . The event in the ballroom on October 30 was reportedly arranged by a personal friend of Prince Andrew called  David Mayhew, who is one of JP Morgan’s most senior staff. JP Morgan declined to comment last night but a Palace spokesman said: ‘Events at Buckingham Palace, of which there have been around 200 in the past year, are hosted by members of the Royal Family in conjunction with a variety  of organisations. ‘Re-charging the costs of the event where appropriate is standard practice.’","JP Morgan payed an undisclosed sum to hold lavish event .

"Three claimants had challenged the new measures which set earnings thresholds for people wishing to sponsor the UK visas of spouses coming from abroad.
A judge said the court would not ""strike down"" the rules, but urged the home secretary to adjust them.
The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said the ruling proved they were ""disproportionate"".
The Home Office introduced the rules in July 2012 to ease the financial burden of migration on the state.
Under the new family migration policy only British citizens, or those with refugee status, who earn at least £18,600 a year can sponsor their non-European spouse's visa.
This rises to £22,400 for families with a child, and a further £2,400 for each extra child.
The policy had been challenged on the basis that the rules were discriminatory and interfered with Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, the right to a private and family life.
The court concluded that the measures were not unlawful on the basis of discrimination, or due to a conflict with the statutory duty to regard the best interests of children while making visa decisions.
Mr Justice Blake, sitting in London, said it would not be appropriate to ""strike down"" the financial requirements set out in the rules - which were laid before Parliament in June 2012.
However, he said that the earnings threshold was disproportionate if combined with one of the four other requirements in the rules - for example, an inability to supplement a shortfall in income with savings, unless the savings were over £16,000.
He said that while there may be sound reasons in favour of some of the individual requirements ""taken in isolation"", the combination of more than one of the five requirements of the rules was ""so onerous in effect as to be an unjustified and disproportionate interference with a genuine spousal relationship"".
The judge also suggested that a more ""proportionate financial requirement"" might be to reduce the minimum income required of the sponsor alone to about £13,000.
In a written ruling, the judge said it would be ""for the secretary of state, if she sees fit, to make such adjustments to the rules as will meet the observations of this judgement"".
The BBC's legal affairs correspondent Clive Coleman says it is now for Mrs May to decide whether any amendments should be made to the rules to satisfy the requirements of proportionality.
The home secretary has been given permission to appeal.
Responding to the ruling, a Home Office spokesperson said: ""Our family changes were brought in to make sure that spouses coming to live in the UK would not become reliant on the taxpayer for financial support and would be able to integrate effectively. We're pleased that this judgment supports the basis of our approach.
""We are looking closely at the judgment and its likely impact on the minimum income threshold before we decide how to respond.
""In the meantime, where an applicant does not meet the minimum income threshold and there is no other reason to refuse it, the application will be put on hold.""
JCWI's legal and policy director, Saira Grant, said that while she was disappointed the financial requirement rule had not been overturned, her organisation was ""very pleased that the judiciary has given a clear message that £18,600 is a disproportionately high requirement"".
She said the judge's comments represented a ""clear message to (Home Secretary) Theresa May and she needs to sit up and listen"".
Ms Grant added that the judge's suggestion of a financial requirement of about £13,000 was a ""reasonable, workable figure"", but that people would still lose out.
Meanwhile, a group of MPs and Lords known as the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration has called for an independent review of the minimum income requirement.
In a review published last month, it looked at more than 175 cases from families affected by the rules.
Baroness Hamwee, chairwoman of the review and Liberal Democrat home affairs lead in the House of Lords, said the parliamentary group had been ""struck by the evidence showing just how many British people have been kept apart from partners, children and elderly relatives"".
""These rules are causing anguish for families and, counter to their original objectives, may actually be costing the public purse,"" she said.
The group said thousands of Britons had been unable to bring non-EU spouses to the UK since the minimum earnings requirements were introduced.","UK family immigration rules are not unlawful but are ""onerous... and unjustified"", the High Court has ruled."
"An Arizona mother is being investigated for allegedly contributing to the death of her newborn baby, who tested positive for methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana.

"(CNN) -- Africa is poor, corrupt and rural. Right? Think again. A team of young documentary makers is hoping to burst the myth of Africa as a dangerous backwater by shining a light on some inspiring projects taking place on the continent. When filmmaker Nosarieme Garrick hit the streets of New York to ask passersby: ""What do you know about Africa?"" the overwhelming response was ""not a lot."" ""It's very big, very hot. Most of Africa's impoverished. I'm pretty ignorant to Africa,"" admitted one man. ""I know about some human rights violations, some wars and genocides,"" was the bleak answer from another woman. It was a dismal reflection of many Western stereotypes surrounding Africa -- one that Nosarieme is determined to change. Watch: Fighting Hollywood stereotypes . My Africa is: hopeful . The 27-year-old hopes to launch an eight-part documentary series 'My Africa Is' -- showcasing the continent through the eyes of its insiders. ""The four things that come to mind when people think of Africa are population, problems, poverty, and promise unfulfilled -- headline media reports on the continent. But that's not the whole story,"" Nosarieme, originally from Nigeria and now living in Washington, said. The ambitious project would cover 13 cities across sub-Saharan Africa. Organizers are trying to crowdsource funds through the Kickstarter website and hope to start filming in October if they reach their target. ""Between the 1980s and now the image of famine and wars has been ingrained in people's minds. That's a narrative that's going to be hard to shift,"" Nosarieme said. ""That's not to discount the fact that this stuff does happen. But what I wasn't seeing was the solutions."" See also: South African ballet dancer confounds stereotypes . Nigeria the troubled oil giant . First up in the documentary series is Abuja in Nigeria -- a country that until the election of President Goodluck Jonathan last year had largely lurched from one military coup to the next. This is Africa's most populous country and its leading oil producer. Yet few in the country have benefited from the oil boom with more than half the population still living in poverty. See also: Congo's designer dandies . The President was recently forced to sack bosses from state-owned oil company NNPC amid corruption allegations . Then there's the ongoing violence between Muslim and Christian groups in the north, with even Pope Benedict XVI weighing in to call for an end to the brutality. Put simply, when it comes to Nigeria, the headlines aren't great. Getting on the Photowagon . But according to Nosereime, that's only half the story. ""Nigeria is going through a turbulent time,"" she admitted. ""But there's a rising youth who are trying to educate each other."" Indeed the trailer for the first My Africa Is show, the focus is on Photowagon -- a Nigerian photography collective ""on a mission to show the giant of Africa through the lens."" Launched in 2009, their powerful images paint a very different image of Africa. It's a well-rounded collection that captures the frivolity of everyday life, such as market scenes and football matches. But doesn't shy away from some of the more familiar and gruesome notions of Nigeria such as terrorist attacks and military clampdowns. The 'other' Nigeria . Photowagon co-founder Aisha Augie-Kuta says her mission is to ""conquer sports photography as a northern Nigerian female"" -- a bold statement for a ""very conservative"" country. But the gung-ho 33-year-old appears undeterred as she takes 'My Africa Is' to a Nigeria vs Argentina football match in the capital Abuja. Traditional dancers and hip-hop singers entertain the crowds during half-time, while ecstatic fans hug each other with each goal. It's an image of Nigeria that couldn't be further from the grim headlines. Aisha admitted that if you believed the Western media, you wouldn't step foot inside Africa. ""They see us as a continent without hope,"" the mother-of-three said. ""For Africans, we see hope on the street everyday. But on the news you don't see that. It's always about the negative stuff. ""Instead, what we see is a lot of poor children dying from malaria or polio. If you listened to the news everyday you'd have no hope from the bombings or corruption. Don't get me wrong, it is happening. But it's not a constant. It's not the Nigeria we in Lagos or Abuja are living in."" See also: South Africa's underground youth culture . The 33-year-old said the country had come a long way since she was growing up under a military regime in the northern state of Kebbi. Aisha remained optimistic about democratic change in the west African country, particularly for women, but was also realistic about its pace. ""There's a lot of opportunity and hope as to where we can be,"" she said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:19 AM on 5th September 2011 . Dominique Strauss-Kahn and his wife Anne Sinclair smile as they finally return home to France yesterday, despite warnings that the disgraced former IMF chief’s problems are far from over. They arrived at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris amid a storm of protest, led by the French First Lady. Referring to the May sexual assault charges against him in New York being dropped, Carla Bruni told TF1 news: ‘I don’t understand how this whole business came to an end. Happy to be back: The former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn and wife Anne Sinclair arrive back on French soil . Former International Monetary Fund leader Dominique Strauss-Kahn and his wife Anne Sinclair leave the Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle airport in Paris this morning after a U.S. rape case against him collapsed . Welcome home: Strauss-Kahn and his wife beamed as they travelled down the escalator upon their first return to their native France since he was arrested in New York in May . ‘I am a bit confused, and I simply . detested all the machismo reactions that followed. When women are . belittled and attacked, I tend to take their side and feel solidarity . with them.’ Strauss-Kahn’s accuser, Guinean hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo, will now pursue a civil case. The 62-year-old also faces another investigation in France over attempted rape, based on accusations by novelist Tristane Banon. When they landed in France, a police escort was waiting to rush the couple through customs and into a waiting Peugot limousine. French . detectives also indicated that they also intended to speak to Mr . Strauss-Kahn about  sex-related accusations being levelled at him in . Paris. The couple on Saturday night left their the $50,000-a-month Manhattan town home Strauss-Kahn had rented for his house arrest and boarded the flight at John F.Kennedy International airport. Big interest: Strauss-Kahn, his wife and press officer Anne Hommel being guided through the media pack as they arrive at their home in Place des Vosges, Paris . The  62-year-old lost his job as IMF . chief after Diallo, a chamber maid at the Manhattan Sofitel, . said she was attacked. Strauss-Kahn . admitted having a sexual encounter with her, but his lawyers . controversially argued that it has been a consensual one. Strauss-Kahn, spent almost a week . in jail after being removed by police from a plane about to take off . for Paris, six weeks under house arrest and nearly two more months . barred from leaving the country before Manhattan prosecutors dropped the . case last week, saying they no longer trusted the maid. Strauss-Kahn talks to his wife in the courtyard of their home. The 62-year-old lost his job as IMF . chief after Nafissatou Diallo, a chamber maid at the Manhattan Sofitel, . said she was attacked. The couple are dwarfed by the massive entrance into their home. Strauss-Kahn admitted having a sexual encounter with the woman, but his lawyers controversially argued that it has been a consensual one . Diallo is continuing to press her claims in a civil lawsuit. Strauss-Kahn denies the allegations. Strauss-Kahn has been free to travel . internationally since his passport was returned late last week . He'd . told reporters he was eager to return to France, but he first took a . trip to Washington, DC, on Monday to bid farewell to former IMF . colleagues at the lending agency's headquarters. Until his arrest, Strauss-Kahn was . considered the Socialist Party's front-runner to take on conservative . French President Nicolas Sarkozy next year. Socialists have rejoiced in . the dismissal of the criminal case against Strauss-Kahn, but few . observers in France expect a political return from him anytime soon. 'This . is a man who has suffered. It is a man who will obviously take some . time to get his bearings,' his biographer, Michel Taubmann said. The maid is continuing to press her claims in a civil lawsuit but it's unclear if Strauss-Kahn will return to New York as defendants aren't required to go court dates . Face the music: Strauss-Kahn was met by a police escort at the airport and left in a waiting Peugot limousine which was chased by a media pack on motorcycles . Strauss-Kahn also will have to . contend with a sexual assault allegation that surfaced in France after . his New York arrest. Authorities are investigating novelist Tristane . Banon's complaint that Strauss-Kahn tried to rape her while she was . interviewing him in 2002 — an incident her mother, a regional Socialist . official, has said she discouraged her from reporting at the time but is . now encouraging her to pursue. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers have called Banon's account 'imaginary'. And Strauss-Kahn still faces Diallo's . lawsuit in New York, though it's unclear when he might have to be in . New York for the civil case. Lawsuits can take years to play out, and . defendants aren't required to come to court dates, as they generally are . in criminal cases. She's seeking unspecified damages. Jetset: Strauss-Kahn and Anne arriving at John F. Kennedy airport in New York, bound for Paris . Leaving: Strauss-Kahn left the U.S. 112 days after he first tried to leave but was arrested on an Air France jet at Kennedy airport . Diallo, . 33, says Strauss-Kahn chased her down in his suite and attacked her . after she arrived to clean it. Prosecutors said DNA evidence shows they . had a sexual encounter; his lawyers say it was consensual. After initially portraying Diallo as a . compelling witness, prosecutors developed doubts about her credibility. She had told them a concocted tale of having been gang-raped in the . past, among other falsehoods about her background, and they said she . gave varying versions of her actions immediately after her encounter . with Strauss-Kahn. 'We simply no longer have confidence . beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty,' prosecutors . wrote in a court filing last week. Strauss-Kahn will also have to . contend with a sexual assault allegation that surfaced in France after . his New York arrest . Delighted: Long-suffering Anne arrives at security at JFK . Diallo . has said she's telling the truth about being attacked. One of her . lawyers, Douglas Wigdor, has said prosecutors' decision to abandon the . criminal case 'is an affront to Ms. Diallo and to all victims who come . forward in the future.' It has also emerged that Ms Diallo . could also testify against Strauss-Kahn in Paris. Her lawyer has filed a . complaint accusing Mr Strauss-Kahn’s staff of interfering with a . potential prosecution witness. The so far unnamed witness is a past . lover of Strauss-Kahn who says he abused her while he was the mayor of . the Paris suburb of Sarcelles. Au revoir: Strauss-Kahn and Anne leave their Manhattan town house for JFK with about half-a-dozen pieces of luggage . Au revoir! Strauss-Kahn leaves his rented town home on Franklin Street in the Tribeca section of downtown Manhattan . Strauss-Kahn was already married to . Ms Sinclair, his third wife, when he met the witness at a party . organised by the French Socialist Party in 1997 . They became lovers within hours, even though she was just 23 and he was 47, and went on to meet regularly for almost a year. But when their secret affair ended badly she is said to have tried to commit suicide because of Strauss-Kahn’s abuse. Leaving: Strauss-Kahn is confronted by a media pack outside the townhouse . Happy to go? Strauss-Kahn leaves new York more than three months after he was taken off an Air France jet at JFK . Paris-based barrister Thibault de Montbrial said he had filed the complaint in Pontoise, another Paris suburb, saying Strauss-Kahn’s legal team had ‘put pressure’ on the witness, including offering her money to remain silent. This would amount to perjury, and could result in a prison sentence for those involved in the alleged cover-up of evidence, with Ms Diallo appearing in Paris as a prosecution witness. It would also allow Ms Diallo’s legal team to rehearse their case against Strauss-Kahn in France, so opening him up to further prosecution.

Lewis Holtby could be one of the first out of the door with Hamburg set to secure the playmaker on a season-long loan deal and a permanent £6m deal could follow.

Aaron Lennon and Sandro could also be on the way with fellow Londoners QPR - and former Spurs boss Harry Redknapp - interested in the duo. Redknapp is also set to sign young Tottenham left-back Zeki Fryers but he will have to fight off interest from Crystal Palace too.

"The jet engine maker reported a loss before tax of £4.6bn for 2016.
However, once one-off costs have been stripped out, the company's underlying profit was better than many experts had predicted.
Rolls-Royce agreed to pay £671m to settle corruption cases with UK and US authorities and it has written off £4.4bn from currency related contracts.
Like many international businesses, Rolls-Royce usually ""hedges"" its bets to protect itself from fluctuating currency markets.
Most international aerospace contracts are priced in dollars, but, as a UK company, much of Rolls-Royce's costs are in pounds.
Simon Jack: Rolls Royce – The good, the bad and the ugly
It takes out long-term currency trades. These were designed to protect the firm against what seemed the most likely risk- the fall in the dollar - and many of them were put in place before the EU referendum was even announced.
Since the Brexit vote, the pound has fallen sharply against the US dollar, which has led to the accounting loss.
Underlying profits, which ignore these factors, fell to £813m, down from £1.4bn the previous year, although the fall was much less than many analysts had forecast.
Rolls-Royce, which has been a completely separate company to the car-maker since 1971, said the outlook for this year was for a ""modest performance improvement"", while chief executive Warren East said more needed to be done to improve profit margins.
Mr East took over as chief executive in 2015 with the task of turning round the struggling company. It is in the process of carrying out a major cost-cutting drive.
""We must ensure our wide ranging business transformation programme delivers the full benefits expected, not only in terms of cost savings but also the cultural and behavioural changes necessary to ensure the transformation is sustained and high standards of business conduct are maintained,"" said Mr East.
""These are essential if we are to become a more trusted, resilient company.""
Rolls-Royce has apologised ""unreservedly"" for the corruption cases, which spanned 25 years, and involved illegally using local middlemen and paying bribes to win deals in Indonesia, Thailand, China and Russia.
In the whacky world of the City, bad headlines can sometimes be ignored.
That has been the case with Rolls-Royce; when it said last month it would pay £671m to settle a long-running bribery investigation its shares went up 6%.
Investors were relieved the worst was behind it, and the same may apply to today's whacking loss. While it underlines the complicated nature of Rolls-Royce's business - it has a £30bn currency hedging book, designed, ironically, to flatten out volatility, and has unkindly been described as a hedge fund with an engine maker attached -  shareholders will focus on underlying trading.
There, the news is a bit better than expected, with cashflow and profit both slightly ahead of market expectations.
After an annus horribilis (or two) Rolls-Royce still has some big strategic questions. It is still expanding production at a breakneck pace, which drains its reserves, and must still decide whether to take the drastic medicine advocated by some and shed some of its operations, such as the marine engine operation.
Warren East, the chief executive, gave a hint that he is coming to some conclusions on the future of the company - he said he expected to set out a ""vision"" in the next few months.",A bribery settlement and the fall in the pound have pushed engineering giant Rolls-Royce to a record loss.
"The firm's final results for the year ended 31 March 2015 also show a rise in pre-tax profit by 11% to £10.8m.
Without one-off costs, adjusted profit rose to £16.6m.
Iomart listed its ""highlights"" as ""strengthened relationships"" ""with major vendors such as Microsoft and EMC"" and better ""opportunities from the market for Hybrid Cloud solutions"".
A hybrid cloud is where some resources and provided and managed in-house where others are sourced externally.
Iomart said it had benefited from the increasing complexity of a hybrid cloud.
These include questions about cost, value, effectiveness, security and compliance, around the core business of providing data storage capacity in several centres.
Chief executive Angus MacSween said customers were seeking to combine their own IT hardware with contracts for use of private space in a separate data centre, along with use of the publicly-available cloud.
""The effective management of all these is the opportunity for Iomart which we would collectively term the hybrid cloud,"" he said.
The company has been buying other firms over the past year, helping to drive up those revenue figures figures. Including acquisitions, the hosting of cloud data rose in value by 23% to £55m, though without them, growth was 9%.
Revenue fell slightly in Easyspace, the division which supports clients' websites and email.
On Monday, it was announced that Iomart had bought the London-based cloud computing consultancy, SystemsUp, for at least £9m.","Glasgow-based cloud computing company Iomart has reported a rise in revenue of 18%, to £66m."
"The visitors led when John Stones' sloppy pass allowed Nathan Redmond to round Claudio Bravo and slot in.
City improved after being booed off by some home fans at the break, equalising when half-time substitute Kelechi Iheanacho prodded in Leroy Sane's low cross.
Pep Guardiola's side controlled the second half as they searched for a winner, but Saints keeper Fraser Forster produced splendid saves to deny Ilkay Gundogan and David Silva.
City's inability to grab a second goal means ex-Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss Guardiola has failed to win in five successive matches for only the second time in his managerial career.
However, the point was still enough to lift the Blues back above Arsenal and Liverpool to the Premier League summit.
Southampton stay eighth after extending their unbeaten league run to a fifth game.
City's recent struggles are barely believable after the swaggering start they made to the season, when they won all of Guardiola's opening 10 matches.
The former Spain international had been forced to defend his tactics following Wednesday's 4-0 Champions League defeat at his former club Barcelona, which came after their first loss of the season at Tottenham and the subsequent home draw against Everton.
But there were signs of the home support becoming frustrated with his team's build-from-the-back approach, not least when many could be heard jeering their team off at the break after Stones' error.
City lacked aggression and tempo in the opening 45 minutes, allowing an organised Southampton side to contain them and then burst forward on the break.
Guardiola had to act - and he did that decisively at the break.
Off came Kevin de Bruyne - City's stand-out performer this season - with young striker Iheanacho introduced in his place.
As a result, City had much more purpose and drive, typified by the desire showed by Iheanacho to beat Saints defender Virgil van Dijk to Sane's cross and prod in the equaliser.
Stones is the only player to feature in every match of Guardiola's reign following his £47.5m summer move from Everton, impressing his new manager with his composure and ability to play out comfortably from the back.
But critics have argued the England international is guilty of over-playing, leaving himself open to making mistakes. They were proved right on both counts when he gifted Southampton the lead.
After receiving the ball just outside his own area, Stones tried to pass inside to returning skipper Vincent Kompany - instead playing it behind his captain and straight to Redmond.
The 22-year-old thought he had redeemed himself five minutes later, guiding in De Bruyne's curling free-kick with a far-post volley - but it was ruled out for offside and instead his impact on this game will be remembered for the wrong reasons.
Stones has now made four errors leading to goals since the start of last season - more than any other outfield Premier League player.
Southampton arrived at a sunny Etihad Stadium with the intention of ending a miserable record of six successive defeats at the ground.
Arguably this was their greatest opportunity in recent seasons, having showed they were starting to click under new manager Claude Puel while City had been toiling.
The Frenchman saw his side earn just two points in his first four games after replacing Ronald Koeman, but any doubts about his appointment appear to have been curtailed by a rich vein of form.
Saints were compact and organised defensively, while not afraid to use the pace of Redmond and Dusan Tadic on the break.
True, their goal was gifted to them and they also managed just one other shot on target - but despite not creating many chances, they did threaten to stretch City on a number of occasions and deserved a point for their work-rate and commitment alone.
City manager Pep Guardiola: ""The second half was much better. The first half wasn't really good. Of course our mistake was bad. The way I want to play is not to pass to the striker.
On the second-half recovery: ""They did it for themselves in the second half. They changed the game, I didn't change the game. We did think we were going to win it, but Southampton didn't make it easy. They have good defenders and are good at everything.
On the displays in the winless last five games: ""We have to analyse what is the situation. In the period, apart from at White Hart Lane against Tottenham [losing 2-0] it's been good. Against Everton and Barcelona - when it was 11 v 11 -  the displays were as good as those in the first 10 games.""
Media playback is not supported on this device
Southampton boss Claude Puel:
""We can be satisfied with this point, we played against a good team and it was important to keep a good structure. We took our chances to score and after we defended well.
""My players played just two days ago in the Europa League, they were tired, but showed good spirit and organisation.
""Against fantastic players it was good to take a point and not disappointing. It was hard to defend at the end of the game but I am very satisfied.""

Waiting lists for designer handbags, clothes or even the latest must-have children's toy have become the norm. And now beauty companies have joined their ranks by garnering huge waiting lists before their products have even hit the shops. Lancome's DreamTone serum promising 'ground-breaking results' is the latest product to be in such high demand that it has accumulated a waiting list of 1,400 people before it is even released next week. In high demand: Lancome's Dreamtone serum has a waiting list of more than 1,400 people before it is even released next week . The cream is said to 'revolutionise' skin tone by reducing dark age spots by 66 per cent in just four weeks. The £69 serum isn't officially released until August 15, but stars Sarah Jessica Parker and Naomi Campbell are believed to already have a bottle of the coveted beauty product, The Times reports. The product is the result of seven years of research into the causes of hyperpigmentation. The Forever Light Creator anti-aging serum by Yves Saint Laurent accumulated a huge online waiting list of 3,000 ahead of its release last month . It is not the first time that a beauty product has become a success before its even been released. The £125 anti-ageing cream Cult 51, which is said to contain the most expensive ingredients ever, had more than 5,000 people on the waiting list when it was released last month. Model Kelly Brook and singer Myleene Klass are believed to be fans of the night cream made by British chemist Richard Mears after being given pre-release samples. In trials so far, Cult 51 has been found to reverse the signs of ageing by up to five years in just six weeks. It is clinically proven to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines by up to 52 per cent in 28 days. It increases the skin’s absorption of oxygen by up to 45 per cent and in trials reduced the appearance of age spots by up a quarter in 12 weeks. Mr Mears said it is the first skincare product on the market that can claim to have ‘3D effects’ as it stimulates the skin to produce its own collagen while increasing cell production and oxygen flow in the skin. He said: 'Most anti-ageing creams do only one or two things, so consumers end up buying several products, such as those aimed at day time use, nights, the eyes and skin brightening, to get the full benefits. 'Brands want to sell many products to their customers and maximise sales. However, there is an accepted wisdom within skin care that the skin can only absorb so much active and that too many products actually smother it, preventing it from functioning naturally.' Yves Saint Laurent's Forever Light Creator range also totted up a huge online waiting list of 3,000 ahead of its release last month. A record-breaking 15,000 free sample vouchers for the £61 serum were also downloaded before it even hit the shops. The company even set up a dedicated hotline for customers wanting to order the product as makers YSL attempted to keep up with demand. Shoppers wanting to buy Max Factor's Lashfinity 72-hour mascara were subject to a three-week waiting list earlier this year.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 06:00 EST, 17 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:46 EST, 17 January 2013 . MPs who demanded pay rises of up to 32 per cent were today branded ‘potty’ by Nick Clegg. The Deputy Prime Minister said it ‘beggars belief’ that MPs surveyed by the Commons expenses watchdog had said they should be earning tens of thousands of pounds more. A survey last week revealed that 69 per cent believe they are ‘underpaid’ following the introduction of a new expenses regime that forces them to provide receipts for all claims. Nick Clegg said MPs were wrong to demand vast pay rises when public sector workers were seeing salaries increase by just one per cent . The studies were commissioned by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which is reviewing whether MPs’ pay should be changed from its current level of £65,738. On average, Tories said their salary should be £96,740, while Lib Dems thought the right amount was £78,361 and Labour £77,322. Mr Clegg said: ‘It just beggars belief apparently that some MPs have anonymously said they deserve a pay increase.’ Challenged over MPs pay on his weekly radio phone-in, he added: ‘They are living on a different planet to think that you can say to teachers and nurses and doctors “you’re only going to get a one per cent increase in your pay for the next several years but we deserve a [32 per cent] increase”. ‘I think it’s potty and it’s not going to happen, certainly if I’ve got anything to do with it.’ YouGov conducted online interviews with 100 MPs on Ipsa's behalf, and weighted the results slightly to represent the Commons by party, gender, year elected, and geography. Conservatives were the most likely to believe they were underpaid, with 47 per cent saying that was the case. Some 39 per cent of Labour members and 9 per cent of Lib Dems held the same view. One MP said they should be paid £40,000 or less. Some 5 per cent said £60-65,000 was fair, and 17% went for £65-£70,000.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- The Bigfoot in the freezer is made of rubber, a Web posting asserted Tuesday. The frozen creature reputed to be Bigfoot turned out to be made of rubber, an enthusaist reports. The initial promoter of two hikers' claim that they found the body of Bigfoot in Georgia said he has determined that the discovery was a hoax. The body turned out to be rubber, and the two men who claimed that they found it, Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer, have admitted that it was a costume, said a posting Tuesday on the Web sites of Searching for Bigfoot Inc. and Squatchdetective. The posting purportedly was written by Steve Kulls, who maintains the Squatchdetective Web site and hosts a similarly named Internet radio program, where the find was announced weeks ago. In addition, Stanford University anthropologist Richard Klein said Monday that he was not aware he had been identified as participating in the project and would not be involved in any effort to examine the purported Bigfoot carcass. Whitton and Dyer announced last week that they had found the body of a 7-foot-7-inch, 500-pound half-ape, half-human creature while hiking in the north Georgia mountains in June. They said they put the carcass in a freezer and had spotted about three similar living creatures. ""We were not looking for Bigfoot,"" Whitton, a Clayton County, Georgia, police officer, said Friday during a news conference. ""We wouldn't know what we were doing if we did."" He and Dyer insisted that scientific analysis would bear out their claim. The hoax was discovered after an ""expedited melting process,"" Kulls wrote. ""A break appeared up near the feet area ... as the team and I began examining this area near the feet, I observed the foot which looked unnatural, reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot."" Kulls said he contacted Tom Biscardi, the self-described ""Real Bigfoot Hunter"" who has been searching since 1971 for the creature of legend and appeared alongside Whitton and Dyer at the news conference. ""Later that day, Tom Biscardi informed us that both Matthew Whitton and Ricky Dyer admitted it was a costume,"" the posting said. Whitton and Dyer reportedly agreed to sign a promissory note and an admission of the hoax and meet with Biscardi at their hotel on Sunday. But when Biscardi went to the hotel, the two had left, Kulls wrote. ""At this time, action is being instigated against the perpetrators,"" the posting said, adding that the motives behind the claims were unknown. iReport.com: Do you believe in Bigfoot? The posting said Biscardi's organization, Searching for Bigfoot Inc., ""is seeking justice for themselves and for all the people who were deceived by this deception."" Kulls did not immediately return a call to the Squatchdetective contact number. A woman answering the phone at Searching for Bigfoot Inc. said Biscardi had been ill and said she was not sure when he would be returning calls. A number listed as belonging to Matthew Whitton was disconnected as of Tuesday. Efforts to locate a phone number for Dyer on Tuesday were unsuccessful. Dyer and Whitton failed to show up Monday for a scheduled appearance on CNN's ""American Morning."" Kulls said that at the time he first interviewed Dyer on July 28 for the radio program, he suspected the duo's motive was financial. On August 12, he said, the two ""requested an undisclosed sum of money as an advance, expected from the marketing and promotion."" Two days later, after signing a receipt and counting the money, Dyer and Whitton showed the Searching for Bigfoot team the freezer containing what they claimed was the body: ""something appearing large, hairy and frozen in ice,"" Kulls wrote. Dyer, he said, insisted on holding the news conference and told Biscardi he would not release the body unless the briefing was held Friday. On Sunday, the research team was able to extract some hair and burn it. The hair sample ""melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair,"" Kulls wrote. Biscardi then gave the group permission to expedite the melting process, and the rubber foot was discovered, Kulls wrote. Meanwhile, Klein, the Stanford professor, said Monday that he was ""sorry that my name and Stanford's name have been brought into this."" Klein's name was mentioned Friday as one of four scientists, two of them Russian, who would analyze the corpse. Klein said he was unaware that Biscardi had identified him. He said he had been contacted by Biscardi in the past and responded to a request to examine bones that were identified as coming from a deer. ""He seems like a nice enough guy,"" Klein said, ""but I can't imagine why anyone would devote their lives to proving the existence [of Bigfoot]. Anything has a remote chance of being true, but there is virtually no prospect of this animal being real.""

"(CNN) -- Three former Penn State University officials -- including ex-President Graham Spanier -- have been charged with conspiring to cover up years of sexual abuse against children by former football coach Jerry Sandusky. Spanier, along with former Athletic Director Tim Curley and ex-Vice President Gary Schultz, each face the same eight counts related to the Sandusky scandal, including perjury, conspiracy and endangering the welfare of children, Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly announced Thursday. Curley and Schultz are scheduled for a preliminary arraignment at Magisterial District Judge William C. Wenner's office at 2 p.m. on Friday, and Spanier's preliminary arraignment is slated for next Wednesday at 9:30 a.m. at the same judge's office, according to a Pennsylvania courts spokesman Jim Koval. Each of the three men is expected to attend his arraignment, said Koval. This is the first time Spanier has been charged in the wake of the scandal, which started unfolding publicly a year ago. Curley and Schultz previously had been charged with perjury and failing to report suspected child abuse. The three men ""essentially turned a blind eye to serial predatory acts"" by Sandusky, Kelly told a news conference in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Jerry Sandusky proclaims his innocence in jailhouse audio recording . ""This was not a mistake by these men. It was not an oversight. It was not misjudgment on their part. This was a conspiracy of silence by top officials working to actively conceal the truth, with total disregard for the children who were Sandusky's victims in this case,"" she said. Spanier's attorneys said ""there is no factual basis to support these charges"" and accused Kelly of acting as a pawn for Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett, who they said ""has made no secret of his personal hostility toward Dr. Spanier."" ""These charges are the work of a vindictive and politically motivated governor working through an unelected attorney general, Linda Kelly, whom he appointed to do his bidding and who will be a lame duck five days from now,"" according to a statement from the attorneys. They also accused Kelly and her staff of ""steadfastly"" refusing to meet with Spanier or his legal representatives ""despite repeated attempts to do so."" Gov. Corbett's spokesman Kevin Harley responded, ""Graham Spanier's statement is the ranting of a man who has just been indicted for covering up for a convicted pedophile. His arrogance reveals a man who has just found out that he is not above the law after all."" As a result of the charges, Penn State said Spanier -- who was removed as president in November 2011 -- will be placed on immediate leave. He had continued to serve as a tenured professor, although he was on a sabbatical. Attorneys blast Freeh report as Spanier speaks out . Penn State said it recently informed Curley that his fixed-term contract will not be renewed when it expires in June. Schultz had retired after he was initially charged last year. The university refused to comment on the charges ""out of respect for the legal process."" Curley's attorney Caroline Roberto said prosecutors didn't give her team any advance notice of the new charges. ""To be clear, Tim Curley is innocent of all charges,"" Roberto said in a statement. ""We are carefully reviewing the presentment and will reserve a more comprehensive comment for a later time."" Roberto filed a pre-trial motion Wednesday, asking to dismiss or suppress Curley's grand jury testimony. The motion alleges a conflict of interest because the woman Curley believed was representing him at the time, was actually representing Penn State University. CNN has reached out to Schultz's attorney Thomas Farrell, who previously said Schultz is innocent of the initial charges and he would fight to clear Schultz's name. Sandusky, 68, was convicted in June on 45 counts of child sex abuse, ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, which were laid out in graphic testimony by his accusers over the course of the less-than-two-week trial. Last month, he was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison, meaning he'll likely die behind bars. Speaking Thursday, Kelly cited as evidence a series of e-mails among Spanier, Schultz, and Curley from February 2001, referring, somewhat in code, to the infamous incident in which assistant coach Mike McQueary walked in on Sandusky sexually assaulting a young boy in a university shower room. CNN first reported in June about the allegedly incriminating e-mails. Ousted Penn State president says he was abused as a child . In July, in a 267-page report commissioned by the university, former FBI Director Louis Freeh blamed the three men and legendary former head football coach Joe Paterno for having ""never demonstrated ... any concern for the safety and well-being of Sandusky's victims until after Sandusky's arrest,"" while the board of trustees failed to perform its oversight duties. Paterno died on January 22. ""I'm not going to speculate or comment on Mr. Paterno's relationship to this investigation,"" Kelly said Thursday. ""He's deceased, and that's the end of it."" In an August interview published in the New Yorker magazine, Spanier ripped the Freeh report. ""It's unfair, it's deeply flawed, it has many errors and omissions,"" the former university president told Jeffrey Toobin, a staff writer for The New Yorker and CNN senior legal analyst. ""They interviewed, they say, over 430 people; many of those folks have spoken to me about their interviews. Many of them describe those interviews to me as a witch hunt."" Curley and Schultz are scheduled for a January trial on the initial two charges. Kelly said she thinks now that Spanier has been charged, the three men should face a joint trial, because of the intertwined nature of the charges. In July, the National Collegiate Athletic Association vacated Penn State's football wins dating back to 1998, the year when allegations that Sandusky was abusing children were first made. That penalty removed Paterno from the top of the list of Division I college football's winningest coaches. Sandusky, Paterno's top defensive assistant for more than two decades, has been placed in protective custody at the State Correctional Institution at Greene in Waynesburg, where he'll serve out his sentence for sexually abusing boys. Penn State review recasts story of football hero Paterno . ""Given the high-profile nature of this individual, coupled with the nature of his crimes, this makes him very vulnerable in a prison setting,"" Corrections Secretary John Wetzel said. He was transferred to the state prison Wednesday from the State Correctional Institution at Camp Hill, where he was physically and mentally evaluated. In the 1,800-inmate prison in Waynesburg, the former coach is being held in a single cell and has additional supervision and an escort when he's out of his cell for the three showers and five hours of exercise he is allotted weekly. All meals and any counseling or medical visits will take place in Sandusky's cell, according to a statement from the state's Department of Corrections. All visits will be ""noncontact,"" the statement said. Sandusky will be allowed to have a television, radio and other personal property as authorized by prison officials. Jurors determined that Sandusky, who retired from Penn State in 1999, used his access to university facilities and his foundation for underprivileged youths to abuse the boys sexually. During the trial, a 23-year-old man identified as Victim No. 4 testified that he was 13 when Sandusky sexually abused him in a university shower. Sandusky is appealing his conviction.

"ISIS is using British female extremists to incite other UK women to carry out terror attacks, according to researchers, as fears are raised that pupils are still at risk of being radicalised in schools. Experts at King's College London say they have identified a group of around 30 British women in northern Syria, who are encouraging others to launch terrorist attacks in the UK. The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) has studied the social media accounts of female jihadis, and has found that instead of supporting their male counterparts, many are actively helping to recruit female would-be extremists, often encouraging them to carry out atrocities in the UK. ISIS is using British female extremists to incite UK terror attacks, according to researchers, as fears are raised that pupils are still at risk of being radicalised in schools, and authorities continue to hunt Hayat Boumeddiene (left), the wife of kosher supermarket killer Amedy Coulibaly (right) Details of the study comes as Britain and the rest of Europe remain on high alert following the shootings in Paris earlier this month. Authorities are still hunting Hayat Boumeddiene, the wife of kosher supermarket killer Amedy Coulibaly, who is thought to have fled to Syria to join up with Islamic State fighters. She is suspected of helping plan the Paris attacks, but had left France before the Kouachi brothers – Cherif, 32, and Said, 34, opened fire on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, arriving in Istanbul on January 2. Boumeddienee, who is suspected of helping plan the Paris attacks, is pictured (right) at passport control following her arrival in Istanbul on January 2 . Around 50 British women and girls are thought to have joined ISIS, with the majority based in the jihadist's stronghold Raqqa and aged between 16 and 24. Among them are 16-year-old twins Salma and Zahra Halane who fled their home in Chorlton, Manchester, to follow their brother to Syria - where it is believed they have married IS fighters. Former public schoolgirl Aqsa Mahmood, 20, from Glasgow, is known to have been in Raqqa helping to organise religious patrols. Former public schoolgirl Aqsa Mahmood, 20, from Glasgow, is known to have been in Raqqa helping to organise religious patrols . It has previously been thought that women have travelled to Iraq and Syria to join ISIS ranks as wives, but ICSR's findings suggest they are playing a more active role. ICSR research fellow Melanie Smith, who heads the first known database of female foreign fighters, told The Observer: 'British women tend to incite [attacks], they say to people that can’t move to the Islamic State: ""Why not carry out something at home?"" 'That’s a common message: if you can’t leave your family behind or afford to move to Syria then carry out something.' Ms Smith added that women have often been recruited in the past to carry out suicide attacks. School inspectors are also expected to warn that children are still at risk from Islamic extremism, despite a crack down in the wake of the Trojan Horse scandal. Four separate investigations were conducted last year into allegations in Birmingham, which were originally sparked by the 'Trojan Horse' letter - now widely believed to be a hoax - that referred to an alleged plot by hardline Muslims to seize control of a number of school governing boards in the city. In June, Ofsted issued a damning verdict on the running of a number of Birmingham's schools and declared five failing, placing them into special measures. These schools were Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School and Park View Academy - all run by the Park View Educational Trust (PVET) - as well as Oldknow Academy and Saltley School. In an update published in September, Ofsted said that these schools had not improved, with  chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw saying that 'very little action' had been taken to address the serious concerns raised about each school's performance, amid slow progress in appointing new governors and senior leaders. Sir Michael is expected to warn a meeting of the education select committee later this month that he is still 'very concerned' about a continued risk of extremism in schools, Whitehall sources told The Sunday Times. Twins Salma (left) and Zahra Halane (right), both 16, fled their home in Chorlton, Manchester, to follow their brother to Syria - where it is believed they have married IS fighters . Nearly half of the 4,000 referrals to the Government's Channel programme, which aims to target children and adults who are vulnerable to radicalisation before they become terrorists, have reportedly been under 18. Some have these have been as a result of teachers cracking down on pupils feared to be at risk of fleeing the UK to fight in Syria. One headteacher said four children at her north London school had been reported to the Prevent programme, of which Channel is a part, including a 16-year-old girl who wanted to fundraise for ISIS, and a 15-year-old boy who had made a 'throwaway' comment about fighting in Syria.

The Vermont-based ice-cream company, known for standing up for liberal issues, slammed the ‘immoral’ inequality between classes in the U.S. It followed House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi backing the movement as the political debate around the protests intensified. Ice-cream: Ben & Jerry’s said it has the ‘deepest admiration’ for protesters because of the U.S. unemployment crisis and rising cost of higher education . Ben & Jerry’s said it has the ‘deepest admiration’ for protesters because of the U.S. unemployment crisis and rising cost of higher education. ‘We know that words are relatively easy but we wanted to act quickly to demonstrate our support,’ a statement on its website said. ‘We realise that Occupy Wall Street is calling for systemic change. ‘We support this call to action and are honoured to join you in this call to take back our nation and democracy.’ Liberal attitudes: Ben & Jerry's co-founders Ben Cohen, left, and Jerry Greenfield, right, are known for giving away free ice-cream (file picture) Ben & Jerry's, which is part of the Unilever conglomerate, is well-known as an outspoken anti-capitalist company. 'We support this call to action and are honoured to join you in this call to take back our nation and democracy' Ben & Jerry's board of directors . ‘We seek and support nonviolent ways to achieve peace and justice,’ its mission statement on the Unilever website reads. ‘We believe government resources are more productively used in meeting human needs than in building and maintaining weapons systems.’ It was founded in 1978 and two years ago launched a 'Hubby Hubby' ice-cream in support of same-sex marriage. Big protest: A large group of protesters affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement attempted to cross the Brooklyn Bridge on October 1 . The company also launched a 'Yes Pecan' flavour to celebrate Barack Obama's becoming U.S. president. Ben & Jerry’s often holds free ice-cream giveaways - so Occupy Wall Street protesters will be hoping that will be the case again here. It comes as concerns were raised that the protesters' New York camp in Zuccotti Park is being infiltrated by opportunists looking for sex and drugs. The National Air and Space Museum was closed in Washington D.C. on Saturday after anti-war protesters stormed it and were repelled by guards. They were the unlikely pair who used a $5 course in ice-cream making to become one of America's most iconic success stories in recent decades. Ben Greenfield and Jerry . Cohen set up a business with $12,000 in 1978, and it turned into one of the . most well-known ice-cream firms worldwide. The Vermont company tries to promote 'linked prosperity', so it is big on ethical business practices, sustainable growth and being socially responsible. It became a multimillion-dollar publicly traded company before being bought by conglomerate Unilever for a whopping $326million in 2000. Mr Cohen and Mr Greenfield kept away from the running of the company, but they often help out at openings of new stores. The duo were disillusioned that Unilever had not vigorously pursued the mission of corporate social responsibility it accepted with the purchase. But they have maintained their political affiliation despite the sell-out, and Unilever has brought out its own liberal flavours over the last two years. The 'Hubby Hubby' ice-cream was launched in 2009 to support same-sex marriage and 'Yes Pecan' marked Barack Obama's presidential election. But it caused a stir with its latest creation, 'Schweddy Balls', which was boycotted by a leading mothers' organisation who branded it 'vulgar'.","Ice-cream firm known for standing up for liberal issues .

 In what seems like a plot straight out of a low-budget science-fiction film, scientists have revived a giant virus that was buried in Siberian ice for 30,000 years — and it is still infectious. Its targets, fortunately, are amoebae, but the researchers suggest that as Earth's ice melts, this could trigger the return of other ancient viruses, with potential risks for human health. 
  
 “This guy is 150 times less compacted than any bacteriophage. We don’t understand anything anymore!” 
  
 The newly thawed virus is the biggest one ever found. At 1.5 micrometres long, it is comparable in size to a small bacterium. Evolutionary biologists Jean-Michel Claverie and Chantal Abergel, the husband-and-wife team at Aix-Marseille University in France who led the work, named it Pithovirus sibericum, inspired by the Greek word 'pithos' for the large container used by the ancient Greeks to store wine and food. “We’re French, so we had to put wine in the story,” says Claverie. The results are published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1. 
  
 Claverie and Abergel have helped to discover other so-called giant viruses — including the first, called Mimivirus, in 20032, and two others, known as Pandoraviruses, last year3 (see 'Giant viruses open Pandora's box'). “Once again, this group has opened our eyes to the enormous diversity that exists in giant viruses,” says Curtis Suttle, a virologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, who was not involved in the work. 
  
 Two years ago, Claverie and Abergel's team learned that scientists in Russia had resurrected an ancient plant from fruits buried in 30,000-year-old Siberian permafrost4. “If it was possible to revive a plant, I wondered if it was possible to revive a virus,” says Claverie. Using permafrost samples provided by the Russian team, they fished for giant viruses by using amoebae — the typical targets of these pathogens — as bait. The amoebae started dying, and the team found giant-virus particles inside them. 
  
 Under a microscope, Pithovirus appears as a thick-walled oval with an opening at one end, much like the Pandoraviruses. But despite their similar shapes, Abergel notes that “they are totally different viruses”. 
  
 Julia Bartoli & Chantal Abergel; Information Génomique et Structurale, CNRS-AMU 
  
 Surprising properties 
  
 Pithovirus has a ‘cork’ with a honeycomb structure capping its opening (see electron-microscope image). It copies itself by building replication ‘factories’ in its host’s cytoplasm, rather than by taking over the nucleus, as most viruses do. Only one-third of its proteins bear any similarity to those of other viruses. And, to the team’s surprise, its genome is much smaller than those of the Pandoraviruses, despite its larger size. 
  
 “That huge particle is basically empty,” says Claverie. “We thought it was a property of viruses that they pack DNA extremely tightly into the smallest particle possible, but this guy is 150 times less compacted than any bacteriophage [viruses that infect bacteria]. We don’t understand anything anymore!” 
  
 Although giant viruses almost always target amoebae, Christelle Desnues, a virologist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Marseilles, last year discovered5 signs that another giant virus, Marseillevirus, had infected an 11-month-old boy. He had been hospitalized with inflamed lymph nodes, and Desnues's team discovered traces of Marseillevirus DNA in his blood, and the virus itself in the a node. “It is clear that giant viruses cannot be seen as stand-alone freaks of nature,” she says. “They constitute an integral part of the virosphere with implications in diversity, evolution and even human health.” 
  
 Claverie and Abergel are concerned that rising global temperatures, along with mining and drilling operations in the Arctic, could thaw out many more ancient viruses that are still infectious and that could conceivably pose a threat to human health. 
  
 But Suttle points out that people already inhale thousands of viruses every day, and swallow billions whenever they swim in the sea. The idea that melting ice would release harmful viruses, and that those viruses would circulate extensively enough to affect human health, “stretches scientific rationality to the breaking point”, he says. “I would be much more concerned about the hundreds of millions of people who will be displaced by rising sea levels.” ||||| Image copyright CNRS-AMU Image caption The virus was inactive for more than 30,000 years until it was revived in a laboratory in France 
  
 An ancient virus has ""come back to life"" after lying dormant for at least 30,000 years, scientists say. 
  
 It was found frozen in a deep layer of the Siberian permafrost, but after it thawed it became infectious once again. 
  
 The French scientists say the contagion poses no danger to humans or animals, but other viruses could be unleashed as the ground becomes exposed. 
  
 The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). 
  
 Professor Jean-Michel Claverie, from the National Centre of Scientific Research (CNRS) at the University of Aix-Marseille in France, said: ""This is the first time we've seen a virus that's still infectious after this length of time."" 
  
 Biggest virus 
  
 The ancient pathogen was discovered buried 30m (100ft) down in the frozen ground. 
  
 Called Pithovirus sibericum, it belongs to a class of giant viruses that were discovered 10 years ago. 
  
 Image copyright CNRS-AMU Image caption The virus infects amoebas but does not attack human or animal cells 
  
 These are all so large that, unlike other viruses, they can be seen under a microscope. And this one, measuring 1.5 micrometres in length, is the biggest that has ever been found. 
  
 The last time it infected anything was more than 30,000 years ago, but in the laboratory it has sprung to life once again. 
  
 Tests show that it attacks amoebas, which are single-celled organisms, but does not infect humans or other animals. 
  
 Co-author Dr Chantal Abergel, also from the CNRS, said: ""It comes into the cell, multiplies and finally kills the cell. It is able to kill the amoeba - but it won't infect a human cell."" 
  
 However, the researchers believe that other more deadly pathogens could be locked in Siberia's permafrost. 
  
 ""We are addressing this issue by sequencing the DNA that is present in those layers,"" said Dr Abergel. 
  
 ""This would be the best way to work out what is dangerous in there."" 
  
 'Recipe for disaster' 
  
 The researchers say this region is under threat. Since the 1970s, the permafrost has retreated and reduced in thickness, and climate change projections suggest it will decrease further. 
  
 It has also become more accessible, and is being eyed for its natural resources. 
  
 Prof Claverie warns that exposing the deep layers could expose new viral threats. 
  
 Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Professor Jean-Michel Claverie: Large viruses suggest that the Earth may have ""multiple"" origins of life 
  
 He said: ""It is a recipe for disaster. If you start having industrial explorations, people will start to move around the deep permafrost layers. Through mining and drilling, those old layers will be penetrated and this is where the danger is coming from."" 
  
 He told BBC News that ancient strains of the smallpox virus, which was declared eradicated 30 years ago, could pose a risk. 
  
 ""If it is true that these viruses survive in the same way those amoeba viruses survive, then smallpox is not eradicated from the planet - only the surface,"" he said. 
  
 ""By going deeper we may reactivate the possibility that smallpox could become again a disease of humans in modern times."" 
  
 Finding a virus still capable of infecting its host after such a long time is still pretty astounding Prof Jonathan Ball, University of Nottingham 
  
 However, it is not yet clear whether all viruses could become active again after being frozen for thousands or even millions of years. 
  
 ""That's the six million dollar question,"" said Professor Jonathan Ball, a virologist from the University of Nottingham, who was commenting on the research. 
  
 ""Finding a virus still capable of infecting its host after such a long time is still pretty astounding - but just how long other viruses could remain viable in permafrost is anyone's guess. It will depend a lot on the actual virus. I doubt they are all as robust as this one."" 
  
 He added: ""We freeze viruses in the laboratory to preserve them for the future. If they have a lipid envelope - like flu or HIV, for example - then they are a bit more fragile, but the viruses with an external protein shell - like foot and mouth and common cold viruses - survive better. 
  
 ""But it's the freezing-thawing that poses the problems, because as the ice forms then melts there's a physical damaging effect. If they do survive this, then they need to find a host to infect and they need to find them pretty fast.""

 The newfound virus, although invisible to the naked eye, is the biggest on Earth -- larger even than many bacteria and some regular cells -- and may be a new branch of a giant-virus family tree. 
  
 It poses no danger to people, infecting only one-celled creatures called amoebas. But the scientists who identified the new super-virus say their work shows that humans who disturb permafrost, or frozen soil, may encounter viruses that aren't as benign. It's a growing possibility as climate change warms the far north. 
  
 The permafrost may harbor viruses harmful to humans or animals, and ""at the moment, there's no reason to believe they (aren't) also resistant for a long time under the same conditions,"" says study author Jean-Michel Claverie of Aix-Marseille University in France. Now that the loss of sea ice has made mineral-rich north Siberia more accessible, ""there will be people where there were no people before, and those people are going to manipulate and disturb those (soil) layers that have not been disturbed for a million years."" 
  
 The unlikely source of the new microbe is a layer of permafrost 100 feet beneath the treeless tundra in northeastern Russia. The soil has been frozen for thousands of years, shielded from the oxygen and light that degrade living material. 
  
 Hoping the permafrost might have made a safe haven for prehistoric viruses, the researchers added some excavated material to colonies of amoebas, tiny, blobby organisms that live in water and soil. Some of the amoebas burst and died, suggesting they'd been infected by a virus. That virus was a fat, elongated giant, according to the new study. The scientists christened it Pithovirus, from the Greek word ""pithos,"" a large ceramic storage barrel used in ancient times, they say in this week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
  
 Pithovirus is bigger than any other giant virus and 10 to 20 times larger than ordinary viruses but still much smaller than a grain of sand. 
  
 As for how giant viruses evolved, Claverie says, ""frankly, at the moment, your guess is as good as ours.""

Pithovirus sibericum, a member of a recently discovered class of giant viruses, was found 100 feet deep in the frozen ground. It only infects amoebas, but the researchers who uncovered it fear that plenty more ancient viruses are locked into the permafrost and could be unleashed as it thaws, Nature reports. The region is becoming both warmer and more accessible, which ""is a recipe for disaster,"" one of the researchers says. ""If you start having industrial explorations, people will start to move around the deep permafrost layers. Through mining and drilling, those old layers will be penetrated and this is where the danger is coming from,"" he tells the BBC, warning that ""if it is true that these viruses survive in the same way those amoeba viruses survive, then smallpox is not eradicated from the planet—only the surface."" It's not clear, however, whether other viruses are as robust as the Siberian giant, which USA Today notes is as many as 20 times bigger than a typical virus but still dwarfed by a grain of sand. Explain the leaders of the team behind the discovery, ""'Giant' viruses are loosely defined as the ones that you can see under a regular microscope."""

"(CNN) -- France will host golf's Ryder Cup for the first time in 2018, it was announced Tuesday. Le Golf National course, on the outskirts of the capital Paris, was chosen to stage the 42nd edition of the biannual competition between Europe and the United States ahead of Germany, Portugal, Netherlands and favorites Spain. There had been calls for the tournament to be given to Spain in memory of golfing great Seve Ballesteros, who died after a long battle with cancer earlier this month. The five-time major winner was patron of the Madrid bid. But the European Tour resisted the emotional draw of the Spanish bid, much to the delight of the French delegation. Water hazard! $500 million floating golf course planned for Maldives . They have promised to boost the sport at grass roots level by building 100 urban courses in the country and pledged to increase the number of registered players by 300,000 to 700,000 by 2022. Every registered golfer in France donated one euro ($1.41) to the cause and now the country can expect the big financial bonus from business and tourism that comes with hosting the event. Richard Hills, Europe's Ryder Cup Director, told the European Tour's official web site: ""We have one worthy gold medallist in France, who gave us the confidence to believe that they will stage a truly memorable Ryder Cup in seven years time. ""France, as the successful nation, will now be entering into a multi-faceted relationship with Ryder Cup Europe, lasting a minimum of 12 years and benefiting many aspects of golf at all levels. ""All of us at Ryder Cup Europe look forward to working closely with the French Ryder Cup 2018 team in the coming years."" The announcement was celebrated heartily by the French delegation, which included golfers Thomas Levet and Jean Van de Velde, who represented Europe in the 2004 and 1999 Ryder Cups respectively. The last, thrilling, installment, in 2010, was won by Europe at Celtic Manor in Wales, when captain Colin Montgomerie led his team to victory by 14 1/2 points to 13 1/2. Pascal Grizot, chairman of the French Ryder Cup bid, said: ""We've always believed it could happen. My greatest satisfaction is to have brought everyone together to believe it too. ""French golf united and this did not go unnoticed by the European Tour. This huge victory is one for everyone connected to French golf."" Regarding Ballesteros he added: ""We all remember Severiano Ballesteros as an icon in our sport and someone who epitomized the spirit of the Ryder Cup. He is in our thoughts today."" Georges Barbaret, President of the French Golf Federation, added: ""I can't wait for 2018. We have always believed in the link between culture and sport which I'm sure will make the Ryder Cup in France a unique event that will leave everlasting memories.""","France have won the right to host golf's Ryder Cup in 2018 .

"A British forensic archaeologist has unearthed fresh evidence to prove the existence of mass graves at the Nazi death camp Treblinka - scuppering the claims of Holocaust deniers who say it was merely a transit camp. Some 800,000 Jews were killed at the site, in north east Poland, during the Second World War but a lack of physical evidence in the area has been exploited by Holocaust deniers. Forensic archaeologist Caroline Sturdy Colls has now undertaken the first co-ordinated scientific attempt to locate the graves. Treblinka death camp in Poland where 17,000 Stone Memorial is one of the few reminders of the horrific events of the past . As Jewish religious law forbids disturbing burial sites, she and her team from the University of Birmingham have used 'ground-penetrating radar'. Her work at the site, where the Nazis tried to destroy all traces of industrial-scale killing, is being followed in forthcoming Radio 4 documentary The Hidden Graves Of The Holocaust. Sturdy Colls said: 'All the history books state that Treblinka was destroyed by the Nazis but the survey has demonstrated that simply isn’t the case. 'I’ve identified a number of buried pits using geophysical techniques. These are considerable in size, and very deep, one in particular is 26 by 17 metres.' The programme’s presenter says that the pits contain the burnt remains of thousands of bodies. The forensic archaeologist, who has now presented her findings to the authorities responsible for the memorial at Treblinka, added: 'I really hope this is the first stage in a long-term programme to seek out those hidden graves of the Holocaust.' Survivor Kalman Taigman remembers his arrival at the camp’s railway station, packed into a cattle wagon. 'I . was with my mother. We were about 100 people in a wagon. They opened . the doors, firing guns and hitting us, and sent us into a yard. I ran . with my mother and tried to calm her. 'They . told me to leave my mother but I didn’t do it quickly and I was hit on . the head. When I got up, she was gone. She went with all the rest of the . women to the gas chamber.' Treblinka was a Nazi death camp in occupied Poland near the village of Treblinka during World War II . The camp was constructed as part of Operation Reinhard . Treblinka operated between July 23, 1942 and October 19, 1943 . During this time, approximately 850,000 men, women and children were killed at Treblinka. This figure includes more than 800,000 Jews, as well as a few thousand Romani people . The camp, which was operated by the SS and Eastern European Trawnikis, was split into two sections named Treblinka I and II . Treblinka I was designed for forced-labour center . Treblinka II was designed as a death factory with more than 99 per . cent of all arrivals being immediately sent to its gas chambers. Treblinka II ended operations on October 19, 1943 following a revolt by its Sonderkommandos. Beginning in March 1942, the SS implemented Sonderaktion 1005 to . cover up the murder of millions of people during Aktion Reinhard. There actions were so comprehensive that ever since the end of the Second World War, Holocaust deniers have used the site as evidence of misinformation about Nazi genocide. They claim the site was merely a transit camp - a myth now debunked by the latest discoveries of mass graves.","'Ground penetrating radar' used because Jewish burial sites cannot be disturbed .

An off-duty police officer shot dead while tackling a psychotic gunman has been named the bravest officer in England and Wales. Pc Ian Dibell, 41, was hit at point blank range as he tried to stop Peter Reeve, 64, gunning down his neighbours. Just minutes earlier the paranoid gunman fired seven times at his neighbour and his girlfriend in the communal hallway of their home. Pc Ian Dibell, left, who has been posthumously given a national bravery award . after he was shot dead when he tried to wrestle a weapon from deranged . gunman  Peter Reeve, right . The Essex officer’s self-sacrifice was honoured at the Police Bravery Awards, organised by the Police Federation of England and Wales. Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May joined dozens of police officers at the annual event in Central London. Among them were frontline officers who tackled armed robbers, rescued people from burning buildings and dived in freezing water to save drowning children. Mr Cameron said it is ‘humbling’ to read the extraordinary acts of heroism undertaken by officers in the line of duty. ‘Every single day, around our country, the police put themselves in harm’s way to keep us safe,’ he said. ‘Without the rule of law, there is no freedom worth its name – and it is right that we recognise the work of those who do so much to uphold it.’ ‘Britain’s police are the best in the world, ordinary men and women who do extraordinary things.’ Theresa May honoured Pc Dibell at the London event . The awards come during a tense week . for relations between the police and the Government amid further . fall-out from ‘Plebgate’ Andrew Mitchell affair. Mr Cameron said his Tory party . colleague, who rowed with officers at the gates of Downing Street . deserves an apology over his treatment by three senior police . representatives. Pc Dibell was killed in an extraordinary confrontation a short distance from his home in Clacton, Essex, in July last year. The . officer walked out of his home to see Reeve chasing his neighbour in . his car while firing a pistol at him through the windscreen. Grabbing his warrant card to put himself on duty, Pc Dibell ran towards the car and dived through the driver’s side window. Witnesses . described hearing a loud bang before the officer fell to the road, . clutching his chest. He died at the scene from his injuries. Reeve then ran over his neighbour – who escaped with minor injuries – and crashed his car before travelling to a village graveyard where he turned the gun on himself. Mrs May said: ‘Ian Dibell’s death is a reminder not just of the bravery police officers show on a daily basis, but also the depth of their commitment to public service. ‘Pc Dibell was off-duty when he stepped in to help a neighbour in distress. He could have walked away, but he chose to put himself in harm’s way. ‘His bravery, and that shown by thousands of his colleagues up and down the country, is yet another reminder that we have the best police officers in the world.’ Steve Williams, who leads the Police Federation, said:  ‘For every act of courage and bravery recognised here today there are hundreds more that occur in our communities every day that go unrecognised. ‘Officers put others’ lives before their own.  Sadly, as our winner’s story highlights, this can have tragic consequences. ‘Pc Ian Dibell was a valiant team player, his bravery on that fateful day typifies his whole life – always putting others before himself.’ :: Merseyside Pcs Nathan Jackman and Peter Stevens who tackled a violent knifeman after he attacked a man and a woman. :: Off-duty Pc Sara Widdrington, from North Yorkshire, who fearlessly tackled a gunman in a local store while shopping with her son. :: West Midlands Pcs Stephen Fletcher and Rory Stuart-Knill who were ambushed by a masked gang of up to 40 people armed with petrol bombs during the 2011 riots. :: Pc Martin Bentley, of Norfolk who pursued and caught a violent armed wife-beater despite being stabbed. :: Pc Alun Morgan, of Dyfed Powys Police, who dived into freezing quarry waters to rescue a drowning 15-year-old boy. :: Pc Nicholas French, of Gloucestershire, who single-handedly tackled a man armed with a knife who was trying to kill his wife in a garage. :: Met Pcs Stephen Barker, Thomas Harding, Shumal Haque, Alastair Hinchliff and Andrew Robb who suffered horrific injuries when they confronted a deranged knifeman in a butcher.","Pc Ian Dibell died while tackling gunman who was shooting his neighbours .

But forget felines -- it's equine beasts that really stir the emotions of the head of world football's governing body, Sepp Blatter. FIFA president since 1998 and bidding for a fifth term in the post, horses have always played a big part in the 78-year-old's life. ""When I was a young boy in my home city of Visp, which is a very small village, our neighbors, our uncles and especially my godfather had a horse,"" Blatter told CNN Equestrian, reflecting on his Swiss childhood.

""I was also in the Swiss Army as a high-level officer, I was a commander of a regiment -- definitely [there] you have contact with horses."" Blatter, who has been involved with FIFA since 1975, was recently a special guest at the CSI Zurich horse show. It's an event the Swiss has always made room for in his diary despite the challenge of running football's world governing body. ""This is what we like in football -- connecting people,"" Blatter said, comparing the world of equestrian and football. ""And you have seen the public, the public is happy with that. Because it's the big presentation, they listen, they listen. ""And here [at the horse show] they go, it's like football. It's like a football game. And I like that."" FIFA even sponsors a spin-off event at the CSI Zurich show, involving parents and children competing together as a team in horse jumping and with a ball at their feet. ""Sepp Blatter is a good friend of us,"" said CSI Zurich co-president Rolf Theiler. ""I remember 15 years ago, it was the first time he was at the horse show and he saw the spectators, he saw the horses and said, 'FIFA must be a sponsor at the horse show.' ""I said, 'Sepp is that possible?' and he said, 'I will do sponsoring at the horse show with FIFA.' It's fantastic."" The FIFA chief added: ""It's a family prize and this is wonderful. It's not about who's the best, but the best combination."" He might have a special place in his heart for horses, but Blatter admits to having always preferred to admire them from afar rather than jump on board one.

Jason Sudeikis reprised his role as Romney during the cold open, sneaking dairy products on the back of his expansive balcony. ‘Darn it all to heck,’ he began. Numerous members of his family – including Kate McKinnon as his wife Ann and Taran Killam as his sons Tag, Matt, and Josh – came outside to try and comfort him, to no avail. Killam as Tag said that his father’s loss made him want to ‘punch America in the face.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

SNL took it aim on the Republican presidential candidate, after he lost the Electoral College vote tally 332 to 206 in Tuesday’s election. In the skit, Romney’s family was throwing a dignified post-election soiree, but Sudeikis had retired to the balcony to chug Vitamin D milk. Romney himself was pictured with a gallon of chocolate milk following the disappointing loss. Sudeikis’ son, Killam as Tag Romney, came out to ask what more he wanted to accomplish. ‘I have so much I want to do,’ Sudeikis said. ‘I want to find out how mayonnaise is made.’ After ‘cracking open’ another carton of milk, Killam as Matt comes out, begging his father to come into the house. ‘Paul Ryan is doing feats of strength in the living room,’ he said. Sudeikis responded with vitriol. ‘I would’ve liked to see him carry Wisconsin.’ A concerned Killam then asked, ‘Have you been drinking? You smell like a dairy.’ Sudeikis offers his son a drink, but Killam sounds horrified. ‘I’m only 38!’ he said. A third son, Josh, tries to entice his father into the party. ‘Donald Trump is doing a very amusing thing where he’s racist,’ Killam said.

But it’s not until McKinnon comes out again that Sudeikis really gets fired up. He kisses her on the lips, causing McKinnon to say in shock: ‘My, oh my, what has gotten into you?’ Sudeikis responds: ‘Oh, I don’t know, about 10 gallons of milk.’ On Weekend Update, Seth Meyers celebrated ‘four...more…years…of gridlock,’ showing pictures of Republicans Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner. Noting how the president won many unemployed and student voters, Meyers noted: ‘Basically, Obama became president the same way Budweiser became the king of beer.’ Meyers also commented on the David Petraeus scandal, noting the name of biographer Paula Broadwell’s biography on him, entitled ‘All In.’ ‘When they first started working on the book,’ Meyers said, ‘it was called “Just The Tip.”’ Meyers was joined by Jay Pharoah, playing the newly re-elected President Obama.

"(CNN) -- As warring sides prepared to hold their first face-to-face talks to end weeks of ethnic fighting in the world's newest country, clashes flared around a key town Sunday. Nhial Majak Nhial, the mayor of Bor, told CNN that rebel troops had been driven away from his town, which has exchanged hands several times during three weeks of violence that has killed hundreds and forced about 200,000 people from their homes. Defense Minister Kuol Manyang said government forces tried to take back the disputed town but were forced to retreat to a military base eight miles away after rebels ambushed them. Brig. Gen. Abraham Jongroor was killed and several officers were wounded when rebels attacked, the defense minister said. Helicopters airlifted dozens of injured government troops to a military hospital in Juba, about 125 miles (200 kilometers) away. Bor, capital of the oil-rich Jonglei state, has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting during the violence, as military forces have battled the rebel fighters. ""Their technique of fighting is numbers -- they are using numbers against capable and well-trained government troops,"" Nhial said. ""Many of their men, some even children, have died."" President Salva Kiir and the rebels' leader, former Vice President Riek Machar, have sent delegations to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, for talks on a possible ceasefire. Face-to-face negotiations were scheduled to begin on Sunday but now are expected to start Monday morning, said Mahboub Maalim, executive secretary of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, a regional group mediating the talks. Mediators meet both sides . While neither Kiir nor Machar are in Addis Ababa, home of the African Union, group representatives have gathered and are talking amongst themselves on the sidelines, Maalim said. ""A lot of discussing and discussions going on for sure... we are ready to start face-to-face anytime, but we have to wait on the groups to be ready,"" he said. The talks will focus on the cessation of hostilities and negative propaganda, the granting of access to monitors and to humanitarian aid workers, and the question of detainees, Maalim said on Saturday. The proxy talks have been attended by special envoys to IGAD; the heads of negotiating teams of the two South Sudanese parties; Maalim; and the ministers of foreign affairs of Ethiopia and Kenya. No breakthrough has come yet despite pressure on Kiir and Machar from African and Western powers to end the conflict. So far, the mediators met with representatives of both delegations to try to pin down the issues and set out a framework for the talks. Speaking during a visit to Israel, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the negotiations needed to be ""serious."" ""They cannot be a delay gimmick in order to continue the fighting and try to find advantage on the ground at the expense of the people of South Sudan,"" he said. ""We will work to apply international pressure to any elements that attempt to use force to seize power. That is not acceptable."" Ethnic tensions . But as the two sides' teams negotiate, fighting has continued in their country. So far the violence has claimed more than 1,000 lives and displaced about 200,000 others. Humanitarian agencies have warned that the estimated 200,000 who have fled to makeshift camps are facing dire conditions, with many lacking clean water and sanitation in makeshift camps. The fighting began in Juba on December 15 but quickly spread across the country, with reports of mass killings soon emerging. Kiir, from the Dinka ethnic group, accused troops loyal to Machar, from the Nuer community, of trying to launch a coup. The two have long been political rivals, and Kiir dismissed Machar, along with the Cabinet, in July. Although the conflict began as a political power struggle, it has taken on an ethnic dimension and includes evidence of ethnically targeted killings, according to the U.N. mission in South Sudan. Some observers have said both sides may want to gain the upper hand militarily before beginning to discuss a possible cease-fire. South Sudan is the world's youngest nation, having seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war.

Wave for the crowds: The Prince and his wife's ride through Ottawa was reminiscent of their wedding procession through the streets of London . Style icon: Kate was in a white Reiss dress that she wore for her official engagement photograph . Pomp and ceremony: The Royal couple find time to share a joke during the celebrations (left) but were solemn and silent for the more formal parts . Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper welcomed William and Kate as 'the world's most famous newlyweds' Today there were another outfit to . wow the crowds including another familiar sight, the cream £159 Nanette . dress by high street store Reiss that she wore for her engagement . portrait. The dress was topped off with a Sylvia Fletcher for Lock and Co hat. Proudly pinned to the Duchess’s dress . was The Queen Mother’s diamond Maple Leaf brooch, given to the late . monarch  by the people of Canada in 1939 and passed down through a . generation of royal women. She accessorised this time with an on-trend Anya Hindmarch tan and coral clutch, in the shape of a fan. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge share a joke as they visit the Canadian Museum of Civilisation . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chat during a citizenship ceremony: Kate's brooch was borrowed from the Queen . At the museum, there were 25 people from 14 countries who became Canadian citizens in front of the Royal couple . Her final outfit was to be unveiled overnight at an evening pop and rock concert. And next week Kate is set to create a . stir again when she dons full ‘western’ dress including jeans, shirt . and cowboy boot at a rodeo in Calgary. On their first full day of . engagements in Ottawa, the launch pad for their gruelling 11 day tour of . Canada and the U.S., the couple attended a Citizenship Ceremony. Popular touch: Kate greets a mother with her newborn baby (left) and receives flowers off some of the crowds outside . Charmed: The couple greeted newly sworn in Canadian citizens who presented them with flags and flowers . Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper . welcomed them to an afternoon program at Parliament Hill as 'the world's . most famous newlyweds' and said they represent 'our unbreakable link . with our past and our unqualified optimism for the future'. The Royal couple watched intently while 25 young . men and women – from vastly different backgrounds and cultures -  became . fully-fledged Canadians. Each took the Oath of Citizenship, professing loyalty to the prince’s grandmother, the Queen. As each new citizen stepped forward, . William presented them with a folded Canadian flag before his wife then . handed over a small hand flag. Then it was off to the official . Canada Day celebrations in an open-topped carriage similar to the one . the couple used on the way back to Buckingham Palace following their . April wedding. The state landau was built in the . 1890s from hand-wrought iron and carved wood. It was bought by Governor . General Earl Grey in 1911 for $4,000 and donated to the nation. But the stifling heat took its toll and Kate’s make-up began to melt. She gestured towards her cheeks and told Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s wife Laureen: ‘I’m just so hot. It’s incredible.’ Hosts: William and Catherine followed by Canada's Governor General David Johnston and his wife Sharon on the escalator (left) as they arrive for the Citizenship Ceremony where they were seated together on stage . Happy couple: Kate and William stand alongside Canada's Governor General David Johnston (left) and Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism Jason Kenney (right) As they arrived, the crowds - many . waving home-made banners saying Canada loves William and Kate - went . wild and their reception was akin to a pop concert. The couple took their places in a . VVIP section and watched the two hour show designed to celebrate the . nation’s 144th birthday and featured both music and military displays. William also gave a short speech to . thunderous applause and high pitched screams in which he thanked the . Canadian people for their welcome. He talked of his and Kate's family ties to Canada - in . French and English, as he had a day earlier. The star attraction: Signs carried by the crowd included 'Canada loves Will and Kate' Prince William said that Kate had learned about . Canada from her late grandfather, 'who held this country dear to his . heart for he trained in Alberta as a young pilot during the Second World . War'. On his side, he spoke of his . grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. The queen, he said, 'has asked me to . convey her warmest good wishes to the people of Canada, and her happy . and abiding memories of being on Parliament Hill with Thee Duke of . Edinburgh one year ago'. The prince referred to his . grandmother as 'the Queen of Canada,' since she remains Canada's head of . state, drawing a loud cheer from the crowd. He said the queen was watching their Canada tour with interest. Aides have told the Mail the couple . have been ‘thrilled and touched’ by the way in which the country – where . the Queen is still head of state – has taken them to their hearts. ‘It’s unbelievable. I don’t any of us expected anything like this,’ they said. Some people had waited through the night to see the Royal couple .

"A demonstration was held at the weekend by animal rights campaigners in Derby over the planned facility near Foston.
Midlands Pig Producers (MPP) said allegations its pigs would be kept in cramped conditions were untrue.
The farm would hold 2,500 sows and 20,000 piglets and use biogas from the slurry to produce electricity.
MPP has finished giving extra information to Derbyshire County Council as part of the planning process.
It said it had addressed concerns about animal welfare and emissions.
A company spokesman said: ""We are astonished at some of the highly misleading claims and accusations.
""Claims that pigs will be crammed into narrow crates are simply not true.
""Our acclaimed 360 Farrowers were named because the sow can turn around 360 degrees at will.
""We urge people to either contact us, or refer to the planning application so that they may ascertain the facts of the matter for themselves.""
About 100 animal rights protesters marched through Derby on Saturday claiming the large-scale development would be cruel to pigs.
Critics said that the only time the pigs would see the outside world would be on their way to slaughter.
It has also been claimed the site could put small-scale farmers in the area out of business.
MPP said the farm would observe the highest welfare standards and pointed out there was already a unit in the UK containing 3,500 sows.
South Derbyshire District Council handed over duties for dealing with the application to the county council because of its waste implications.
If planning permission is given, construction on the farm will take about a year.","The company behind a proposed large-scale pig farm in Derbyshire has hit out at ""misleading"" claims surrounding its plans."
"Nick Clegg wants new laws to protect journalists' sources . Nick Clegg has demanded new laws to ban police from accessing journalists' phone records to identify their sources without a judge's warrant. The Deputy Prime Minister has written to the Home Secretary Theresa May urging her to introduce the new protections before the end of the month. It comes after an official government report found there were not 'adequate safeguards to protect journalistic sources'. Sir Anthony May, the Interception of Communications Commissioner, said the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act – Ripa – left journalists unprotected. His report said: 'It is recommended that judicial authorisation is obtained in cases where communications data is sought to determine the source of journalistic information.' A review of the use of the Ripa surveillance powers was launched in October after alarm was expressed about incidents such as Scotland Yard accessing the phone records of Sun reporter Tom Newton Dunn to find who had leaked information on the Plebgate row. The commissioner found that over a three-year period 19 police forces had sought communications data in relation to 34 investigations into illicit dealings between public officials and journalists. Some 608 applications for such data were authorised, by a ranking officer. But the report stressed that was just 0.1% of the total applications authorised by police under the legislation. It also concluded that police had not used Ripa to circumvent other legislation and forces were not 'randomly trawling communications data relating to journalists in order to identify their sources'. 'Generally speaking, the police forces did not give the question of necessity, proportionality and collateral intrusion sufficient consideration,' the report said. 'They focused on privacy considerations (Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights) and did not give due consideration to freedom of speech (Article 10). 'The current Home Office Code of Practice (and the recently revised draft Code said to provide protection for sensitive professions) do not provide adequate safeguards to protect journalistic sources or prevent unnecessary or disproportionate intrusions.' The Prime Minister's official spokesman said David Cameron accepted the commissioner's recommendation. 'He very much welcomes the report. He believes that the report makes the case well for the judicial oversight it recommends in cases of data comms applications that are relevant to journalistic sources and that is why the Government is accepting that recommendation,' the spokesman said. The Home Secretary Theresa May is under pressure to introduce new laws forcing the police to get a warrant before accessing journalists' phone records . In a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May, Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg called for legislation to be brought forward later this month. 'As you know, I have consistently raised my concerns about the protection of journalists' sources in relation to acquisition of communications data under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act,' Mr Clegg wrote. 'The report published today by the Interception of Communications Commissioner recommends that 'judicial authorisation must be obtained in cases where communications data is sought to determine the source of journalistic information'. 'We have an opportunity to act on this recommendation at report stage of the Serious Crime Bill in the Commons on February 23. I hope that you will look urgently at drafting Government amendments to that effect.'","Deputy Prime Minister has written to the Home Secretary Theresa May .

"Crowds paid their respects to Alessandro Giancaterino, 42, and Gabriele D'Angelo, 31, waiters at the Hotel Rigopiano.
Another body, of a woman, was found on Tuesday, bringing the death toll to 16.
But rescuers continue to search for 13 people still missing, and say there is a chance survivors could be trapped in the hotel bar.
They are trying to punch their way in through the 80cm (2ft 7in) concrete wall, in the hope that some could still be alive in air pockets there.
""We are working on the theory that the avalanche did not necessarily hit or destroy every room and that we haven't yet reached the heart of the structure,"" said a spokesman for the fire service, Luca Cari.
He said rescuers were working around the clock at the remains of the hotel - which in 2009 hosted Hollywood star George Clooney.
So far, 11 people have been found alive following the 120,000-ton avalanche - which police have calculated had the equivalent impact of the hotel being hit by 4,000 fully loaded trucks travelling at over 100 km/h (60 mph).
On Tuesday, first victims were laid to rest - chief waiter Giancaterino in the next village of Farindola, while fellow waiter D'Angelo was being buried a few kilometres away.
Giancaterino was in the hotel at the time as he had offered to stay for a double shift on 18 January to cover a fellow worker who was struggling to get in through the snow drifts, said AP news agency.
""He was a great hard worker. He was very professional,"" said his brother, Massimiliano Giancaterino. ""This is the memory that I want to keep of my brother, beyond obviously the private ones that I keep in my heart.""
At the hotel, rescuers have been able to excavate a path into the hotel which allows access for heavy machinery, said firefighters' spokesman Mr Cari.
They will now try to create a shaft through the thick concrete wall dividing the bar from the kitchen, in the hope that there could be an air pocket - and possible survivors - in the space behind.
As the search continued, a rescue team was sent from the base co-ordinating the avalanche operation to help in an unrelated helicopter crash nearby, public broadcaster Rai reported.
Italian President Sergio Mattarella has called for a ""united effort and common front in the face of disaster"".
But further concerns have been raised about the emergency services' handling of the disaster and authorities have opened an official inquiry into the circumstances of the tragedy.
Details have emerged of an emergency phone call between a restaurant owner and a senior official at the local authority co-ordinating rescues in Pescara. A transcript has been published by Italian daily La Repubblica.
At 18:20 local time (19:20 GMT), after the hotel's collapse, Quintino Marcello tells the official that his chef, Giampiero Parete, who was staying at the Rigopiano, contacted him on Whatsapp five minutes before.
""The Rigopiano hotel has collapsed, there's nothing left. He's there with his wife and little children. Act immediately. Go up there!""
But La Repubblica says the official insists the hotel is fine and that the fire brigade checked it out during the morning. It was a barn containing sheep at a farm that had collapsed, the official says.
Mr Parete had already contacted emergency services some time before, La Repubblica says, but they checked with the hotel owner, Bruno di Tommaso, who told them he was unaware of an avalanche - though crucially he was not at the scene.
Earlier, relatives of the missing complained that the snow-bound hotel should have been evacuated before the avalanche hit late on Wednesday afternoon. One relative, Alessio Feniello, accused authorities of wrongly telling him that his son, Stefano, had been rescued.
It has also emerged that the hotel owner sent the authorities an email asking for help a few hours before the avalanche, saying that guests were ""terrorised by the earthquakes and have decided to stay out in the open"".
Prosecutor are also examining whether environmental risks were properly assessed during the construction and subsequent renovation of the hotel.",The first funerals have been held for those who died in last week's avalanche at a hotel in central Italy.

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| My headline may be a bit misleading. Albert Einstein, the Nobel prize-winning physicist who gave the world the theory of relativity, E = mc2, and the law of the photoelectric effect, obviously had a special brain. So special that when he died in Princeton Hospital, on April 18, 1955, the pathologist on call, Thomas Harvey, stole it. 
  
 Einstein didn’t want his brain or body to be studied; he didn’t want to be worshipped. “He had left behind specific instructions regarding his remains: cremate them, and scatter the ashes secretly in order to discourage idolaters,” writes Brian Burrell in his 2005 book, Postcards from the Brain Museum. 
  
 But Harvey took the brain anyway, without permission from Einstein or his family. “When the fact came to light a few days later, Harvey managed to solicit a reluctant and retroactive blessing from Einstein’s son, Hans Albert, with the now-familiar stipulation that any investigation would be conducted solely in the interest of science,” Burrell writes. 
  
 Harvey soon lost his job at the Princeton hospital and took the brain to Philadelphia, where it was carved into 240 pieces and preserved in celloidin, a hard and rubbery form of cellulose. He divvied up the pieces into two jars and stored them in his basement. 
  
 Just when you think this story can’t get any weirder, it does. As Burrell explains (emphasis mine): 
  
 After [Harvey’s] wife threatened to dispose of the brain, he returned to retrieve it and took it with him to the Midwest. For a time he worked as a medical supervisor in a biological testing lab in Wichita, Kansas, keeping the brain in a cider box stashed under a beer cooler. He moved again, to Weston, Missouri, and practiced medicine while trying to study the brain in his spare time, only to lose his medical license in 1988 after failing a three-day competency exam. He then relocated to Lawrence, Kansas, took an assembly-line job in a plastic-extrusion factory, moved into a second-floor apartment next to a gas station, and befriended a neighbor, the beat poet William Burroughs. The two men routinely met for drinks on Burroughs’s front porch. Harvey would tell stories about the brain, about cutting off chunks to send to researchers around the world. Burroughs, in turn, would boast to visitors that he could have a piece of Einstein any time he wanted. 
  
 (I know, right?!) 
  
 To fast forward a bit: Come 1985, Harvey and collaborators in California published the first study of Einstein’s brain, claiming that it had an abnormal proportion of two types of cells, neurons and glia. That study was followed by five others (the most recent published just this month), reporting additional differences in individual cells or in particular structures in Einstein’s brain. The researchers behind these studies say studying Einstein’s brain could help uncover the neurological underpinnings of intelligence. 
  
 But that premise is nonsense and the studies are bunk, at least according to Terence Hines, a professor of psychology at Pace University. 
  
 A couple of weeks ago, Hines presented a poster at the Cognitive Neuroscience Society annual meeting outlining all of the ways in which each of the six studies is flawed. Some highlights: 
  
 –In the original 1985 report, Harvey and his collaborators found that in Brodmann Area 39 — a region where the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes meet — Einstein’s neuron-to-glia ratio was significantly smaller than it was in the same area in 11 control brains. But the control group was not all that well controlled: the brains came from people age 47 to 80 years old, whereas Einstein died at age 76. The controls brains were also fresh, whereas Einstein’s had been languishing in basements and beer coolers for three decades. Perhaps most problematic, counting cells is a subjective business, and the researchers performing the cell counts were not blind to which tissue was Einstein’s and which was not. 
  
 –In 1996, Harvey partnered with a scientist from Alabama and counted neurons in Einstein’s Brodmann Area 9 — part of the frontal cortex — as well as those of five controls. There were no differences in the number of neurons or the size of neurons, the study found, but Einstein’s tissue was thinner than controls. More densely packed neurons, the authors speculated, means that cell-to-cell messages travel shorter differences, which might mean faster processing speed overall. That’s quite a stretch. As Hines calls out in his poster, the finding was based on just one square millimeter of Einstein’s brain. What’s more, the authors admit to not reporting any of the ways in which Einstein’s brain was similar to controls. 
  
 –In 1999, Harvey and Canadian collaborators got Einstein’s brain into one of the world’s most prestigious medical journals, The Lancet. Based on old photographs that had been taken of Einstein’s brain before it was cut up, the researchers claimed that Einstein had an abnormal folding pattern in part of his parietal lobe, a region that has been linked to mathematical ability. They also reported that his parietal lobes were 15 percent wider, and more symmetrical, than those of control brains. Once again, though, the researchers were not blinded to which photographs showed Einstein’s brain. And though the authors were quick to make links between these supposed differences and Einstein’s mathematical prowess, Hines points out that Einstein wasn’t, in fact, a great mathematician. 
  
 The underlying problem in all of the studies is that they set out to compare a category made up of one person, an N of 1, with a nebulous category of “not this person” and an N of more than 1. With an N of 1, it’s extremely difficult to calculate the statistical variance — the likelihood that, for example, Einstein’s low neuron-to-glia ratio is real and not just a fluke of that particular region and those particular methods. Even if the statistics were sound, you’d still have the problem of attributing skills and behaviors to anatomy. There’s no way to know if X thing in Einstein’s brain made Einstein smart/dyslexic/good at math/you name it, or was just an X thing in his brain. 
  
 It makes me angry to think of all that was wasted in these investigations. There was the monetary cost of the studies — money that could have been spent on work that was not doomed from the outset to fail. There was a personal cost, in that Einstein’s family was essentially strong-armed into agreeing to participate in research that Einstein explicitly did not want to participate in. And there was a public cost, too. In popular-press accounts of these studies over the years, the public was misled about the findings and their supposed scientific value. 
  
 I’ve made this error, too, by the way. In 2012 I wrote an uncritical, cringe-worthy report on preliminary data from a neuroscience conference comparing brain images of Temple Grandin, one of the most famous people with autism, with those of three controls. The researchers claimed to find several distinctive features in Grandin’s brain that could explain her exceptional nonverbal intelligence and her way of thinking in pictures. 
  
 Here’s how smart Einstein was — he understood all too well the public’s obsession with him, our obsession with celebrity and special-ness. He knew that if given the chance, scientists would pore over his brain’s neurons and glia, sulci and gyri, and make grand pronouncements about what makes a genius. And he knew it would be bullshit. 
  
 As Einstein supposedly wrote, but probably didn’t really write, on a blackboard in his Princeton office: “Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.” |||||","– Maybe he just knew how to use it right. A new paper by Pace University psychologist Terence Hines picks apart previous studies that claim to have identified that special something in the makeup of Einstein's brain. Hines reviewed—and chipped away at—several prominent studies that looked at Einstein's brain on a cellular level or in terms of its size and shape. In the case of the former, Hines throws water on a 1985 study that found Einstein’s brain had a noticeably higher proportion of glial cells than those of control brains. The issue, per Hines: The researchers reported on ""four different t-tests,"" only one of which ""was significant at the .05 level."" In actuality, six other dependent measures were examined in four different brain areas during the study. That's a total of 28 comparisons, making that one ""significant"" result unsurprising. Discover reports that Hines suggests a blind test be conducted, where unlabeled slides of Einstein's brain are compared to slides from other brains to see if differences are clearly apparent. The posthumous saga of Einstein’s brain is rich in oddball details: The brain was saved from cremation during the scientist’s 1955 autopsy by Thomas Harvey, who ended up losing his medical license (due to a failed exam, not the brain theft) and becoming drinking buddies with beat poet William Burroughs, per National Geographic; more odd facts here."

"West Point, New York (CNN) -- President Obama said Tuesday that the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan is part of a strategy to reverse the Taliban's momentum and stabilize the country's government. ""There is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the Taliban has gained momentum,"" Obama said at the U.S. Military Academy. ""Al Qaeda has not re-emerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9/11, but they retain their safe-havens along the border. ""And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population. ... In short, the status quo is not sustainable."" Obama said he'd begin sending the additional troops ""at the fastest pace possible"" starting in early 2010 ""with a goal of starting to withdraw forces from the country in July 2011."" The president said additional U.S. forces bolstered by NATO troops ""will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces."" Senior administration officials said Tuesday that Obama has a goal of withdrawing most U.S. forces by the end of his current term, which ends in January 2013. Watch what the new troops will do in Afghanistan . It will be the second increase of U.S. forces in the war-torn Islamic country ordered by Obama since he took office in January. In his speech Tuesday, Obama said his strategy had three objectives: . • Deny al Qaeda a safe haven . • Reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow Afghanistan's government . • Strengthen Afghanistan's security forces and government . The additional troops was one way to achieve these, he said. Other strategies will include holding Afghan government leaders accountable for corruption, focus assistance on areas that could help the lives of Afghans, and securing the country's border with Pakistan. ""We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border,"" Obama said. The president said he rejected the option of committing more forces for an undefined mission of nation-building without any deadlines. ""I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests,"" Obama said. ""Furthermore, the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan."" Obama rejected analogies with the war in Vietnam that divided America in the 1960s and 1970s. ""Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action,"" Obama said. ""Unlike Vietnam, we are not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border."" Obama said the U.S. has no interest in occupying Afghanistan. ""We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens,"" Obama said. ""And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate those who destroy; to strengthen those who build; to hasten the day when our troops will leave; and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner, and never your patron."" Obama spoke to an audience of West Point cadets, staff and guests in outlining his strategy that he has deliberated for months, meeting several times with his national security team. He recognized that some in the audience had fought in Afghanistan, and some would be deployed in the future. ""As your commander in chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of your service,"" he said. The additional U.S. forces ""will increase our ability to train competent Afghan security forces, and to partner with them so that more Afghans can get into the fight,"" Obama said. ""And they will help create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans."" Obama also said he is asking NATO allies to provide more troops, and that he is ""confident that there will be further contributions in the days ahead."" ""Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""Now, we must come together to end this war successfully. For what's at stake is not simply a test of NATO's credibility -- what's at stake is the security of our allies, and the common security of the world."" The new troop deployment would increase the total U.S. commitment to roughly 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, bolstered by more than 40,000 NATO forces. Obama, whom Republicans had accused of ""dithering"" over the decision, concluded the deployment needs to be accelerated to knock back the Taliban, the senior officials said. The push for a speedy deployment is surprising because White House officials who defended Obama's slow pace of coming to a decision had said the Pentagon wouldn't be able to get new troops to Afghanistan that quickly. A Pentagon official noted that, under the new strategy, Obama is ""trying to do it faster"" than the 12-month timeline initially requested by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan. McChrystal wrote in a report in August that a ""failure to gain the initiative and reverse insurgent momentum in the near-term (next 12 months) -- while Afghan security capacity matures -- risks an outcome where defeating the insurgency is no longer possible."" The Pentagon official said Obama's six-month timeline for sending the new troops is ""very aggressive"" and will be challenging for the military to fulfill. The official expressed confidence, however, that the military would successfully carry out the order. Opponents of an increased U.S. troop deployment complain that the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai is corrupt and an unreliable partner. Obama spoke to Karzai for an hour by videoconference Tuesday to discuss the deployment decision, according to a White House statement. ""The president also emphasized that U.S. and international efforts in Afghanistan are not open-ended and must be evaluated toward measurable and achievable goals within the next 18 to 24 months,"" the statement said. Share your views on Obama's Afghanistan decision . The decision to send the troops carries significant political risk for Obama, who will announce it nine days before he travels to Oslo, Norway, to accept the Nobel Peace Prize. His liberal base, which helped him win last year's presidential election, opposes another troop deployment to Afghanistan. In addition, the deployment, expected to cost an extra $30 billion a year, comes amid high unemployment as the economy emerges from a recession. That concerns Democrats and Republicans faced with competing domestic priorities such as health care reform and job creation. U.S.-led troops first invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network's September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The invasion overthrew the ruling Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory, but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught. Taliban fighters have since regrouped in the mountainous region along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other. Al Qaeda's top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region. The conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops.","30,000 troops to be deployed within six months, President Obama says .

"Newlyweds Stacie and Edgar Cobos got more than they bargained during a game drive on their Serengeti Safari Camp in Northern Tanzania. The honeymooners, from Washington DC, were on a game drive when a cheetah got a little too close for comfort - jumping on the car and peering through the open sunroof. The couple had been happily observing the family of cheetahs when the big cats decided to use the car as a perch so they could get a better view of their surroundings. But one cheetah became more interested in the contents of the car than the surrounding plains, peering through the sunroof and, at one moment, looking like it may even try to get inside. As Edgar Cobos stayed stock still looking at the animal from the back seat, the big cat looked right back, before appearing to lose interest. Scroll down for video . Too close for comfort? One cheetah even popped his head into the vehicle through the sunroof . Edgar Cobos remained calm and cool while the gigantic cat lounged just inches from his head . The heart-stopping moment came as the newlyweds were enjoying a safari camp experience with The Luxury Safari Company. The trip involves travelling through the Serengeti with a mobile camp of just six tents, following the migration and wildlife movement around the Serengeti. Guests have the opportunity to camp and dine under the stars of the Kuka Hills in the North Eastern Serengeti, while always being positioned in an exceptional wildlife area. The nature of the safari means holidaymakers can venture further away from other tourists and often get much closer to the animals.

"Workers have been accused of wasting money after choosing to widen a footpath rather than cut back an overgrown hedge so people could get past. The path, which links a main road to pensioner bungalows in Bradford, West Yorkshire, had become blocked due to a hedge running alongside it becoming overgrown. But it is claimed that workmen decided to widen the path so more people had space to pass the rampant overgrown hedge, rather than just prune back its leaves and branches. Scroll down for video . Leslie Howard, next to the path extension laid by workers, rather than them pruning back the nearby overgrown hedge . Leslie Howard, who lives nearby and uses the path often said he was shocked to see workers lay down the tarmac instead of cutting the hedge. The 74-year-old said: 'I couldn't believe it when I saw that instead of cutting the bush back they'd put more tarmac down. 'It's a complete waste of money. I reckon I could have cut the hedge back in half an hour. 'How long does it take to dig out the grass, put hard core down and lay a path?' Mr Howard also added that the new tarmac extension did not even solve the problem because workmen had only dealt with part of the path. Mr Howard, left, said: 'It's a complete waste of money. I reckon I could have cut the hedge back in half an hour . He explained: 'They should come back and cut the hedge back all the way up the path or remove it.' Mr Howard keeps fit by walking to nearby Eastburn, using the path, which runs up a hill towards four bungalows for the elderly.

He said he had first reported the overgrown hedge a few years ago and that time workmen had cut it back. However, a spokesman for the council said they weren't responsible for the new path, adding it was nothing to do with them . He added: 'The path was very wide, but this bush started growing and growing until it went over most of the path. 'You have to walk on the grass verge to get round. I'm fairly fit but I have to step on the grass. 'I've seen kids on their bikes come straight down from the path to the grass then back to the path, which is dangerous if they slip.'

"The tell-all autobiography of Little House On The Prairie author Laura Ingalls Wilder has emerged as a surprise publishing hit, with readers rushing to snap up the gritty account of pioneer life. First published in November by the tiny South Dakota Historical Society Press, Pioneer Girl: The Annotated Autobiography, offers an unvarnished view of life in the Midwest in the 19th century, a marked departure from the bucolic imagery of the beloved Little House series. The not-safe-for-children tales include stark scenes of domestic abuse, love triangles gone awry and a man who lit himself on fire while drunk off whiskey. Scroll down for video . Runaway hit: Readers have been rushing to snap up copies of Laura Ingalls Wilder's no-holds-barred autobiography Pioneer Girl, which hit the shelves in November . Real pioneer girl: A handout photograph shows Little House On The Praire author Laura Ingalls Wilder, whose autobiography depicts an unvarnished view of the 19th century Midwest . Wilder and her daughter Rose Wilder . Lane, herself a well-known author, tried and failed to get an edited . version of the autobiography published throughout the early 1930s. The . original rough draft has been preserved at the Laura Ingalls Wilder . Historic Home and Museum in Mansfield, Missouri, for decades but hadn't . been published. The children's series of 11 novels published between 1932 and 1943 never presented an entirely romanticized version of life on the prairie - in Little House In The Big Woods, Laura and her sister Mary gleefully help dissect the family pig before bouncing its inflated bladder back and forth in the yard. But the series also left out or fictionalized scenes that Wilder deemed unsuitable for kids, including much of the time the family spent in Burr Oak, Iowa, and Walnut Grove, Minnesota, according to Pamela Smith Hill, a Wilder biographer and the lead editor on the autobiography. 'So you can read Pioneer Girl as nonfiction rather than fiction and get a better feeling of how the historical Ingalls family really lived, what their relationships were and how they experienced the American West,' she said. TV hit: Wilder's series of 11 novels published between 1932 and 1943 were adapted for TV in the 1970s. The show ran for nine seasons . Wilder details a scene from her childhood in Burr Oak, in which a neighbor of the Ingalls' pours kerosene throughout his bedroom, sets it on fire and proceeds to drunkenly drag his wife around by her hair before Wilder's father - Pa in the children's books - intervenes. Scenes like that make Wilder's memoir sound like it's filled with scandal and mature themes, 'which isn't exactly true either,' according to Amy Lauters, an associate professor of mass media at Minnesota State University-Mankato. 'It's just that that first version was blunt, it was honest. It was full of the everyday sorts of things that we don't care to think about when we think about history,' Lauters said last August. 'And it's certainly not the fantasized version we saw on Little House on the Prairie the television show.' The autobiography preserves Wilder's original rough draft - misspellings, idiosyncrasies and all - but adds extensive annotations. Little House lovers can learn about the three girls that Wilder combined to create the Nellie Olson character, or how extensive the damage was in Minnesota during the grasshopper plague of the 1870s, which forced Pa in On The Banks Of Plum Creek to set out in search of work. 'In some ways, I came to think of the annotations in Pioneer Girl as almost an encyclopedia about Laura Ingalls Wilder's life and work,' Hill said. Hard knock life: Caroline and Charles Ingalls, known as Ma and Pa in the series, had financial problems and bounced from one apartment to the next . Speaking to AFP this week, Nancy Tystad Koupal, the director of the publishing house, said they decided to release Wilder's first draft because it painted an honest picture of American pioneers' hardscrabble life, warts and all. In the TV show, the character of Laura Ingalls Wilder was played by Melissa Gilbert . 'At the time, life was hard. Violence was typical. It was part of the pioneers' life,' Koupal said. The author's large family struggled financially and could not afford to buy a house of their own, forcing them to bounce from one apartment to the next. 'They had to flee in the middle of the night to avoid paying rent,' Koupal said. In another episode from her adventures in the Midwest, Wilder tells about  a sick woman whose drunk husband tried to rape her. The author only escaped by fighting back. Wilder's books were adapted for TV in 1974 by Michael Landon who also starred on the show. It ran for nine seasons, comprising more than 200 episodes. The 'Little House' books and TV show were enjoyed by several generations of Americans readers and viewers, which could explain the unexpected success of the new memoir. With sales being bolstered by news stories and radio segments about the new book, it has climbed up the Amazon bestseller list, and even briefly overtook Chris Kyle's American Sniper for the top spot last week. As of Wednesday afternoon, Wilder's memoir remained at the top of the US History books list and in fifth spot on the overall list of best sellers. Since its publication two months ago, orders for the autobiography have exploded. Manuscript: The original manuscript of Pioneer Girl was written on tablet paper with lead pencil . An initial print-run of 15,000 was sold out within a few weeks. The historical society then placed orders for another 15,000 followed by another 45,000 books. The editor of the book, Pamela Smith Hill, took it upon herself research the events and dates mentioned in Wilder's original manuscript to make sure all of the information was accurate. 'We had to check if her memory was correct,' Koupal said.'It is her autobiography, but she wrote it when she was 60, and sometimes, memory fails.'","Pioneer Girl: The Annotated Autobiography is original version of author Laura Ingalls Wilder's memoir .

"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- Travelers to China who display flu-like symptoms may be randomly quarantined over concerns of the swine flu virus, the U.S. State Department warned. A child traveling with his parents wears a face mask after they arrive at the Beijing, China, airport. There have been cases of children being separated from parents after either tested positive for the virus, also known as H1N1, a travel alert said Friday. Chinese officials may give medications to minors in such cases without consulting their parents, according to the alert. ""Although the proportion of arriving Americans being quarantined remains low, the random nature of the selection process increases the uncertainty surrounding travel to China,"" the alert said. Swine flu is a respiratory disease of pigs transmitted to humans and caused by type A influenza virus. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite and coughing. There have been about 48,000 confirmed cases worldwide, including 519 in China, according to the World Health Organization. The Chinese government has taken measures to stop the spread of the virus. They include placing passengers who have fever or flu-like symptoms on a seven-day quarantine, the alert said. Others facing quarantine include those sitting close to travelers with symptoms, those with elevated temperatures and those from areas where virus outbreaks have occurred. A 15-year-old from Topeka, Kansas, told CNN on Monday that she was quarantined in Beijing for a week. ""Apparently, I was sitting too close to a man who had a fever on the 14-hour plane ride,"" Kaitlin Hannigan said, adding that she initially thought she had a fever, but her temperature was fine when officials checked it. A day after she arrived in Beijing with an educational group, government officials showed up at her hotel. ""They were wearing quarantine suits, goggles and masks and, like, full body suits and gloves, and said I had to be quarantined for seven days because I came in contact with that guy,"" Hannigan said. Earlier in June, New Orleans, Louisiana, Mayor Ray Nagin was quarantined in Shanghai after possible exposure to the virus. Nagin was headed to Australia on an economic development trip when he was quarantined for four days after sitting beside a passenger who was being treated for suspected swine flu symptoms. Nagin showed no signs of illness. State officials warned Americans traveling to China that they have to follow local quarantines procedures. ""The U.S. Embassy will be unable to influence the duration of stay in quarantine for affected travelers,"" the statement said. The travel alert expires in September.","Travelers to China with flu-like symptoms could face 7-day quarantine .

Becoming a little turned around after a pub crawl could now be a thing of the past for barflies in Leeds, as a dedicated drinker has designed a London Tube-style map that charts bars, restaurants and pubs all over the city. The 'Leeds Oderaround' was created by Steve Lovell, and features a massive 563 locations across the northern city, replacing tube stations with drinking, eating, and lodging establishments. Mr Lovell, 39, spent over a year of his spare time designing the drinker's guide, using both virtual and physical mapping methods to complete the project. The 'Leeds Orderaround' map, drawing from the iconic London Underground design, the map details the locations of 563 pubs and bars in Leeds . Steve Lovell, a former graphic design student, took over a year to create the map, walking dozens of miles in his efforts . The former Leeds University graphic design student clocked up dozens of miles walking the city, and taking virtual street tours. Most of his mapping efforts were to make sure that the pubs he was listing on his map were still open and operational, as many might have been closed or renamed. Mr Lovell said: 'Having always admired the design of the London Underground map and going out in Leeds, I decided to do this project to combine the two. the map could easily be used to chart the routes of a pub crawl, or just more easily locate a pub in the city that you've always wanted to try . Steve Lovell plans to sell the maps on his website for £10 each . 'It's been over a year in development on and off in my spare time. 'It's been deceptively long and hard work, but I'm very happy with the finished result. 'I've had lots of kind comments about it already and it does make me feel quite proud. 'Friends and neighbours have said that they are really impressed with it and when I had my photograph taken complete strangers came up to me and said they really wanted one.' Because the project took over a year to complete, Mr Lovell found that many of the sites he had listed at the start had become obsolete, and so his map required constant updating. Lovell both walked dozens of miles, and used virtual mapping techniques to make make sure that every pub, restaurant and bar was actually open and operational, and that they hadn't changed their name, so that his map was completely correct . He said: 'Since starting the project I've had to remove a lot of pubs that have closed down and even been demolished and that's always sad. 'About a quarter-of-a-mile from my house there was a pub that had been demolished before it had been printed. 'It is quite sad to see so many close and come off the map in the 12 months I have created it. 'But it is also nice to see that some new places are also opening up, but mostly in the city centre. 'When I was putting it together there were lots of places that I wouldn't know about and places that I never even knew existed. 'I can't say I've been to all of the places on the map and probably never will, but I've been to lots of places I didn't know about before as a result of researching and designing this.'

Groups of people drinking strong drinks, with the peer pressure culture of 'downing' drinks meaning that people are stumbling out of bars and into streets to head to the next place, where they are at risk of being hit by cars. This danger was shown in Leeds last year when the former boyfriend of Kelly Brook, Rugby ace Danny Cipriani, drunkenly tumbled into the road while on a pub crawl, and was hit by a bus. Cipriani was treated in Leeds General Hospital, and was pictured days later hobbling out on crutches with various cuts and bruises from his accident.

"Venice, Louisiana (CNN)  -- President Obama on Wednesday proposed a package of measures that would provide at least $58 million in additional funding for oil spill relief efforts and raise the tax that oil companies pay to maintain an emergency fund. In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi requesting congressional approval of the package, Obama said oil giant BP -- which owns the leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico -- was responsible for all cleanup costs. In addition, Obama said, the government would seek full compensation for all damages from BP. ""We cannot allow the potentially protracted pursuit of claims to prevent us from swift action to help those harmed by this spill,"" Obama said in the letter. The proposals would increase by 1 cent the current tax of 8 cents a barrel that oil companies pay into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, and also increase the amounts that could be spent from that fund on single incidents. Efforts to staunch the gusher continued Wednesday. The ""top-hat"" oil containment device has reached the sea floor and should be in position over the wellhead and operational by the end of the week, BP said. A larger containment vessel was unsuccessful in stopping the flow of oil from the gusher about 5,000 feet underwater. The spill is sending 210,000 gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico each day. The ""top-hat"" cofferdam, a 5-foot-tall, 4-foot-diameter structure, weighs less than 2 tons. The structure was deployed by the drill ship Enterprise. BP built the smaller dome after a much larger, four-story containment vessel, designed to cap the larger of two leaks in the well, developed glitches Saturday. Ice-like hydrate crystals formed when gas combined with water and blocked the top of the dome, making it buoyant. The new device would keep most of the water out at the beginning of the capping process and would allow engineers to pump in methanol to keep the hydrates from forming, said Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer for exploration and production. Methanol is a simple alcohol that can be used as an antifreeze. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said the success of this latest attempt to cap the well could be known in the next few days. ""On this Thursday, we should know whether or not this alternative top-hat cofferdam is going to work,"" Salazar said on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""And then the next key date is Saturday, because by Saturday they will have the diagnostics completed through X-rays and gamma rays and pressure ratings to be able to make decisions about what the next steps are."" If attempts to cap the well fail, BP may try to plug the leak by shooting debris -- shredded tires, golf balls and similar objects -- under extremely high pressure into the well's blowout preventer in an attempt to clog it and stop the leak. The blowout preventer has been partially successful in sealing the well, but did not fully close when the rig exploded and sank. Suttles said BP also is drilling a relief well to try to divert the flow to another pipe. ""That started about a week ago,"" Suttles said. ""That work continues. The well is at about 9,000 feet."" It may take up to three months to reach the target area, and progress will slow the deeper the drill bit goes, said David Nagel, executive vice president of BP America. Federal investigators are still trying to determine what caused the explosion that sank the Deepwater Horizon, which was owned by BP contractor Transocean Ltd. The oil rig exploded April 20 and sank two days later, about 50 miles off the southeast coast of Louisiana. BP is legally required to cover economic damages from the spill up to $75 million. But Florida Sen. Bill Nelson has introduced legislation that would raise the liability cap to $10 billion. iReport: Share images from the Gulf . ""If this gusher continues for several months, it's going to cover up the Gulf Coast and it's going to get down into the loop current, and that's going to take it down the Florida Keys and up the east coast of Florida,"" Nelson said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union. ""And you are talking about massive economic loss to our tourism, our beaches, to our fisheries, very possibly disruption of our military testing and training,"" he said.

"Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed the government's decision to end the scheme on a visit to a housing association in Glasgow.
Margaret Thatcher's Tory government introduced the scheme in 1980.
The Scottish government has already scrapped ""right to buy"" for new tenants and it will be abolished altogether in 2017.
Since the opportunity to buy was introduced, 455,000 Scottish properties have been sold.
The Scottish government said that had reduced the number of homes available for cheap rent and increased the waiting lists for properties of this type.
Ms Sturgeon, during a visit to Queens Cross Housing Association, said the move would ""safeguard social housing stock for future generations"".
She added: ""It is absolutely vital that people can access social housing when they need it most. Social housing is under significant pressure and so too are the budgets that support it.
""The Scottish government is doing everything possible to maximise our investment in housing and deliver on our target of 30,000 new, affordable homes over the lifetime of this parliament.
""But, given the pressure on both the housing stock and budgets - and with 400,000 people on waiting lists for social housing - we can no longer afford to see badly needed homes lost to the social sector.""
By Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland news
""Two thirds of residential properties in Scotland are now owned by their occupiers. But there is a big shortage of homes for rent, particularly social housing.
It is mainly for that reason that the Scottish government has restricted the 'right to buy'.
In March 2011, it was scrapped for new tenants and new social housing. From 2017, it will be abolished altogether.
This is in marked contrast to policy in England. In this year's budget, the UK government increased the discount available to tenants in London.
The Chancellor also promised to reduce the qualifying period from five to three years to widen access.
Devolution continues to increase the policy differences between Scotland and other parts of the UK.""
In November last year, a Scottish government consultation revealed that a majority of Scottish councils wanted the right to buy policy scrapped.
The report also showed that many tenants and social landlords wanted it to end.
An opponent of the move is former Scottish Conservative Party leader Annabel Goldie.
She told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that the policy was ""arguably"" one of the most ""socially liberating"" policies to be introduced in Scotland and across the UK.
Miss Goldie added: ""I can still remember the days when people lived in monolithic council house schemes - that is what they were called - and they were afflicted by a postcode prejudice.
""They were apprehensive about disclosing their address because they felt it would negate their chance of getting a job or even being accepted for an interview.
""By offering a tenant the right to buy, you did two things - you first of all introduced a freedom to the individual to make a choice about how they wanted to live, and secondly you stopped them being trapped in that environment - because that is exactly what they were.""
She went on: ""Right to buy freed people from the environmental prison they were in.""
The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations welcomed the Scottish government's announcement.
Its membership manager said: ""Right to buy has had its day and has no place in 21st century Scotland.
""It has been beneficial to a relatively small number of individuals, but clearly a loss to the greater public good. Half a million social rented homes have been lost in the 30 years of this policy in Scotland, very often the better stock in the more popular areas.""
Although the right to buy policy will come to an end in Scotland in 2017, it continues to exist elsewhere in the UK.",The right of council tenants to buy the homes they rent at discounted rates will be abolished in Scotland.

'We have time to figure out what to . do, where we would go and where we would put everything,' Pam Bick, 57, . said. 'I don't want it to come up any more. But I can't stop it.' The . water levels forced evacuations, closed roads, swamped hundreds of . thousands of acres of farmland and shut down much of the upper . Mississippi River to barge traffic. Two . Mississippi River bridges were closed and a third was shut down for a . few hours after 114 barges broke loose Saturday night south of St. Louis . and floated down the fast-moving river toward Jefferson Barracks Bridge . in St. Louis County.

After two days of endless sandbagging, Cottrell thought he could rest . Saturday night, but the constant beeping of heavy equipment outside and . flood worries kept him up. 'I had a rough night last night. I had an anxiety attack,' said Cottrell, who also owns a downtown antique store. Trish . Connelly, 57, was optimistic the town would beat back the river. Her . plan to open a new fine arts gallery downtown this weekend were on hold . “until we know what the river is going to do,” she said.

"(CNN)The popular Pope Francis is taking some hits himself after some lighthearted comments that included a pretend punch to a colleague. The comments came while trying to make the point that free speech should have some limits, including on the right to insult another's faith. Speaking Thursday to reporters on the plane ride to the Philippines, the Pope gestured with a fake punch to demonstrate what he would do if someone were to say ""a swear word against my mother."" Most journalists interpreted it as a joke, not a justification of violence, especially since the Pope had also just forcefully stated that ""one cannot kill in the name of God."" Still, the Vatican felt the need to clarify, in response to a later CNN question about the punch, that his words were ""spoken colloquially"" and consistent with the Pope's ""free style of speech."" I don't for one minute think the Pope is advocating for any type of violence, whether religiously motivated murder or sparring among friends who dis each other's mamas. What concerns me is his apparent belief that religion should have special protection when it comes to free speech. ""One cannot provoke, one cannot insult other people's faith, one cannot make fun of faith,"" he said. ""There is a limit. Every religion has its dignity. ... In freedom of expression there are limits."" The Pope, responding to a general question about the interplay between religious liberty and free expression, was clearly referencing the massacre of journalists at Charlie Hebdo magazine by Islamist militants in Paris last week. Although he did not say the slain cartoonists brought the attack upon themselves because of their satirical criticism of Islam, it's not a huge logical leap to that conclusion and raises the likelihood of such a misinterpretation. Let's just say it's not what most public relations professionals would advise. And while the Pope has been known to talk more informally with reporters on the papal plane (his ""Who am I to judge?"" comment about gay Catholics came on the return flight from Brazil in 2013), he's still on the record and obviously aware that his words will be reported and analyzed. The Pope is not the only prominent Catholic raising the issue. Bill Donahue, a self-appointed spokesman fighting ""anti-Catholicism"" as the president of the New York-based Catholic League, released a statement with the headline, ""Muslims have a right to be angry,"" on the day of the killings. On Thursday, his statement was headlined: ""Pope sides with Catholic League."" Such chutzpah. While no one can match the offensive tone of Donahue, who actually said Charlie Hebdo's Stephane Charbonnier ""didn't understand the role he played in his own death,"" the gist of the Pope's message was the same: Criticism of religion is problematic. As an aside, I'll be curious to see if those who slammed Donahue have the same harsh words for the Pope. Perhaps both of them should take a lesson from the response of another Christian, Jim Wallis, president of Sojourners, a progressive, evangelical community and publication. He had a different suggestion for how people of faith should respond to the Paris attacks: . ""Jesus tells us to bless those who persecute us, to return love for hate and good for evil, and even to love our enemies,"" Wallis wrote. ""Loving your enemies certainly includes supporting the foundational commitment to free speech, and defending the right of free speech, even, or especially, for those who offend you."" I think most American Catholics agree that while blasphemy -- offensive speech against God or religion -- is not particularly nice, it does not follow that it can or should be regulated or outlawed. In the United States, the Supreme Court outlawed blasphemy laws in 1952. I'm hoping the Pope was only offering counsel to his followers, rather than advocating for any sort of legal position. No one has the right not to be offended. Even the Pope.","Heidi Schlumpf: Pope told reporters one can't insult others' faith, expression must have limits .
She says he seems to believe religion should have special protections on  free speech .
Schlumpf: Most U.S. Catholics likely disagree -- no one has right not to be offended, even Pope ."
"The £15m striker, 25, has yet to play this season after  tearing ankle ligaments on the Hammers' pre-season tour of New Zealand.
Carroll has started only 12 Premier League matches during an injury-hit 16-month spell at Upton Park.
""It's been a long, hard road again for Andy and one he's been too familiar with recently, sadly,"" Allardyce said.
""Hopefully he'll have a major impact when he comes back again.""
The striker has returned to training and Allardyce expects the England forward to feature in Under-18 and Under-21 games before a possible return to first-team action in mid-November.
""It'll be another two to three weeks, if he has no niggles or problems, before we talk about playing him in the team at any level,"" he said.
""We'll try to get him through three or four behind-closed-doors games and if that goes all right then we would hope to have him back.""
Allardyce says that the former Newcastle and Liverpool forward returned too soon from the foot injury that kept him sidelined for the first five months of last season.
""Last time we got him back he did his ankle but carried on playing, so this time round we don't want to rush him,"" he said.
Summer signings Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia have impressed up front in Carroll's absence, and, with West Ham lying fourth in the Premier League table, Allardyce says the club can afford to take extra care over his return.
""We're hopefully going to get him back as quick as we can but we're not going to rush him back because, touch wood, there's no desperate need at the moment."" he said.","West Ham manager Sam Allardyce says the club's record signing Andy Carroll could return in ""two to three weeks""."
"New York (CNN) -- Two New York men accused of brutally beating an openly gay man have been indicted on hate crime charges, authorities said. The indictment filed Thursday morning charges defendants Daniel Aleman, 26, and Daniel Rodriguez, 21, both of College Point in Queens, New York, of 14-counts of assault and robbery as a hate crime, according to Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown. If convicted, both men face up to 25 years in prison. Police say the two men shouted ""anti-gay remarks"" while viciously beating victim Jack Price, 49, as he left a 24-hour deli on College Point Boulevard in Queens in October 2009. After the assault, the two men stole Price's wallet and other personal property from his pockets. Price was treated at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens for a broken jaw, several broken ribs, two collapsed lungs and a lacerated spleen. Aleman and Rodriguez are being held without bail. Their arraignment is scheduled for January 25. Ted Kasapis, attorney for Rodriguez, said he doesn't believe prosecutors will be able to prove ""any hate crimes here.""

"A disciplined Blackburn frustrated Liverpool as the Championship side held their Premier League opponents to a scoreless draw and forced an FA Cup quarter-final replay. Gary Bowyer's side kept the Reds plethora of superstars at bay and will host them again at Ewood Road, with his towering striker Rudy Gestede proving tough to contain for Brendan Rodgers' men, especially after the departure on a stretcher by Martin Skrtel following an ugly fall early on. Here, Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler rates every player's performance at Anfield. Blackburn Rovers' Rudy Gestede proved a handful for Liverpool's defence in their FA Cup draw . LIVERPOOL (3-4-2-1) SIMON MIGNOLET - 6.5 . Looked shaky under his first high ball, but settled and produced a fantastic save to keep out a goal-bound header from Baptiste. Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet makes a reflex save after Blackburn's Alex John-Baptiste heads on target . GLEN JOHNSON - 6 . Almost turned a cross into his own goal in the first half but got forward well as Liverpool seized the upper hand. MARTIN SKRTEL - 6 . Knocked out inside two minutes after falling awkwardly when challenging Gestede and carried off on a stretcher. Martin Skrtel gives fans a double thumbs up as he left the pitch on a stretcher after a nasty fall . DEJAN LOVREN - 6 . Had his hands full with Gestede after Skrtel’s exit and struggled with the big Blackburn striker at times. Reds defender Kolo Toure hits this close-range chance into the back of the net but was judged offside . LAZAR MARKOVIC - 6.5 . Lively down the Liverpool right but faded and replaced by Balotelli just before the hour mark. JORDAN HENDERSON - 6.5 . Another reassured display from the Liverpool skipper. Unlucky not to break the deadlock with a late effort. Lazar Markovic (centre) was lively for the Reds down the right side but was replaced by Mario Balotelli . EMRE CAN - 6 . Played in midfield again and looked solid enough without producing anything spectacular. RAHEEM STERLING - 5.5 . Didn’t make as much of an impression as he can and struggled to get into the game. Headed late chance wide. Raheem Sterling turns inside Rovers' Adam Henley during their FA Cup quarter-final on Sunday . PHILIPPE COUTINHO - 5.5 . The little Brazilian has scored some memorable goals recently but didn’t have his shooting boots on, twice firing well off target . ADAM LALLANA - 5 . Guilty of poor distribution in the first half and did not have a big enough impact on the game for a player of his calibre. Adam Lallana appeals for a penalty but he was legally dispossed by Blackburn's Matthew Kilgallon . DANIEL STURRIDGE - 6.5 . Became more of a threat as the game wore on, and had one great effort on goal end of first half, but will be disappointed not to trouble Blackburn more. Subs: Ward, Toure (for Skrtel 11, 6) Lambert, Moreno, Sakho, Balotelli (for Markovic 59, 6), Williams. Booked: Can . Manager: Brendan Rodgers – 5 . Brendan Rodgers (right) issues directions to Raheem Sterling during the frustrating draw . BLACKBURN (4-2-3-1) SIMON EASTWOOD - 7 . Had less to do than he might have expected early on but produced great reflex saves to deny Sturridge and Henderson. ADAM HENLEY - 6.5 . Battled well throughout but fortunate to avoid a booking for a late challenge on Can. Adam Henley gets tight on Sterling during a committed performance from the battling Blackburn defender . MATTHEW KILGALLON - 7.5 . Made some great challenges, including one interception on Lallana in the first half, but rode his luck by holding back Sturridge in the box. ALEX BAPTISTE - 7 . Declared fit after hamstring problem and so nearly emerged as Blackburn’s hero but his header was saved by Mignolet. Defender Alex Baptiste (right) makes a lunging tackle on Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge . Baptiste heads Blackburn's best chance of the match only for it to be denied by Mignolet . MARTIN OLSSON - 6.5 . Kept on his toes by Markovic but coped well on the whole to make sure Liverpool were limited to hopeful balls into the box. LEE WILLIAMSON - 7.5 . Worked tirelessly in front of his defence to ensure that Liverpool did not have the time and space to pick off their Championship opponents. Lee Williamson (right) worked tirelessly against the Reds' star-studded attack, including Philippe Coutinho . CORRY EVANS - 6.5 . Hasn’t been the best weekend for the Evans family, but he’ll be more than satisfied with a solid performance here . CRAIG CONWAY - 6 . Had Blackburn’s best chance of the first half but blazed high and wide with only Mignolet to beat from just inside the box. TOM CAIRNEY - 6.5 . Impressed in a central role behind Gestede, particularly in the first half when Blackburn were more not pinned back in their own half. Booked for high challenge on Balotelli. Blackburn's Tom Cairney (right) impressed for his side in behind Gestede . BEN MARSHALL - 6 . Replaced by Taylor midway through the second half after putting in a decent shift on the left side of Blackburn’s midfield . RUDY GESTEDE - 8 . Posed a real problem for the Liverpool defence from the moment Skrtel was injured. Won almost every high ball and provided a vital outlet for his team. Blackburn's Rudy Gestede endures close attention from Emre Can as the Rovers held the Reds to 0-0 . Subs: Spurr, Brown, Rhodes, Taylor (for Marshall 68, 6), Henry, Lenihan, Steele. Booked: Cairney .

"It was the day before Everton's return to Europe and Phil Jagielka was holding court in the media auditorium at Finch Farm. A naturally bubbly character, Jagielka was in high spirits as he focused on the imminent clash with Wolfsburg but it was only a matter of time before he knew the topic of conversation would change. He would have to confront a difficult summer and testing start to the new campaign. 'A little bit sticky,' was how he chose to describe the last four months. It was, perhaps, an understatement. Having been in the firing line for England's World Cup demise and scrutinised for the poor goals Everton had been conceding, lesser souls might have found it all too much. Phil Jagielka is not one to shy away from pressure, and has faced a difficult period admirably . Everton captain Jagielka was impressive against Liverpool in the Merseyside derby on Saturday . Jagielka scored a stunning goal from 25 yards to rescue a late point for his Everton side . Jagielka, though, is not someone who will ever hide. He is a character who will face up to issue and however hard he found the questions, he answered them impressively. He fights and doesn't give in. That is why, in the 91st minute of the 223rd Merseyside derby, he was scuffling around the edge of Liverpool's penalty area, trying to find a way of helping his team salvage something from a game that was slipping away. How Everton's captain delivered. Latching on to a headed clearance from Dejan Lovren, Jagielka crashed volley from 25 yards into the top corner of The Kop net, to leave Anfield – bar one delirious Blue corner – in stunned silence. It was, undoubtedly, the most spectacular goal scored by an Everton player behind enemy lines since Graeme Sharp's howitzer in 1984. Simon Mignolet (left) is powerless to stop Jagielka's howitzer at Anfield on Saturday lunchtime . Everton players celebrate Jagielka's equalising goal, which rescued a point for the Toffees late on . Seasons, both individually and collectively, can be transformed in such dramatic moments and so high was the quality of the goal, Roberto Martinez labelled it the best he had seen at a live game. 'We pushed up a little bit and there was an opportunity about five minutes before when I elected to pass and I thought if one comes across again I'll swing one at it and thankfully the swinging worked,' Jagielka said modestly. 'It's been a frustrating season so far and to go one-nil down and to keep knocking at the door the way we did shows tremendous character. A point is decent, we'd have loved three. But we've got to make sure we keep the character strong because right now we're not picking up the right results.' Jagielka's performance, in front of England manager Roy Hodgson, may go some way to restoring his international place . Jagielka (right) admits he is no longer a starter in the England team, but his performance yesterday will have impressed Hodgson, sat observing in the Director's Box . Everton did not play well yesterday but, at the back, the combination of Jagielka and John Stones was solid and their respective performances would have been noted by England head coach Roy Hodgson, who was sat observing in the Directors' Box. Jagielka accepts he is no longer a first choice for England, given he was dropped for the recent games against Norway and Switzerland, but if he keeps playing in this manner, both club and country will feel the benefit. This has to be a catalyst for revival. 'We've performed ok but the results haven't shown it,' said Jagielka. 'So it's about the lads to come out and keep playing the way we are and keep having the courage to do the right things and hopefully they'll turn around.' He is proof of that. Jagielka (centre) heads for the degout as he celebrates with team-mates at Anfield .","Phil Jagielka has been in the firing line for both Everton's poor start to the season and England's World Cup demise .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Passport: American-born Randall Cole, 44, says he had to answer 'clearly homophobic' questions when he attended a routine interview to get a British passport . A passport official has been suspended pending a disciplinary investigation after a gay man complained he was interrogated about his personal life in front of his four-year-old son during a routine passport interview. Randall Cole, 44, says he was grilled for half an hour by a Home Office employee in Chelmsford, Essex, about whether he had ever had sex with a woman, why his son's biological mother had given him up, and what passers-by thought when they walked past him and his husband with their two adopted sons. The American-born charity worker, who is married to a Brit and became a British citizen in May, said that when he objected to her questioning in front of his small child, the woman said: 'We can ask anything we want'. Mr Cole has filed a formal complaint to the Home Office, and the employee is currently suspended while an investigation is held into the matter. He said he was shaking after the interview, which was conducted in the middle of an open-plan office and left him feeling violated. The father of two adopted sons said that the atmosphere in the 'clearly homophobic' interview changed when he explained that he had two adopted children with his husband, Stuart Wales, 42, and the passport official realised he was gay. Despite him being accompanied by his son Samuel, four, Mr Cole said he was asked whether the children were biologically theirs, what Samuel and his brother Benjamin, eight, thought of their birth mother, and whether they were confused by their family set-up. Mr Cole said that he explained that even if the boys' birth mother were there too, if one of them fell over, he would run to him rather than her, but says the Home Office employee merely sighed and shook her head. He told the Guardian: 'Then she said: ""What do you think people make of you when they see you walking down the street with your kids?""' And he said she went on to quiz him about whether the boys called their biological mother 'Mum', forcing him to explain to his small boy about him coming out of his mother's 'tummy' but him and his husband being their parents.  Mr Cole said the line of questioning in front of his son left him upset that he had 'failed to keep him safe'. He said that when he said he worked part-time, the woman dismissed him as playing the 'housewife' role in the couple, and then her questioning became even more personal. 'She said: ""You must have had relationships with women in the past, though?""'  He said at this point he objected, but she was having none of it. 'She became indignant and said: ""We can ask anything we want, regardless of whether or not it makes you feel uncomfortable,""' he said. Chelmsford: Mr Cole has submitted a written complaint to the Home Office after his interview in the Essex town . Mr Cole, who married human resources manager Mr Wales in California but moved to Britain because of its reputation for tolerance, said the woman was clearly trying to humiliate him and put him in his place.

Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell told MailOnline: 'It's truly shocking in this day and age that a Home Office official can behave in this intrusive and bigoted way. 'I'm delighted that the official has been suspended.  No-one applying for a passport should be subjected to such humiliation for any reason.

"China's stated budget for this year was $120bn (Â£70bn), but the US report said the actual figure was closer to $145bn.
The US called on China to be more open about its plans, amid high tension with other regional powers over disputed islands in the South China Sea.
China often accused the US of hypocrisy as their budget dwarfs Beijing's.
The American military budget was about $600bn in 2013.
The annual US report on China's defences usually gives a rough estimate of spending, with last year's quoting a figure of between $135bn and $215bn.
But officials say this year they have a much better understanding of the way China operates.
The Pentagon said Beijing was spending money on upgrading its arsenal of drones, warships, jets, missiles and cyber weapons.
Beijing's main focus, it said, was still on a potential confrontation in the Taiwan Strait.
But it was also increasingly focusing on the territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas.
China claims islands and rocky outcrops throughout the seas that are also claimed by countries including the Philippines, Vietnam and Japan.
The US said China's lack of openness caused serious concern for other nations in the region.
""Absent greater transparency from China and a change in its behaviour, these concerns will likely intensify as [Chinese] military modernisation programme progresses,"" the report said.
Beijing has not so far responded to the criticism.","China has under-reported its 2014 defence spending by about 20%, according to an annual report put out by the US defence department."
"Cryptoy was created by three industrial placement students and tells the story of four historical cyphers, including the German Enigma code, cracked at Bletchley Park during World War Two.
The free app for Android tablet devices also encrypts messages using the codes.
GCHQ says it is hoping it will help to encourage teenagers to be the next generation of cyber security experts.
Cryptoy also showcases the substitution and vigenere cyphers, and the shift, which dates back to Roman times.
A spokeswoman for Cheltenham-based GCHQ said the app is intended as a ""fun teaching aid"" to help 14-16 year olds studying at the Key Stage 4 level learn something about code making and code breaking.
She said it aims to encourage them to become interested in associated disciplines such as mathematics, as well as problem solving and the necessary programming skills to create such an app.
""All of this is extremely relevant to today's world where information security is increasingly important and where we need young people to study the subjects necessary,"" she added.
The app was initially produced by the industrial placement students for the Cheltenham Festival cultural event last year.
The GCHQ spokeswoman said the agency was keen where possible to be open about some aspects of its work.
The BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones said the public should have no qualms about downloading the app.
Cryptoy will be available to download directly from Google Play or through the GCHQ website. It is understood that a version for Apple iPads will not be available until next year.",The government's electronic monitoring agency GCHQ is releasing its first computer app.
"The Glasgow-based company, which makes valves and pumps for the energy and mining industries, said oil and gas orders fell 23% in the first quarter.
Weir expects the decline to continue in the second quarter.
It plans to cut 125 jobs, mostly in its North American oil and gas business.
It will also consolidate its service centres in the region in a bid to deliver cost savings of ??10m.
In a trading statement, Weir said oil and gas markets had been hit by much lower oil prices, which had led to significant reductions in activity levels.
There was better news from the company's minerals division, which saw orders rise year-on-year by 5% between January and April, in line with expectations.
However, Weir warned that mining end markets continued to be challenging, with iron ore prices falling further in the first quarter.
Chief executive Keith Cochrane said: ""While mining markets remained subdued, the performance of the minerals division once again demonstrated its resilience.
""Trading conditions in oil and gas markets were challenging through the quarter with a steeper decline in the North American rig count than the market had anticipated.
""Oil and gas activity levels are still falling and we expect a further decline in divisional revenues in the second quarter.

"My time covering transport at BBC London has nearly mirrored his in office - and so as he departs I thought it timely to put down some non-definitive thoughts.
Recently I asked Mr Johnson if he enjoyed dealing with the transport - his answer was quick: ""Of course, it's the best bit.""
But it has not been without its ups and downs and controversy. And while there have been flamboyant quotes - remember the ""grit-snow lasagne"" - what has changed?
Over the last eight years, even his most fierce critics would acknowledge there has been huge investment in transport.
Crossrail is due to open, the Tube upgrades have continued and the underground service seems better although overcrowding continues to be a problem.
While the mayor seems reluctant to highlight Tube reliability as an achievement, according to Transport for London (TfL) figures, it has improved.
There have been many bumps - for example the Jubilee line upgrade - which initially hit problems as the PPP contractor Tube Lines struggled, and weekend closures were extremely unpopular.
The solution - something else not mentioned very much - was to kill off the PPP by buying the shares of Bechtel and Amey (Ferrovial) from Tube Lines for Â£310m. In effect it brought the upgrade back in house.
There have also been run-ins with the unions as huge changes were implemented on the Tube.
Mr Johnson changed tack on ticket office closures which he initially opposed.
He also tried to get through a Night Tube - as yet there isn't an official start date. And he never sat down with the transport unions, preferring TfL bosses to do the talking.
Elsewhere, the Overground has been a big success story as has the rise of contactless payments for example.
Of course, TfL has only been able to do these projects as it based its business plan on increasing fares at inflation +1%. So this all came at a price for commuters, who were paying for future investment - today - with higher fares.
While sometimes you got the feeling some projects would probably have happened anyway - the mayor's mission was selling the point that higher fares were needed for higher investment.
Although towards the end of his eight years, it felt like fares were as high as they could go. And don't forget he relied on central government cash to increase them just in line with inflation.
And there is the question if Mr Johnson was hard enough in driving through efficiencies at TfL. Could there have been more savings?
If there is a Boris Johnson legacy, then cycling infrastructure is probably it. Segregated cycle superhighways are now opening and there is political consensus to continue building them.
The mayoral candidates do not want to be seen to be undoing the work done.
In that sense, his legacy is as political as it is physical.
But it was not a straight-forward route. In the first term of Mr Johnson backed un-segregated ""blue paint"" bike lanes which no-one really liked.
Cycle Superhighway 2 encouraged cyclists onto a dangerous junction at Bow roundabout.
It encouraged cyclists but gave them no protection. The cycling lobby, The Times paper and many cycling bloggers demanded more.
The turning point came in the mayoral election of 2012, when Mr Johnson changed his policy to segregated bike tracks and promised a cycling commissioner to drive them through.
A horrendous number of deaths in 2013 also increased pressure on the mayor to act. He deployed traffic police onto the most dangerous junctions.
Today, segregated bike tracks are opening.
And the cycle hire scheme, which was meant to be at ""no cost to the taxpayer"", will according to the London Assembly have cost Â£225m by 2016.
And the construction of the cycle tracks have added to one of the big problems facing the next mayor - congestion.
Mr Johnson called it ""operation juddering climax"". And there's no doubt congestion has got worse - something the next mayor will need to tackle.
Again he switched policy from ""smoothing traffic flow"" of the first term and dismantling the Western Extension of the Congestion Charging Zone, to giving over road space to cyclists.
Eventually that created a ""bikelash"" even though City Hall tried to point out congestion was being created by an increase in white vans, construction and the huge increase in private hire cars due to apps like Uber.
While air quality has gone up the political agenda, it is still a huge problem with thousands of Londoners dying each year prematurely due to bad air.
London experimented with ""dust suppressants"" and ""green walls"" but while City Hall says they are tackling pollution levels, they still breach EU limits.
Clean air campaigners say that Boris Johnson has failed to get a grip on this problem and his plans for an ultra-low emission zone are too far off.
I have lost count of the number of outlandish ideas that have been mooted and then withered.
Odd schemes like the tunnel under Hyde Park or a bike track on the side of rail tracks.
Then you'd hear an idea like a cable car over the Thames - and they would actually deliver it.
It is the most expensive urban cable car in the world and don't forget it's built with some regeneration money from the EU and TfL cash - but at the moment it is essentially a tourist attraction.
One day it might be a regeneration tool but the number of commuters using it is tiny.
Could you lump in the New Routemasters in as an expensive vanity project?
Certainly the mayor's opponents never liked them and thought it would be better to buy hybrids off the shelf.
Overseas sales never materialised and they have had all kinds of problems with hybrid engines and non-opening windows.
But when you speak to some Londoners there is a kind of begrudging affection for them and it was the use of the Routemaster as a political tool during the 2008 election that got Mr Johnson elected.
And so they will always probably polarise opinion.
If there's one project that is the mayor's pet it is the Thames Estuary Airport. If there is such a thing as small talk with a mayor - this is the area it will usually veer into.
And it was his pet project from very early on in his first term.
He took journalists out into the estuary to look at potential sites. He lobbied the Airports Commission, and then attacked it when it rejected his idea.
It has been derided as a folly - but it is probably the one transport project that is now wedded to his future career.
This has been eight years of huge investment in London transport. I have lost count of the number of new infrastructure projects and tunnels I have seen funded in part through higher fares.
There have been policy changes and switches in focus.
And a mix of the pragmatic steady hand on the tiller and the more outlandish.
But ultimately it will be commuters who'll judge Boris Johnson's eight years in charge of London's transport.",Is it really eight years ago that Boris Johnson first became London's mayor?

A football referee made history last night by becoming the first woman to officiate an NFL game. Shannon Eastin served as the line judge for the San Diego Chargers' 21-13 preseason victory over the Green Bay Packers, making her the first female referee in the NFL's 97-year history. All went well on the night for Eastin, who was only selected because an ongoing dispute with regular referees meant the NFL had to draft in replacements. Wearing Number 27 on the back of her black-and-white striped uniform and with her hair tucked under her cap, Eastin seemed dwarfed by the players, but remained calm as she made history within the San Diego stadium. Run to it: Shannon Eastin takes her place on the field during an NFL preseason football game between the San Diego Chargers and the Green Bay Packers . The 42-year-old, who is from Arizona, also seemed to get the thumbs up from the coaches for her performance on the night. 'She was confident and in control,' said Chargers coach Norv Turner. Packers coach Mike McCarthy added: 'I thought she did a good job of . communicating. I was focused on the . Packers, but there was communication before the game.' Though she wasn't involved in many calls until late, Eastin appeared to stay steady among the giants and worked well alongside her seven-man crew. The trailblazer got her shot at making history as a replacement official following a dispute between the NFL and the regular referees, who are now locked out. The disagreement marks the first time in 11 years that the NFL has had to draft in replacements, who are scheduled to work 16 games over the weekend. Hearing of the decision to use Eastin for last night's game, the locked out NFL Referees Association said that she should be barred, because she once took part in a World Series of Poker tournament.

A multiple national judo champion as a child, Eastin also  owns a company called SE Sports Officiating, which trains officials in football and basketball. Just before the game, Eastin seemed to fit right in and appeared relax as she chatted with the other officials, members of the chain crew and players. Chargers tackle Jeromey Clary and . linebacker Antwan Barnes sought her out, shaking her . hand and saying a few words before she ran down the sideline for the . first time.

A former anorexic claims that she owes her life to her gym for banning her when her fitness obsession saw her shrink to a tiny five stone. Caitlin Millar, 21, became addicted to the gym and skipping meals after she began to feel that she was unable to control anything else in her life. While her exercise regime seemed healthy, Ms Miller was losing weight rapidly because she was consuming far fewer calories than her body needed. Caitlin Millar (left), 21, says that she owes her life to her gym for banning her when she became dangerously thin (right). In a year she dropped from weighing 8st 7lbs to weighing just 5st . It was only once she was banned from her gym that she realised how painfully thin she had become. Now, she is finally on the road to recovery - and has been able to start living like any other student at a healthy 8st 9lbs. Ms Millar, from Berkshire, said: ‘I was obsessed with being the best in everything I did whether it was in sports events or school, I had to be the most successful or I wasn’t happy. ‘When I started puberty I couldn’t deal with all the changes happening to my body that I couldn’t control. ‘I had always competed in running and when younger talent started emerging and I wasn’t the best anymore I couldn’t handle it. ‘My weight was something I could control completely and so I started skipping meals and working out more knowing that if I kept control of this then I might regain control of everything else in my life. Ms Millar, who now weighs a healthy 8st 9lbs, says that she started to skip meals and over-exercise when she began to feel that she was losing control of her life . Ms Millar (pictured since her recovery) said: 'My weight was something I could control so I started skipping meals and working out more knowing that if I kept control of this then I might regain control of everything else' ‘When I started at university I became even worse because there was no one there to realise what I was doing or to make sure I didn’t skip meals.’ Ms Millar first began to obsess about her weight when, aged 15, training started to become more of a chore than a hobby and she could feel herself losing grasp of the perfect life she had crafted for herself. Despite being a slim size eight, she felt this was not the best she could be and started skipping meals and heading to the gym as much as she possibly could. Ms Millar (pictured when she was ill) says that her weight loss increased when she started university as there was no one there to ensure that she was not skipping meals . Ms Millar (pictured, left, when she was ill and, right, since she has recovered) says that her health problems began when she struggled to cope with the fact that she was no longer the best runner in competitions . She said: ‘Knowing that there were younger people coming into competing who were better than me was hard. ‘I wanted to regain control of something and so I started to cut meals out and added in more and more gym workouts.’ Aged 18, Ms Millar was a healthy size eight and weighed about eight-and-a-half stone – healthy for her 5ft 6ins frame. But within a year, she had lost more than a third of her body weight, dropping to five stone. Ms Millar (pictured taking part in an athletics competition) said: 'Knowing that there were younger people coming into competing who were better than me was hard' Despite her friends and family mentioning their worries, she was determined to keep losing weight and keep control of that part of her life. Ms Millar said: ‘I had been ill for about two years when one day I was pulled into the office at the gym at university by one of the staff. ‘He sat me down and said that he was going to have to ban me from the gym as people had been commenting on how worried they were about my weight. Ms Millar said: 'I had been ill for about two years when one day I was pulled into the office at the gym at university by one of the staff. He sat me down and said that he was going to have to ban me from the gym' ‘I was furious to know that people had been talking about me behind my back but shocked that they were worried enough to make a comment. ‘I walked away from the gym feeling so embarrassed that I knew something had to change then and there. ‘I trawled the internet for somewhere that could help me and came across the Anorexia Nervosa Intensive Treatment Team. ‘They tailor-made a less terrifying diet plan based on my current food and exercise regimes which gradually built up over time.’ Ms Millar says that being banned from the gym came as a shock to her because she had not realised that she was so thin. As soon as this happened, she started to look for help . Ms Millar has now returned to full health and is able to enjoy university weighing a healthy 8st 9lbs. Her mother said: 'I am so proud that she managed to battle the illness and come out of the other side' Ms Millar’s mother, Alison, said: ‘When Caitlin started becoming obsessed with her weight we knew that this was a battle that she had to face. ‘The more we tried to stop her from doing it the more we pushed her into doing it more. ‘We just had to hope that she got things under control herself. ‘Watching her so poorly was awful but all I could do was support her and try to look after her as much as I could. ‘I’m so happy she is better now though and back to her normal self. ‘I am so proud that she managed to battle the illness and come out of the other side a much better and happier person.’","Caitlin Millar dropped from 8st 7lbs to 5st in a year by skipping meals .

"(CNN) At one of Nevada's infamous legal brothels, a 20-year-old woman recently signed up for work -- but not to have sex. 
  
 Instead, Katherine Stone, who dreams of one day becoming a lawyer, planned to sell something other women working at the bordello couldn't offer: Her virginity. 
  
 Like the brothels themselves, Stone's choice has been controversial, particularly for those who believe a woman's virginity should only be shared for love. 
  
 But in Stone's eyes, that's exactly what she's doing. 
  
 'I love my family' 
  
 In 2014, Stone's family home in Seattle, Washington, was destroyed by a fire. Without insurance, Stone and her family found themselves forced to remain in the scorched property. 
  
 Then came the day when she noticed an ad on Facebook, and ""I found out all about the brothels and the money,"" Stone says. ""It made me think, 'Wow, it's a chance at fixing all that I need to fix.'"" 
  
 JUST WATCHED Legal brothel owner: I don't have to recruit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Legal brothel owner: I don't have to recruit 01:29 
  
 While prostitution is practiced across the United States, Nevada is the only state where it's a legal activity. Any Nevada county with a population below 700,000 can host a brothel and, as of 2015, there were 19 brothels operating in the state. 
  
 Brothel tycoon Dennis Hof owns seven of Nevada's legal bordellos, and that's who Stone turned to last year for help. 
  
 Hof -- who says he receives two to three similar requests a week -- agreed to sell Stone's one-time service with the understanding that he'll take a 50% cut from the profits of the final bid. 
  
 In an effort to salvage her family's damaged home, Stone packed her bags and left home for the first time to live at one of Hof's brothels. 
  
 ""People say you are suppose to do it for love,"" Stone says of the cultural ideals around losing one's virginity. ""But if you think about it, I am doing it because I love my family."" 
  
 'I obviously value myself' 
  
 Like the brothels themselves, Stone's decision has been controversial. ""I read an article about myself online that made me cry,"" Stone recalls. ""It was a Christian lady; she said I had no self-respect, which I disagree with completely. I mean, I obviously value myself."" 
  
 At the moment, Stone says, her virginity bid is a little over $400,000 -- and she's still waiting to accept an offer. 
  
 ""I'm waiting for a man who I feel a connection with so that the experience can be special for both of us,"" she says. ""It's really not just about the money."" 
  
 While she waits, Stone is still ""contracted by Dennis Hof to legally provide services to gentlemen who are seeking experiences"" other than intercourse, she says. ""I have done small simple parties. Massage parties, stuff that has been very PG-13. My first experience I had here was the scariest one. It was all really new.""

 Even after her virginity is auctioned, Stone says she has no intentions of leaving the ranch. ""I anticipate to continue working at the ranch for the next five years,"" she says. ""I plan to go to law school in the future."" 
  
 'I have the right to choose' 
  
 Hof himself has been heavily criticized, with some lambasting him for exploiting women in need. The businessman and reality TV personality employs over 500 women at his ranches in Nevada, with roughly 30 working every weeknight at the famous Moonlite Bunny Ranch. 
  
 As for Stone's contract, ""it's controversial; there is not any question about that,"" Hof says. But, he continues, ""It is her choice. I don't think it is a good idea for a girl to drink six tequilas and lose her virginity on the bathroom floor in a frat house ... If she wants to (sell) it, I think that's great."" 
  
 If that sounds like something a pimp would say, Hof wouldn't disagree. ""In the strictest sense, I am a pimp,"" he says. ""I am a guy that brings customers to a girl. The difference is I have a license to do this."" 
  
 Stone would argue she has the same. 
  
 ""I have the right to choose what I do with my body,"" she says. ""And in this troubling economy, do you blame me?"" ||||| After a devastating fire claimed her home, a young Washington woman has made an important decision many have viewed as extremely controversial. 
  
 20-year-old Katherine Stone has decided to auction off her virginity for the sake of her family. 
  
 Stone’s family home in Seattle was destroyed in a fire in 2014. They had no insurance so due to financial complications, they were forced to stay on the burned out property. 
  
 Later, Stone came across a Facebook ad for a legal brothel in Nevada. Prostitution is legal in some counties in the state. 
  
 Stone turned to Dennis Hof, who owns at least seven brothels in Nevada, each one of them legal. 
  
 “I talked to my people and I talked to her and she convinced me that this is something she wanted to do,” Hof told InsideEdition.com. 
  
 With support from her mother, Stone said goodbye to her old home and made her way to one of Hof’s brothels, where she now lives. 
  
 “I was definitely scared throughout the whole thing,” Stone told InsideEdition.com. “I was intimidated because I was brand new to the sex industry.” 
  
 Despite her fears, she said all of the ladies who work at Hof’s brothel are supportive. 
  
 “It’s just a good environment; we have fun here,” she said. 
  
 The current bid for Stone's virginity has reached $400,000, but no offers have been accepted just yet. 
  
 According to Hof, she is looking for Mr. Right. 
  
 “She hasn’t found the right situation,” said Hof. “She’s had guys that she’s liked that didn’t have enough money and she’s had guys that had enough but she didn’t like them.” 
  
 Hof said due to Stone’s situation, he won't accept any of the profits. 
  
 Stone said she’s waiting for someone to make her feel comfortable with what she’s doing and, while there have been negative criticisms online, Stone won't let it affect her. 
  
 “The whole time I’ve been here, I’ve come to terms with what I’m doing,” she said. “I’m definitely ready.""

Gentle reader, meet 20-year-old Katherine Stone of Washington state, who says she would like to lose hers so that she might rebuild her family's home, which burned down uninsured in 2014. And given that family homes aren't cheap, Stone is now selling her virginity to the highest-yet-still-at-least-not-totally-terrible bidder; bids are currently north of $400,000. ""People say you are supposed to do it for love,"" Stone tells CNN. ""But if you think about it, I am doing it because I love my family."" To do it, Stone, who says she wants to be a lawyer, enlisted the help of brothel impresario Dennis Hof, who runs seven perfectly legal establishments of ill repute in Nevada. Hof, while acknowledging that helping Stone find a paying suitor is ""controversial,"" adds that ""it is her choice. I don't think it is a good idea for a girl to drink six tequilas and lose her virginity on the bathroom floor in a frat house. ... If she wants to (sell) it, I think that's great.""

""I'm waiting for a man who I feel a connection with so that the experience can be special for both of us,"" she says. ""It's really not just about the money."" It's unclear whether Hof is taking a cut of Stone's proceeds. But, he tells KSAT, ""she hasn’t found the right situation. She’s had guys that she’s liked that didn’t have enough money and she’s had guys that had enough but she didn’t like them.""

"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 3:18 PM on 20th December 2011 . A social work professor accused of rape and performing other lewd acts on teenage girls has been formally charged. Dwain Pellebon, 54, of the University of Oklahoma, was arraigned on two counts of rape, two counts of lewd acts with a child and two counts of sexual child abuse. The professor was arrested last week after authorities received allegations from a child welfare worker he had sexually abused two teenage girls in the past two years. He denies all the allegations. Paid leave: Dwain Pellebon, 54, of the University of Oklahoma, has been arrested for allegedly committing rape twice and lewd acts on a child under 16 years old . A state Department of Human Services worker told Norman police that a . 13-year-old reported seeing Pellebon fondle another 13-year-old during a . sleepover at the suspect's Norman home, according to a search warrant . affidavit. The girl was interviewed by police . last week, according to NewsOk, and told them she woke up in his home on . at least two occasions with Pellebon lying beside her touching her . 'from her hair to her ankles'. The alleged abuse started when she was 11. The social worker also said Pellebon sexually abused a mentally disabled 15-year-old at least twice. The girl also told police the suspect would remove her from bed, take her clothes off and 'display her on a bed for viewing'. Court documents also revealed the . girl said Pellebon kept track of her menstrual cycle and showed her . 'parts of the body you weren't supposed to see'. The social work professor admitted . taking off the girl's clothes but said he did it to apply cream to her . 'chest, back and butt' while they were alone in his bedroom. NewsOk reported that though Pellebon denies any sexual contact, he described himself to investigators as an 'affectionate, sensual man who liked to hug, kiss, cuddle and stroke young girls that he felt close to'. He also told police that he had viewed child pornography once but did not download it. University: Pellebon is on unpaid leave from the university and free on $75,000 bail . In 2001, Pellebon was investigated by DHS under similar circumstances . but no charges were filed because the alleged victim — the daughter of a . former Norman police officer — failed to give investigators a . statement, documents show. He has been placed on administrative leave without pay and is free on $75,000 bail. The 54-year-old was a director on a local board for Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA), which helps children in juvenile court and foster systems. He took a leave of absence from the board earlier this year, a Cleveland County CASA spokesman told The Oklahoman. Pellebon . teaches a course on human sexuality that looks at ‘sexual behaviour, . gender differences and sexual values’, reported CNN. After he was arrested a university spokesman said they 'acted swiftly to suspend Pellebon from any contact with students and from use of any university facilities'.","Dwain Pellebon, 54, arrested for rape and lewd acts .

"The research from the LSE and the universities of Manchester and York examines the coalition's tax and spending record.
It says poverty will get worse over the next five years.
In response the government said the richest have ""lost the most"" from changes to taxes and welfare.
John Hills, director of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Exclusion at London School of Economics and one of the lead authors of the report said despite coalition promises that the greatest burden of the cuts would fall on those who had more, and that the poor would be protected, that had not happened.
""While people at the bottom were initially protected with the way benefits were adjusted for inflation, that has not been the case for the last two years,"" he said.
The report says tax and benefit reforms have hit families with children under five harder than any other household type.
Policies affecting families with young children include the abolition of baby tax credit which increased the payments for households with a child under one and extra support for pregnant women.
Further changes have affected families on limited incomes, including the £26,000 cap on total benefits a household can receive and shifting tax credit thresholds.
As well as changes to taxes and benefits, the report also highlights cuts to government spending affecting young children.
Real spending per child on early education and childcare and Sure Start services fell by a quarter between 2009-10 and 2012-13 it says.
""That it's families that are taking the biggest hit is really disappointing and short-sighted, said Kitty Stewart, author of the part of the report examining the impact on under fives.
""We know that family income and services are important to children's development. All the research evidence tells us both of those matter and both of those have been hit.""
She estimates some families may have lost out on around £1200 in their baby's first year.
A Treasury spokesperson said: ""the richest have lost the most from the government's changes to taxes and welfare.""
It said the LSE's research also failed to take into account ""the effects of changes to the vital public services on which so many rely. That means that it can't consider the full range of ways the government provides support to the poorest and most vulnerable families across the country"".
The Treasury pointed to the freezing of fuel duty and council tax, the provision of free school meals and tax-free childcare, and the increase in the tax-free personal allowance as measures that would help many people, including lower income groups and families.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies reported last week that coalition changes to tax and benefits have cost the average UK household £489 a year with low-income working-age households hit hardest.
The IFS said the poorest tenth of households lost around 4% of their incomes.
John Hill from the LSE said it was true that the very rich, with incomes over £100,000 had lost out more than the average, but that when viewed as  a proportion of their income, it was the poorest who had lost out most.
He said strategic decisions on the part of the government to ring-fence the NHS and schools had meant even larger cuts for other areas of spending.","Families with young children and poorer households have been worst affected by government changes to tax and benefits, according to a new report."
"Federal MP Clive Palmer has revealed his wife will run as a candidate in his party but insists she'll be judged on her own merits. Anna Palmer is one of three candidates vying for preselection in the Gold Coast seat of Gaven at next year's Queensland election.

'We've got two other candidates who are pretty good - she may be selected or she may not be.' But Mr Palmer could not immediately say who the other contenders were. He said he wouldn't have discussions with the other two candidates, because 'it would be a conflict of interest, as you could appreciate'.

'She's entitled to do what she wants to,' he said.

'Everyone that's a member of my family, who works for our company or is a member of the party is entitled individually to stand for what they want to,' he said.

He said he was yet to decide whether PUP would run a candidate in Yeerongpilly against now-independent Carl Judge, who also quit the PUP earlier this month, leaving the party without a presence in state parliament.

"(CNN) -- Robert Kubica's Lotus-Renault team said Monday that the F1 star was ""much better"" after undergoing emergency surgery in an Italian hospital following his crash while competing in a motor rally. The 26-year-old Pole spent the night in an induced coma after a seven-hour operation to repair multiple fractures to his right arm and hand. Kubica required several transfusions during the procedure to stabilize his condition after losing a lot of blood following the high-speed accident. But in a statement on the team's official website, they said that Kubica had been briefly woken by doctors at the Santa Corona hospital in Pietra Ligure and was able to talk to his relatives. ""He was also able to move his fingers, which is an encouraging sign for the rest of the recovery process,"" it said. Dr. Mario Igor Rosello, the specialist who operated on Kubica, claimed the lack of swelling or infection on his right forearm was also a ""good sign"" but added it will be ""several days before it is known if the operation is 100 per cent successful."" Kubica badly hurt in rallying crash . Kubica suffered multiple fractures to his right arm and leg after hitting a guard rail when he lost control of his Skoda Fabia during the Ronde de Andorra rally in Italy. With the first race of the new Formula One season in Bahrain next month, his Lotus Renault team defended Kubica's decision to take part in a rally so close to the start of the season. ""He loves rallying,"" team boss Eric Boullier told Italian news agency Ansa. ""We knew the risks and so did he. We didn't want a robot or a corporate man for a driver. It was agreed."" Kubica finished 2010 in eighth position and was due to start his fifth campaign as a first-choice driver, but there are now doubts as to whether the former Sauber driver will be fit to play any part in the 2011 campaign. When asked about the length of time it could take for 2008 Canadian Grand Prix winner to recover, Rossello is reported by the BBC to have said, ""One year. One year is the best provision."" Kubica also suffered fractures to his shoulder and elbow and Lotus Renault said the hospital would decide over the next few days if further operations were necessary on these injuries. Support has been offered from throughout the close-knit world of F1 for the only Polish driver to have ever driven at this level, including a specially-designed ""Twibbon"" on the social-networking site Twitter. McLaren's 2009 world champion Jenson Button tweeted, ""Shocking news about Robert Kubica. I wish him a speedy recovery."" Another driver to offer his sympathies was Williams' veteran Brazilian Rubens Barrichello, who used his Twitter blog to say, ""I would like to ask you for your best wishes to Kubica,"" and ""we all like him and he deserves all the best."" If Kubica is unable to take to the grid for the start of the season, Lotus Renault may choose to promote one of their two reserve drivers. The team's two options are Bruno Senna, who raced for HRT in 2010, and Frenchman Romain Grosjean.

"Washington (CNN)Legislation to approve the Keystone XL pipeline is headed back to Congress after President Barack Obama vetoed the bill Tuesday. Obama's veto of the bill comes after a yearslong debate on the controversial pipeline which ultimately handed a legislative victory to proponents of the pipeline after Republicans took control of the Senate in January. The House and Senate may have come together to send a single piece of legislation to Obama, but don't expect that agreement to lead to construction permits for the pipeline project that would ship crude oil from Canada to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. Republicans may have enough Democratic support to clear a filibuster, but they'll be hard-pressed to find the 67 votes to override a veto. So what's the big fuss? Why is this one pipeline such a contentious issue and is it really worth the fight for opponents and advocates of Keystone XL? Let's break it down: . How long would the Keystone XL pipeline be? TransCanada's full-fledged Keystone Pipeline system is waiting for U.S. approval to finish construction on 1,200 miles of pipeline known as Keystone XL -- the final piece of a 3,800-mile pipeline network. Wait. There's already a Keystone pipeline? That's right. Keystone XL represents just under a third of the entire Keystone project, and every other piece of pipe has been built and laid out. In fact, TransCanada's pipeline system is already shipping hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude oil from the Canadian oil sands across the U.S. border -- and into Illinois. The current Keystone XL proposal would run the pipeline through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas . Oil sands ... that sounds familiar. That's because oil sands are one of environmentalists' biggest gripes over the proposed Keystone XL pipeline since extracting crude oil from the oil sands (oil + sand = oil sands) pumps about 17% more greenhouse gases into the air than standard crude oil extraction, according to a State Department review of the project. And either way, the State Department concluded the oil sands will be developed regardless of whether the pipeline goes through. But that's not all that's prompted environmentalists to protest Keystone XL and deploy an inflatable pipeline on Sen. Mary Landrieu's front yard last November when she was leading the charge to pass the bill. Environmentalists, local residents and indigenous tribes are also protesting the pipeline's planned route, which would cut across the Ogallala Aquifer, which is one of the world's largest. Aqui-what? Aquifer is just a fancy term for an underground layer of porous rock trapping large deposits of water that can often be accessed through wells -- there are about 2,500 within a mile of the would-be Keystone XL route. Aquifers are a key source of fresh water, and environmentalists are concerned the pipeline could pollute those reserves. But the State Department concluded in January -- amid continued objections from environmentalists -- that the impact on water quality ""would be limited."" You said indigenous tribes were also protesting the project? Yes. Native Americans are concerned about the societal impact of camps with thousands of construction workers living near their communities, which face a high rate of sexual assaults from non-indigenous men, representatives of the activist Wica Agli group said in an interview earlier this week. Angus King a 'no' on Keystone XL vote . And the pipeline would also run through the sovereign lands of some tribes. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe even declared that the House bill to approve Keystone XL last week amounted to a declaration of war. War? Sounds serious. If it comes to that, will the economic benefits be worth it at least? Depends what you consider to be ""worth it."" The State Department concluded in January the project would create about 42,000 jobs directly and indirectly during the construction phase (indirect: think commercial benefits for restaurants, shops, etc.). That total includes 3,900 construction jobs to actually build the pipeline. Fact checking Keystone jobs claims . All in all, the pipeline would inject $2 billion in total economic benefits, according to the State Department review. But once the construction -- which would last no more than two years -- wraps up, Keystone XL will have created just 50 permanent jobs -- the number needed to maintain the pipeline. Either way, the State Department's conclusions seriously undercut TransCanada's claims in 2011 that the project would create about 140,000 direct and indirect jobs. So if this pipeline goes through, what are the risks of an oil spill? Not too high. The State Department concluded the Keystone XL proposal ""would include processes, procedures, and systems to prevent, detect, and mitigate potential oil spills."" And will the pipeline help lower gas prices in the U.S.? Not really. The State Department said Keystone XL would have ""little impact"" on domestic gas prices. Alright, so the State Department released its findings on Keystone XL's impact in January. What's the hold up? The State Department concluded its review of the pipeline's impact in January, but was waiting on a Nebraska Supreme Court case over the pipeline's route to determine whether the pipeline project is in the U.S. national interest. That supreme court approved the pipeline's route through the state earlier this month, and the State Department has been reviewing that decision as it makes its final determinations. The State Department said the pipeline was not in the U.S. national interest in 2011, but TransCanada renewed its application in May 2012 after making changes to the proposed route. The State Department concluded in January 2014 that the Keystone XL pipeline would have a negligible impact on the environment . The White House has insisted it will let the State Department's process play it before Obama makes a final decision on whether or not to approve the pipeline. The State Department is expected to conclude its final review soon, once it finishes reviewing comments from various federal agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, which urged the State Department in a February letter to reconsider the negative environmental impact the pipeline would have. Obama has said his top concern in making a decision will be ""does it contribute to the greenhouse gases that are causing climate change."" For now at least, Obama will veto the Congressional legislation and Keystone XL is facing a dim future. Why Keystone XL matters .","The State Department reported the project would have minimal environmental impacts .
Proponents have touted economic benefits, but the proposal would generate few permanent jobs .
The production of oil from oil sands emits more greenhouse gases ."
"Southampton’s extraordinary start to the season, maintained with a brilliant opportunist’s goal from Victor Wanyama at the KC Stadium, has been built on the best defensive record in the country. The Saints have kept six clean sheets in 10 Premier League matches and conceded just five goals, two of them at Liverpool in the first match Ronald Koeman’s side played together. Nathaniel Clyne is a key component of the division’s best back line and the 23-year-old right-back sees no reason why this dream season cannot continue — for club and country. Nathaniel Clyne has been in impressive form for high-flying Southampton so far this season . Victor Wanyama's first-time effort from 40 yards out gave Southampton an early lead at the KC Stadium . ‘I think I’ve got the ability to play for my country. Hopefully I can get the call-up next time,’ he said. England manager Roy Hodgson was in the stands as Clyne gave another fine attacking full-back display at the KC Stadium. Southampton's five goals conceded is half the next lowest number in the Premier League, and the lowest per game in all of English football. He was an unused substitute in the last squad and hopes for another call-up ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia on November 15. Last time, I did.

A divorcee who convinced her lover, a former NFL player, to shoot dead her millionaire boyfriend to access his life insurance has been jailed for life. Nanette Ann Packard, 46, was convicted of murder earlier this year after her live-in boyfriend William McLaughlin was shot dead in his kitchen in December 1994. Packard was living with McLaughlin, 21 years her senior, while also dating former New England Patriots linebacker Eric Naposki, who worked as a bouncer at a local nightclub. Jailed: Nanette Ann Packard is led from court in handcuffs after being handed a life prison term yesterday . Theft: Packard's murder trial heard she also stole $500,000 from McLaughlin's estate both before and after his death . She convinced the former NFL star to murder McLaughlin, having stood to collect $1million on the medical technology boss's life insurance, along with a further $150,000 and free rent for a year in one of his properties. Naposki entered McLaughlin's lavish house in Newport Beach using a key given to him by Packard, and shot the millionaire in the chest six times. Killer: Eric Naposki, a former NFL linebacker, was the man who killed millionaire William McLaughlin by shooting him six times in the chest . Packard's murder trial earlier this year also heard she went on to steal at least $500,000 from McLaughlin's estate both before and after his death. She admitted grand theft in 1996 and was sentenced to a year in jail, but the murder case went cold for 13 years before new evidence in 2009 connected Packard and Naposki to the shooting. Authorities subsequently arrested Johnston, living in Ladera Ranch with her third husband, and Naposki, living in Greenwich, Connecticut. Investigators had long suspected Packard and Naposki, but it was only when new technology was used to identify the murder weapon, along with a new witness, that charges were filed. McLaughlin's family today branded Packard 'vile' as the mother-of-two was handed a life jail term without parole for the millionaire's murder, having been convicted of first degree murder in January. Naposki, 45, who played for the New England Patriots between 1988 and 1989, was convicted of first degree murder last July, and will be sentenced on August 10. The court heard during Packard's trial she met McLaughlin after he responded to an advert she had placed in a dating magazine for wealthy men. She had described herself as 'a well-educated woman who knows how to take care of her man'. Sugar daddy: William McLaughlin made a fortune in medical technologies, while Packard was set to gain £1m in his life insurance . McLaughlin was shot dead in the kitchen of his waterfront California home by Naposki, who had been given a key to the property by Packard . They began dating and she later moved in with McLaughlin, who made a fortune in medical technologies after developing a blood-filtering prototype. Speaking outside Orange County Superior COurt yesterday after Packard's sentencing, Kim McLaughlin Bayless said: 'The fact that you, Nanette, destroyed so many lives, including my Dad's, is vile. ...

In 1996, Packard pleaded guilty to writing checks from McLaughlin's account without his knowledge. During Naposki's trial, his defense attorney argued that Packard was the only one who had a motive to kill McLaughlin, who had a successful medical technology business.

"(CNN)  -- The Wu-Tang Clan -- the New York hip-hop supergroup that spawned millions of album sales, nine solo acts and a few acting careers -- almost never was. If RZA, left, had been jailed or Method Man killed, Wu-Tang may have never formed, RZA says. Method Man, the group's most recognizable voice, was nearly killed before the band formed, Wu-Tang's chief producer, RZA, writes in his forthcoming memoir. Meth was walking to buy marijuana at 160 Park Hill Avenue in Staten Island -- the house in Wu-Tang's ""Protect Ya Neck"" video -- when RZA saw him across the street, he writes in the book. ""Come over here, yo!"" RZA beckoned, according to ""The Tao of Wu"" (Riverhead). ""He stopped and came running over. A few seconds later -- pow-pow-pow-pow-pow! -- a guy started shooting up the front of 160. A buddy of ours, Poppy, an innocent, school-going, nice guy -- he was shot and killed right there.""  Interactive: Where's the Wu been? » . It wasn't the only close call RZA said could have snuffed the band that rewrote the rule book for hip-hop acts. The year before the group formed in 1993, RZA was acquitted on an attempted murder charge that could have put him behind bars for eight years, he writes in ""The Tao of Wu,"" out Thursday. Expanding on the book's anecdotes in an interview with CNN, RZA explained that if he had been imprisoned or if Method Man, aka Clifford Smith, had been killed, the band never would have come to fruition. RZA, whose real name is Robert Diggs and whose stage name is pronounced ""Rizza,"" also talked about his role in the death of his cousin, Russell Jones, better known as Ol' Dirty Bastard or ODB. Two days before his 36th birthday in 2004, ODB died in a New York recording studio from an overdose of cocaine and painkillers. RZA writes in the book that he once witnessed ODB force his own son to watch him do drugs. RZA tried to leave, he writes, but ODB wouldn't let him. Now, RZA told CNN, he wishes he would've been tougher with ODB about his drug problem. Following are excerpts from the interview, which has been edited for language, flow and length: . CNN: Could your imprisonment or Method Man's death have derailed Wu-Tang's formation? RZA: Either one of those incidents could definitely have derailed it. Of course, myself being the abbot, the one who came with the idea, if I wouldn't have made it out of that tumultuous time -- it seemed like I wasn't going to make it out of it; there was a lot of odds against me -- but we stood strong, and self-defense made sense to the jury. We beat that ... It was the victory over that incident that made me change my whole direction. In a way, it's double-edged in that incident. One, if I would've lost that, yeah, Wu-Tang wouldn't have happened, but also it's the victory of it that inspired me and gave me the drive also to go and really get serious about Wu-Tang and the things I was dealing with. Same thing with Meth, he always brings it up ... that that day saved his life. He actually said, if it was anybody else calling him, he wouldn't have came. CNN: In the book, you cite lessons from Eastern religions, Christianity, Islam, [Nation of Islam offshoot] Five Percent, numerology, comic books, kung fu, chess. What would you say to someone who says it's difficult to reconcile these dogmas? RZA: Like it says in the Bible, ""In the beginning was the word, and the word became flesh"" -- if we go to the root of the word, we will find that, yeah, everything is similar. Everything is teaching us all the same path. It's just that one religion was good for these people because of their living conditions. In the Quran, they mention paradise being filled with wells, wells of water, and if you're in the desert and you've got a chance to get water and gardens -- as they describe paradise in the holy Quran -- if you're going to get gardens, that's the paradise that fits your situation. ... Everything they're saying relates to the people they're talking to. ... You remove the messenger and take the message. CNN: You say in the book that your penchant for violent lyrics in your younger years ""was a product of my history and environment"" and that it no longer represents you. But you also say you won't repudiate violence. Why not? RZA: One reason I haven't repudiated it is because when it's necessary, it's necessary. [The Bible's] Ecclesiastes tell us there's a time for everything -- a time for war, a time for peace -- so in times for war, there's time for violence. Then in [the Hindu scripture] Bhagavad Gita, it says Arjuna was talking, Arjuna didn't want to commit violent acts against an army that was attacking him. He couldn't find it in his heart to do it. It was people he loved. He didn't want to get into violence, but Krishna had to point out to him, ""Your duty is your duty."" ... So, to me, violence in the light of justice is still violent, but I don't see it the same. It's because of justice that I don't repudiate violence because justice must be served somehow. CNN: ODB was a product of his environment as well. To what degree were you and other Wu-Tang members responsible for his death? RZA: The guys would say it's more me than them because they say that's my cousin and I was right there. If you let a man that you love or anybody -- man, woman or child that you love -- sit there and destroy themselves in front of you, you're neglecting them ... Everybody let him do what he wanted to do. ... There were times when I took his drugs and threw them down the toilet. When I do that, he would get so pissed off I don't see him for weeks after that. ... So it got to a point, I was like, ""[expletive] it, let him do his drugs"" just to have him around me, just to keep him there. ... But it's still neglect, yo. CNN: You say you ran Wu-Tang like a dictatorship in its first five years. I know you and Raekwon have had creative differences and Ghostface Killah is suing you over royalties. Ever regret the dictatorship approach? RZA: I don't regret it because it got us to the power we are. ... To me, in the beginning, the dictatorship led us to such a strong foundation that even though Wu-Tang seemed to be crumbling, it didn't fall because of the root foundation of one man's idea. But now as it's coming back together -- we're living in the twilight age of it right now -- it's still surviving because of the democracy of it. CNN: Wu-Tang is still around, but nothing like the heyday of the 1990s. Will we ever see a renaissance? RZA: Well, to me, Wu-Tang is beyond Wu-Tang Clan. ... It's just like hip-hop is beyond Grandmaster Flash, but Grandmaster Flash was one of the first guys to hit those turntables like that. ... The same thing with Wu-Tang. You'll see the difference in hip-hop from the moment we came in to before we came in. We changed it. We changed the whole structure. CNN: Have you accomplished everything you've set out to accomplish? RZA: I'm me and the me that's me is me and is going to continue to be me, and it's always reaching and growing. I'm grateful for what I've accomplished. I'm grateful for anyone who thinks I accomplished something and says, ""Well he did this; he did that."" I'm proud to be accepted, but I feel like I've just scratched the surface for some weird reason.

"Loss: Shanice Clark, 21, was found unresponsive in her dorm in Pennsylvania early on Sunday morning . A college basketball star has been found dead in her dorm room after choking on gum in her sleep, preliminary investigations have found. Shanice Clark, from Toronto, Canada, was found unresponsive at 3.03am on Sunday in Vulcan Village at the California University of Pennsylvania, the Washington County coroner's office said. She was rushed to Monongahela Valley Hospital but she could not be revived and was pronounced dead at 4.10am. Police said a preliminary report from medical personnel indicates Clark accidentally choked on gum while she was sleeping, the Pennsylvania Observer-Reporter reported. The manner of death continues to remain under investigation. University officials said they were 'deeply saddened' by the death of the 6-foot senior forward, who had played two dozen games for the Vulcans last season. Athletic director Karen Hjerpe called Clark 'a bright student and talented player' and said 'her smile and personality will be missed'. Clark, a communications major, had hoped to become a broadcaster and chose the school because of its good facilities after transferring from Santa Fe College in Florida. But friend Cleveland Clunis told the Toronto Star that she would often joke that she had gone to the university for a different reason. 'For Shanice, it was, ""There's a good hairstylist"",' said Clunis, the founder of a non-profit basketball program she had attended. 'When she shares that with you, you can't help but laugh.' He said that this sense of humor had made her popular among students and staff. 'She could start a conversation with you from morning and still have you laughing and interested till sundown,' he said. Geraldine M. Jones, interim university president, said in a statement: 'Our thoughts today are with the family of Shanice Clark, a senior from Ontario, Canada, who passed away early this morning. 'On behalf of California University of Pennsylvania, I extend my deepest sympathy to all of Shanice's family and friends. She will be missed by her teammates and coaches, her classmates, and by the entire campus community.' Clark leaves behind her mother, Kashaeka Fearon, and a younger sister.

Wenger attended the game at Wembley, having been in Paris on Friday when 129 people were killed there.
""The football world has a big union and togetherness,"" said the Frenchman.
""You always think after this kind of event - do you continue to play or do you stop your life?""
The Stade de France, which was hosting France's friendly against Germany, was targeted as part of Friday's attacks
Belgium's friendly with Spain on Tuesday and Germany's match against Netherlands were subsequently called off.
Wenger said the decision to play Tuesday's game at Wembley was right and thanked ""the English community"" for their show of solidarity.
He said: ""It was fantastic for France and it showed the class of England to see the arch of Wembley in French colours.
""Now we must get on with life and respond to the situation in a positive way. You can't stop everything. You have to focus on something else.""
Arsenal visit West Brom on Saturday (15:00 GMT), and Wenger said he will check that France international Laurent Koscielny is in the right frame of mind to play.
""You could see he was not himself on Tuesday,"" said Wenger. ""It has affected him deeply. He wasn't the same player.
""I will talk with him to see if he is completely recovered and focused. It is a big game for us. If he is not completely committed or feels ready I will not play him.""

"A new witness in the police shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, told CNN that Brown and the police officer tussled at the police car window, then the officer shot the teen multiple times, as Brown backed away. ""What I saw was when Michael and the cop were wrestling through the window,"" Tiffany Mitchell told CNN's Don Lemon. A shot was fired while Brown was out the window. He got free, and the officer got out of the vehicle, followed Brown and shot him, she said. He raised his hands, and the officer kept firing, she said. Police fired tear gas at a crowd of protesters late Wednesday for another night, as the group gathered to protest Brown's deadly shooting. Officers in riot gear then marched toward the protesters near a burned out gas station, which has become the gathering point for demonstrations. Police announced that they no longer considered the protest peaceful, before they fired the canisters, CNN producer Yon Pomrenze said. People fled in all directions, as the stinging clouds wafted by them. A separate small group of over a dozen people gathered outside Ferguson's police station holding up signs and chanting protests for a fifth day. Officer not named . Police have said Brown died in a dangerous struggle after trying to grab the officer's weapon, but witnesses say it seemed a brazen act of aggression by the officer on Saturday, and that Brown was unarmed and not threatening. On Wednesday, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told CNN that the officer had been hit and suffered swelling on the side of his face. He was taken to a hospital and released the same day, Jackson said. Five days have passed since Brown's killing, and the public still does not know the name of the person who pulled the trigger. There have been cries of a cover-up. ""That doesn't give the community confidence. That doesn't make it transparent,"" attorney Benjamin Crump told reporters. ""And remember, we've got a long way to go before this community starts to believe that the police are going to give them all the answers and not try to sweep it under the rug."" Crump was one of the attorneys who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the teenager who was killed in a 2012 altercation with Florida man George Zimmerman. But Mayor James W. Knowles said police have received death threats against the officer and his family. They want to prevent further violence, he said. Hackers have gone after his personal information and worked people up against members of government and the police, he said. A town in turmoil -- 5 things about Ferguson, Missouri . Trouble at night . Police have asked protesters to restrict their gatherings to daylight hours, after violence has broken out repeatedly after nightfall. Protests during the day have been peaceful. Protests on Sunday and Monday ended with clashes with police and looting . Police have made 47 arrests after Brown's shooting, KMOV reported. ""We understand the anger; we understand that people want answers. We understand that we've got a problem, but we're just asking people to be peaceful,"" Jackson said. The Ferguson-Florissant School District announced that it was pushing back the start of classes this year. School had been scheduled to resume Thursday. Civil rights . Federal civil rights investigators and the FBI carry out their own inquiry into the controversial case. In the town of 21,000, there's a history of distrust between the predominantly black community and the largely white police force. ""Race relations is a top priority right now and, as I said, I'm working with the Department of Justice to improve that,""  Jackson told reporters Wednesday. Only three of the city's 53 officers are African-American, and Jackson said he is working to change that. Dorian Johnson, who said he saw the shooting, told CNN on Tuesday that the officer who opened fire is white.

Iran leader: Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . Both Israel and America think Iran's programme under the leadership of  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is aimed at developing bombs, and not for peaceful purposes as Tehran claims. Iran has threatened to shut down the Strait of Hormuz, which is used by 40 per cent of the world's oil tankers, in revenge for sanctions imposed on the country. But the U.S. has insisted that it will not allow Iran to choke off one of the world's busiest shipping routes and an American military official said that 'any disruption will not be tolerated.' A Pentagon spokesman warned that Iran would destroy its own 'economic lifeline' if it disrupted the international oil trade. Tensions rose after Iran’s top naval commander bragged that shutting down the Gulf would be ‘easier than drinking a glass of water.’ And they continued to escalate with Iran revealing one of its surveillance planes has recorded video and photographed a U.S. aircraft carrier near an area where it was carrying out military maneuvers . If Iran were successfully to block access to the Strait of Hormuz, the price of crude oil would almost certainly rise dramatically. Following a mistaken report last year that the strait had already been closed, the oil price jumped by $2, to over $100 a barrel. A senior Saudi official has insisted in the past that Gulf nations would be able to make up for any shortfall caused by the sanctions, but this would be of little use if Iran succeeded in cutting off the strait.",America fears Tehran nuclear programme is aimed at developing bombs .
"Stoke Field on 16 June 1487 saw the final attempt by the House of York to seize the crown after decades of war.
Despite involving more soldiers and having higher casualties, it is overshadowed by Bosworth, which saw the death of Richard III two years earlier.
But a weekend of events at Stoke Hall, near Newark in Nottinghamshire, will help mark its 530th anniversary.
While Bosworth witnessed the death of the last Plantagenet king, those supporting the Yorkist cause had found a new figurehead.
A man claiming to be Edward, Earl of Warwick, one of the Princes in the Tower, had prompted a handful of nobles to rally to his cause.
He was, in fact, a commoner called Lambert Simnel and it was likely that the rebel commander, John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, had his own eyes on the crown.
Henry VII's army of about 15,000 was twice the size of his enemy and, despite some initial resistance, Simnel's force was routed.
In an unusual display of medieval mercy Simnel was pardoned and employed in the royal kitchens as a servant.
Re-enactment expert Allan Harley of the Beaufort Companye said: ""The battle is largely forgotten because the Tudor dynasty wanted it that way.
""They did not want anyone to think a pretender to the throne could raise an army and mount a challenge.
""But it should be remembered because it was the last swansong of the House of York.
""The Battle of Bosworth put the Tudors in charge but this battle was really the start of the Tudor dynasty.""

"By . Nick Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 03:10 EST, 26 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:55 EST, 27 June 2012 . Cait Reilly, pictured, yesterday asked the High Court to declare the Government¿s back-to-work programme unlawful . A graduate made to work for her jobless benefits as a shelf stacker in Poundland yesterday claimed the scheme amounted to ‘forced labour’ which breached her human rights. Cait Reilly yesterday asked the High Court to declare the Government’s back-to-work programme unlawful after she was required to work in the budget store or risk losing her £53.45-a-week jobseeker’s allowance. The 23-year-old said she had to give up a voluntary post in a museum to take the placement but was promised a job interview if she completed two weeks training at Poundland. However, she says, that never materialised. The Government is fighting her claim . and strongly denies that its flagship work programme, which has placed . thousands of jobseekers on unpaid placements since its launch last year, . is equivalent to ‘slave labour’. Unemployed . mechanic Jamieson Wilson, 41, is also challenging the legality of . another Government work scheme that compels the jobless to take unpaid . work. Lawyers for the pair . are seeking a judicial review into the Department for Work and Pensions . programme, saying it violates Article 4 of the European Convention on . Human Rights, which prohibits forced labour and slavery. The . schemes, championed by Employment Minister Chris Grayling, aim to help . 250,000 young people over the next two years through training and unpaid . experience in the public, private and charity sectors. Placement-providers include chains such as Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Argos and . Asda. Miss Reilly, who graduated in geology . from Birmingham University in 2010, was placed on the scheme after . attending a retail jobs ‘open day’ in October last year at the . suggestion of her Jobcentre Plus adviser. Legal challenge: Cait Reilly, pictured, was 'forced' to leave her voluntary work at a museum to stack shelves at Poundland or risk losing her benefits . Only after attending was she told she had to undertake a period of training or risk losing her benefits. Nathalie Lieven, QC, appearing for . Miss Reilly, said her placement at Poundland, near her home in Kings . Heath, Birmingham, involved carrying out ‘menial’ tasks, adding: ‘Such . work did not contribute to (Miss Reilly’s) search for work to any . extent.’ Miss Reilly had undertaken the work under ‘menace of penalty’ in breach of her human rights, she added. Unhappy: Cait Reilly is shown outside the Poundland store in Birmingham where she claims she was forced to work . The court was told Poundland is a successful firm with a net turnover of £500million, and her placement did not contribute to the public interest. Miss Lieven told Mr Justice Foskett the way in which the back-to-work programme was administered was ‘blatantly unlawful’, and had put thousands at risk of unfairly losing their benefits. She also accused the Government of ‘seemingly sub-delegating to private sector providers’ how the schemes were run, including whether those who refused unpaid work should lose benefits. Miss Lieven added: ‘These claimants have an entitlement to subsistence-level benefits. 'Taking away these subsistence-level benefits for up to six months is in many ways just as fundamental as being detained as an immigrant in prison.’ The court heard that Mr Wilson, also from the Midlands, had been unemployed since 2008. He was told last November he would be required to undertake up to six months of unpaid work cleaning furniture. After refusing, he had his benefits cut, and now faces the loss of his jobseeker’s allowance for six months. Paul Nicholls, QC, appearing for the DWP, argued that both legal challenges were ‘wrong in law’. He said the purpose of the schemes was to assist the long-term jobless to better equip themselves for work, and thousands of people in different situations had benefited. The case continues.

"Graffiti mocking Hillary Clinton has been plastered across the streets surrounding a restaurant where she is hosting a fundraiser for Democratic Congressional candidates on Monday. The Tavern Restaurant in Brentwood, LA, is now covered in evil winged monkeys from the Wizard Of Oz. Instead of carrying the Wicked Witch Of The West, they are holding a sign that reads: 'Hillary 2016'. Sting: Republican street artist Sabo hung evil winged monkeys with Hillary 2016 signs along the streets surrounding the Tavern Restaurant where the former First Lady will be hosting a fundraiser on Monday . Mocking: The monkeys are fictional characters that carry the Wicked Witch Of The West in The Wizard Of Oz . It is the latest strike by the anti-Obama artist known  as Sabo, who earlier this year covered Gwyneth Paltrow's Hollywood home in posters featuring her face and the words 'Obama drone' ahead of a fundraiser for the president. Clinton's $32,400-a-head fundraiser is set to lure influential Hollywood figures including Steven Spielberg and Disney Studios Chairman Alan Horn. But with just three days to go, the event has been marred by Sabo's mocking posters. He has also created a fake website for the Tavern which describes its clientele as 'big money, Hollywood Fat Cats', and other Hillary 2016 memorabilia including t-shirts and stickers. Anonymous: The artist has spent 15 years creating anti-Democrat graffiti to act as 'the other voice' in LA . Large-scale project: He revealed on his website that he has also made stickers and t-shirts to mock Hillary . Hillary Clinton has not yet confirmed she plans to bid for the Democrat presidential nomination in 2016. She has lambasted claims that her vocal presence on the mid-terms campaign trail is simply a 'warm-up', insisting she wants the focus to be on next month's candidates. However, Sabo has taken aim at the former First Lady in an overnight sting. This morning, he gleefully tweeted from the account @unsavoryagents: 'SNEAK PEEK - ABOUT LAST NIGHT' with an early morning photograph of one of the monkeys hanging from a lamp post. He told The Hollywood Reporter in an email: 'All these leftists, I'm tired of their s***'. The website describes Clinton as 'a tired old hag who can't stop wishing she was President'. On the campaign trail: Clinton has lambasted claims her vocal presence in the mid-terms is her own warm-up . For the last 15 years, LA-based Sabo has been creating right-leaning street art to be 'the other voice' in contrast with liberal graffiti artist Shepard Fairey, who designed the 2008 Obama Hope poster.

"The video shows the bird briefly lifting the child in a Montreal park before dropping him unharmed.
Nearly 17 million people have watched the video on YouTube in three days.
But a digital training centre in Montreal later told the BBC that the clip was made by its students as part of a degree course.
Suzanne Guevremont, director of the Centre NAD, said the clip had been produced by four students who ""had an idea of making something believable"".
The students - who were doing a degree in 3D animation and digital design - had come up with the idea after a brainstorming session, completing the project in seven weeks, she said.
""It's a challenge... they wanted to test their skills,"" Ms Guevremont said.
She added that the bird and the child seen being snatched were all computer generated imagery (CGI), and the only real things in the video were the park, the boy (after being dropped on the ground) and his father comforting him.
The CGI was dropped into real footage to create the effect.
Some YouTube and Twitter users expressed doubts about the authenticity of the clip soon after it was posted online on 18 December.",A video of a golden eagle snatching a child in Canada that has gone viral online was an elaborate hoax aimed at testing the skills of the clipmakers.

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 4:12 PM on 7th February 2012 . Behind bars: 'The She-Devil' Margaret Gilheaney who has been jailed for ten years following the attacks . A mother-of-two nicknamed 'The She-Devil' after being involved in savage unprovoked attacks on two men with her feral teenage children has been jailed for 10 years. Margaret Gilheaney, 36, was arrested after the first victim, Jordan Daley, was battered with a bottle by her son Joseph, 19, in their 'dirty and smelly' £30,000 terraced property in Accrington, Lancashire. He needed 51 stitches and was scarred for life following the attack which happened as he celebrated his 18th birthday. The mother-of-two was then also involved as a father-of-three was stabbed 14 times. Matthew Howard, 27, thought he was going to die after being attacked by Margaret and her daughter Isabel, 18. He was dragged out into the alleyway and abandoned. He suffered a collapsed lung, nerve damage and was left disabled. While he was in hospital he missed the birth of his youngest child three days later when he was in hospital. Both attacks were meted out for pleasure by the teenage children at separate rowdy parties. After Margaret and her children were jailed one neighbour said: 'People called her the She-Devil . because of all the problems at her house and none of us are surprised . her brood turned out to be little horrors too.' Her daughter Isabel was jailed for six years while her son Joseph was given eight years. Sarah Booth, prosecuting, told Burnley Crown Court that as Mr Daley, 18, tried to leave the party in August 2010, at the grim family home but Gilheaney and his friends followed him outside and attacked him. The victim was repeatedly hit and kicked while he lay on the ground screaming for help. Miss Booth said: 'He believed he was knocked unconscious and a witness described everyone piling on top of the victim and the defendant. 'Another onlooker told how Mr Daley ended up with a hole in his lip, his nose split in half and with deep cuts all over his face and body. Jailed: Joseph and Isabel, both 19, who carried out the attacks on Jordan Daley and Matthew Howard in Accrington, Lancashire . 'Mr Daley and his friends finally got away, were chased as they left and he went to hospital, where he had 26 stitches to his face and 25 in his arms.' The court heard police later made several arrests. Then last February, while Gilheaney was on bail, Mr Howard was attacked as he tried to leave the family's 'dirty and smelly' home. Miss Booth said Maughan locked the door, became aggressive and clenched his fist as if he was going to punch him. The victim took a 'pre-emptive' strike before a brawl broke out. The prosecutor added: 'Mr Howard felt what he thought were punches to his back, felt warm and weak and turned to see Margaret and Isabel Gilheaney with a machete type knife. 'He collapsed on the floor on his back, felt numb all over and couldn’t move his leg. Isabel Gilheaney passed the knife to her partner who continued the attack. Grim: The 'dirty and smelly' mid-terrace property, worth £40,000, where Margaret Gilheaney lived with her children . 'Maughan wielded the weapon towards the victim’s face, Mr Howard put up his arms to protect himself and was gashed. She-Devil: Roseanne Barr stars in the 1989 film . 'The victim thought he was going to die and drifted in and out of consciousness. He pleaded with the defendant to stop, telling his assailants he had three children. 'Maughan tried unsuccessfully to pull him up by his neck and the three defendants then dragged him into the back yard, down a step and left him in the back street. He believed he was going to die there alone in the alley.' Margaret later called an ambulance but falsely claimed she had just come across Mr Howard in the street. Mr Howard said of his attackers : 'I feel the public will not be safe if they are released.' The court heard when questioned by police, Margaret Gilheaney claimed self defence and her children denied any involvement. However, she admitted violent disorder and wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Isabel, who lives with her mother and has racked up 20 previous convictions, admitted wounding with intent. Joseph, who has 35 previous . convictions, admitted wounding with intent and affray. He also admitted . chasing two neighbours down the street with a two-and-a-half foot . machete in a separate incident.

"The falls came after the head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers suggested that the Cyprus model, which involves a tax on bank deposits, could form a template in any future bailout.
On Monday morning, hopes the deal would solve the crisis lifted shares.
By 15:30 GMT, all major European markets had fallen into negative territory, joined by US stocks.
The president of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, later addressed his country in a television broadcast.
The deal was ""painful"" but the best that could have been struck under the circumstances, he said.
He said that controls limiting restricting the movement of capital would be temporary and he promised to protect the weak, saying that welfare payments would be met.
Earlier, markets in Europe and the US moved downwards when Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch Finance Minister who as head of the Eurogroup played a key role in the Cyprus negotiations, said the deal represented a new template for resolving future eurozone banking problems.
""If there is a risk in a bank our first question should be 'OK, what are you in the the bank going to do about that?',"" he told Reuters and the Financial Times.
He later added a clarification saying that Cyprus was ""a specific case with exceptional challenges"".
The Cyprus deal puts the burden for dealing with problem banks on their shareholders and creditors - in this particular case, customers with large bank balances - rather than the government and taxpayers - and bondholders, who lend through financial markets.
Our World Economics Editor, Andrew Walker, pointed out the more usual approach to failing banks in the current crisis has been for the state to inject new capital.
He says that Cyprus's banks are unusual in that they have relatively low amounts of financial market investors which could be tapped.
In the past, nations such as Ireland have pumped billions of taxpayers' money into propping up their banks, rather than risk upsetting large investors and spooking the financial system.
Mr Dijsselbloem said the pattern for bank rescues should see shareholders take the first hit, then bond holders, who lend money through financial markets, and only then should depositors with large bank balances be tapped.
By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor
But Mr Dijsselbloem's remarks raised fears that other European countries with struggling banks may face the same solution as Cyprus, which agreed to force those with cash on deposit above 100,000 euros (Â£85,000), many of whom are Russian, to pay a substantial tax.
Cyprus will receive 10bn euros ($13bn; Â£8.5bn) in bailout funds, but has agreed to a major restructuring of its banks.
Small savers will be protected but Cyprus's second largest bank - Laiki Bank - will be wound up and split into ""good"" and ""bad"" banks, with its good assets eventually merged into the Bank of Cyprus, the country's biggest bank.
The two banks will remain closed until Thursday, while all others will reopen on Tuesday after being closed for more than a week, Cyprus's central bank says.
By Robert PestonBusiness editor
The Cypriot government suggested that account holders with deposits of more than 100,000 euros should expect to lose about 30% of their balances.
The UK's FTSE 100 index ended the day down 0.2%, while Germany's Dax gave up 0.5%, and France's Cac lost 1.1%. In New York, the Dow Jones was 0.5% lower.
In Madrid, the market slipped 2.5% while the Milan index was down 2.27%.
The euro was also driven lower, falling to a six-week low against the pound. The euro was down 0.6% to 84.74 pence.
Jeroen Dijsselbloem
The new deal for Cyprus, unlike previous agreements, does not require the approval of the Cypriot parliament.
The uncertainty over the future of Cyprus in the eurozone was sparked a week ago when its parliament rejected an earlier bailout deal, which also included a controversial bank levy.
Despite the Cypriot economy's relatively small size, many analysts had been concerned that the crisis would spread to the wider eurozone, had Cyprus been forced to give up the single currency.
There were fears that the country's possible exit from the euro would trigger a loss of confidence across the single currency bloc, and prompt investors to withdraw from other troubled economies, such as Greece.
However, while Cyprus is now likely to remain in the eurozone, the country still faces significant obstacles as it attempts to recover from the crisis.
The EU-IMF deal involves a massive restructuring of the Cypriot banking system, as well as austerity measures and tax increases.
There has also been significant public anger in Cyprus at the intervention of European authorities, and the credibility of the Cypriot government has been questioned.
""We see a risk that Cyprus' sovereign debt burden post-bailout might not be sustainable, as the country is likely to enter a deep recession caused by the shrinkage of the banking sector and severe deleveraging,"" warned Reinhard Cluse, an economist at UBS.",European and US stock markets have fallen despite the agreement of a bailout deal for Cyprus.
"By . Ted Thornhill . The traditional dimpled glass pint tankard is usually associated with old men wearing flat caps – but the chunky-handled beer jug is now proving a big pull among pub-going hipsters. In the early 2000s it seemed that the handled pint jug – which first appeared in pubs in the late 1920s - was on the road to extinction. The last British factory to make the handled beer jug, Ravenhead Glass in St Helens, closed down in 2001, pub landlords found straight pint glasses easy to stack in dishwashers – and beer drinkers preferred them, too. But a beer jug revival is now underway thanks to trendy drinkers and city hotspots embracing them – and Al Murray the Pub Landlord toasting his audiences with them. Cheers! Al Murray the Pub Landlord with a traditional dimpled pint jug . The Shacklewell Arms in Dalston, east London, a popular haunt with hipster-types, has been serving dimpled jugs for the past six months. It offers straight glasses, too, but it’s the jugs that the customers prefer. General Manager Rose Dennen told MailOnline: 'The new love of dimpled pint glasses is part and parcel of the revival of the traditional idea of living. People are more aware of what they're putting in their bodies. It's all about being kind to yourself and being aware of your heritage and part and parcel of that is a return to craft beer. 'People aren't drinking less, but drinking better quality products.' Dimpled mugs have been served in Leeds’ North Bar since 2000, with director Christian Townsley revealing that his mainly artistic clientele love the ‘old-school coolness’ of a dimpled tankard, according to the BBC. Pint jug revival: The Shacklewell Arms in east London has seen its hipster clientele embrace handled pint pots . Cask in hand: Shacklewell Arms hipster Dan Woodall enjoys a beer in a handled pint jug . Keeping a handle on things: Shacklewell Arms General Manager Rose Dennen . Top choice: Straight pint glasses are the most popular type with drinkers, but hipsters are embracing dimpled tankards . Traditional designs: The 10-sided beer jug arrived in 1928, left, while the dimpled handled pint pot, pictured right, arrived in 1948 . Evolution: Straight glasses were very popular in the early 20th century and then in the 1960s, but their rims would often nick when they touched, so the nonic glass, right, was brought in to stop this happening . Pint glasses were straight from the beginning of the 20th century up until around 1928, when the 10-sided handled glass pint mug appeared in pubs. In 1948 the dimpled pint jug design arrived, which proved more popular than its 10-sided cousin. According to beer blogger Martyn Cornell, this new trend coincided with lighter coloured beers being embraced. He said: 'The arrival of the dimple coincided with the triumph of bitter over (dark) mild, and amber beers look better in dimpled glasses than in straight-sides ones: the light shining through a pint of bitter in a dimpled glass is the beery equivalent of the windows of Salisbury or Chartres.' Straight pint glasses became all the rage in the 1960s, but their rims easily chipped when they touched, so the 'nonik' - or 'no nick' - glass was invented, which has a bulge in the middle. This meant the glasses touched at a sturdier point and so didn't have to be replaced so often. Lofty, narrow glasses are in vogue these days - often emblazoned with the logo of a beer brand. Source: Martyn Cornell's Zythophile - Beer now and then . He added: ‘They are solid and reassuringly comforting.’ Neil Walker, spokesperson for the . Campaign For Real Ale, said that some pubs use traditional pint pots to . help drinkers distinguish between brands. He told MailOnline: ‘It's fantastic to see dimpled pint glasses making something of a comeback as real ale continues to grow in popularity, particularly in venues which might not have previously served cask beer. ‘Britain is in the middle of a real ale revolution. With well over a thousand breweries now producing real ale, your local pub is now much more likely to be serving a locally produced brew. 'Many pubs which are expanding their beer range are using these traditional pint pots to differentiate their cask beers from mainstream lager brands, something which can only be good for British beer drinkers.’ The Pub Landlord, meanwhile, is also toasting the dimpled pint jug's return. He said: 'The return of these glasses is a triumph. Each one looks like a precious cut diamond but contains something better than 24 carats: one pint. For the first time in my life I salute the young and trendy. Though they should all bloody shave.' Recent research shows that craft beer isn't just proving evermore popular in trendy pubs, but is catching wine as the drink of choice to take to dinner parties. Over half of Brits say they already prefer to take beer, not wine to dinner parties, or plan to make the switch soon, according to a new nationwide poll, by online marketplace EeBria. The site found that the trend is most pronounced among under 35s, who are 20 per cent more likely to drink craft beer over wine at social occasions than older generations. A number of factors are driving the shift in attitudes, the research showed, with 60 per cent of respondents saying they see craft beers as the ideal way to explore new exciting flavours with friends and almost half believe craft beer sparks more interesting conversation than wine.

"The fight started slowly but came to life and ended in brutal fashion as both slugged it out until the end.
Groves, 23, was wobbled in the third and was cut badly in the 11th but boxed stylishly throughout to earn victory.
Unbeaten Groves earned a majority decision, one judge scoring it 115-115 while the other two had it at 115-114.
In contrast to the explosive build-up to the fight, the first round at the O2 Arena was cagey and tense with DeGale, who was booed on his way into the ring, shading it by landing the only scoring shots and ending with a sharp left jab.
Whether it was respect or more likely nerves, neither boxer seemed to settle in the opening minute of the second round with both throwing just single shots. But Groves improved as the round wore on and landed a decent right on the bell.
The fencing and feinting continued into the third before DeGale landed a right hook to the top of the head of Groves, who responded with one of his own while also later throwing two jabs that found the target.
It was a fascinating start to the contest which Groves had just about shaded but he appeared marked below the right eye.
Groves continued to impress with two-punch combinations and seemed to be in control of the fourth round but a solid left hook in the final minute wobbled him and DeGale unleashed a cluster of punches to finish on top.
DeGale took a strong right hand at the start of the fifth and Groves' footwork was proving frustrating for his opponent who chased but could not catch his rival. Groves then landed a further right that appeared to hurt the tense-looking Olympic gold medallist.
It was another quiet start to the sixth that drew boos from the 19,000 crowd, and that seemed to spur on DeGale who landed a big left that hurt Groves. DeGale followed that up with another left as he tried to assert himself and he continued on the front foot, landing a quality straight left on the bell.
DeGale began the seventh round confidently as Groves' defence continued to drop lower but he still managed to land a clubbing left. DeGale responded with a left of his own with his punches seeming to hold more power and the round ended with a left uppercut from the British champion.
A straight left from DeGale rocked Groves and sparked the Commonwealth champion into life but despite boxing much of the eighth round on the front foot he failed to land a meaningful punch.
Groves boxed behind his jab in the ninth, inviting DeGale to box on the front foot. There was a flurry of punches and after a clash of head a cut opened up above the left eye of Groves.
The final minute of the ninth round was the most entertaining of the fight with both boxers opening up as DeGale rocked his opponent with 30 seconds to go and then, just before the bell, had him wobbling with a huge left, which had Groves desperately holding on.
Groves still appeared dazed at the start of the 10th but found success with his jab, although his punches appeared to lack spite with DeGale looking the more dangerous fighter.
In the final minute of the round they again trade punches, with Groves taking a big right hook to the side of the head, and both boxers went to their stools with bloodied faces following a brutal exchange.
With two rounds to go the fight was in the balance, and another clash of heads resulted in a huge cut opening up on the forehead of Groves which attracted a lot of attention from the referee.
Perhaps sensing the fight could be stopped, Groves opened up and DeGale showed great skill in picking off his opponent who looked desperate and battered.
But Groves battled on despite cuts on his forehead, left eye and right cheekbone and DeGale hurt his opponent again with a left but they again traded and landed in a contest that was turning into a classic.
Going into the final round DeGale looked the fresher, but Groves landed more scoring punches, with both boxers knowing they needed a big performance to secure victory.
DeGale landed a right but his momentum was checked by a big right uppercut from Groves. However, it was the British champion who ended the fight on top, opening up against a tiring Groves and they slugged it out right until the final bell.
The decision was contentious with Groves earning his 13th straight victory while DeGale, who disputed the decision, suffered his first defeat in 11 professional fights.
Groves, who also beat his opponent as an amateur, was content to prove the doubters wrong and claimed he would be willing to fight DeGale again.
""Everyone was raving about him. Only two favoured me in a boxing news poll, but I have self belief,"" he told BBC 5 Live.
""It feels good. I knew I'd won. I knew I'd done enough.""
He added: ""I will fight him again yeah if everything is all right and it's the right way. But now I have beaten him twice.""
Earlier, middleweight Billy Joe Saunders inflicted the first stoppage of veteran Kevin Hammond's career to win in two rounds.
While Frankie Gavin won the vacant WBO Inter-Continental welterweight title on points after a relatively uninspiring performance against the negative Young Mutley.",George Groves inflicted the first loss of James DeGale's professional career to win the British super-middleweight title after a gripping bout in London.

"Frank Lampard captains England against Costa Rica on Tuesday and will then quit international football despite Roy Hodgson suggesting he still has an international future. Lampard thinks it is the appropriate time to bow out and will do so having won 106 caps. He has an offer to play in Major League Soccer with New York City next season and that could lead to him playing in the Premier League on loan. He will finish with just two fewer international caps than his father Frank senior’s West Ham pal and former England captain Bobby Moore. One last time: Frank Lampard is expected to play his last England game against Costa Rica . History boy: Lampard could become England's second youngest scorer at a World Cup if he nets on Tuesday . Lampard’s record of 29 England goals is impressive, although Charlton hit 49 and remains England's top all-time scorer with Wayne Rooney closing the gap on 40. If Lampard scores on Tuesday he will become the second oldest player to score a goal at World Cup finals for England having turned 36 four days ago. The oldest was Sir Tom Finney, who scored a late penalty in the 2-2 draw against Soviet Union in 1958 at the age of 36 and 64 days. Although . Steven Gerrard has asked for some time to consider his international . future it is unlikely Roy Hodgson will persuade him to change his mind . on calling it a day with England.

In the last four World Cup finals Germany’s Miroslav Klose has scored 15 goals compared to total of 17 by England over the same period. Whether or not Didier Drogba starts against Greece on Tuesday, he will no doubt have an impact on the game at some stage. Drogba, who will quit international football at the end of the World Cup, will be determined to make sure that this game is not his last for the Ivory Coast. Perhaps one of the reasons for his longevity is that the 36-year-old didn’t start a professional career until he was 21 with Le Mans. High flyer: Didier Drogba may play his last game for the Ivory Coast against Greece on Tuesday . There is a growing feeling that too many young English strikers get burned out because they play far too much at a younger age - take the case of Michael Owen. And there is an argument, endorsed by Paul Scholes, that at 28 Wayne Rooney has already peaked. At the same age Drogba moved into his pomp at Chelsea. And even a bit of racy lifestyle didn’t seem to harm Drogba. In his early days his team-mates called him 'Tupac' after the America rap because of his penchant for a wild nightlife. Watch Out for...

Kagawa’s career at Manchester United could be revived under Louis van Gaal, but if the Dutchman doesn’t see him as part of his plans then he could return to Borussia Dortmund. O ....the Japan-Columbia game is at  9pm on BBC 3, Ivory Coast-Greece is on BBC1 at the same time. I – say :Ahead of an World Cup qualifier against Poland in 1990, Ian Wright once explained with a combination of  Churchillian rhetoric and 'Sarf London Caribbean slang' that England would win because of 'The bulldog spirit, man'. They did the next night at Wembley when a combination of panache and passion saw England blow Poland apart 3-0. Such virtues seem very much out of fashion now - laughed off as 'old school' - while the appliance of more and more sports science is seen as the way forward. Young tyro: Paul Gascoigne scores for England against Poland at Wembley . Left-field bolt: Stuart Pearce scores for England against Poland at Wembley in 1990 . But a bloated back room staff of medics, spin and head doctors has hardly succeeded. If anything it’s given the players more excuses and made them more mentally fragile . Indeed when you listen to what makes other countries tick many cite national pride and desire the very qualities that are laughed off by football 'hipsters' in this country. Explaining Spain’s demise Xavi Alonso spoke of a lack of 'hunger'. When Harry Redknapp suggested that some Tottenham players made excuses NOT to join up with England it raises questions about the motivation of many when it comes to playing for England. On that front perhaps the FA should find some sort of role for Ian Wright in the camp. On the notion that there are players who duck out of playing for England Wright has said: 'The next young player who says he does not want play for England should be ordered to ring the parents of a soldier who has dies in Afghanistan, and tell him his reasons.' Well said Wrighty. That’s the bulldog spirit, man. World Cup Moment: . Belo Horizonte, where England face Costa Rica on Tuesday, is of course the venue of England’s most infamous defeat when they were beaten 1-0 by the USA in 1950. Shock: England lost to USA 1-0 in 1950 thanks to a goal from GaetJens (right) At the time England were regarded as the best team in the world with players like Sir Tom Finney and Stan Mortenson - although Stanley Matthews was dropped for the match. England also lost to Spain 1-0 and were eliminated, although, they did beat Chile 2-1. The chastening experience suffered is said to have inspired England’s right back at that World Cup  to one day make amends and lift the trophy. His name? Alfred Ramsey. World Cup Bet: . The patriotic pound has proved very profitable for the bookies at the World Cup. So it’s difficult to see the attraction of 4/5 on an England win…although Costa Rica are resting players which maybe explains why you can 7/2 on them winning with the draw 11-4. A romantic punt for first goal scorer is Frank Lampard at 10-1; Joel Campbell is 13-2 to open the scoring for Costa Rica. Uruguay are 13-2 to beat Italy.","Lampard expected to retire from international football after the World Cup .

"By . Daniel Martin . Controversial: The health watchdog NICE has called for more obese people with the condition to be considered for a gastric band or bypass . Free weight-loss surgery could be offered to nearly a million diabetes patients. The health watchdog yesterday called for more obese people with the condition to be considered for a gastric band or bypass. At a stroke, NICE’s ruling doubles to 1.8million the numbers qualifying for taxpayer-funded surgery. But campaigners said it was wrong to offer operations costing £5,000 when the NHS faces a £30billion deficit and NICE is denying cancer patients life-extending drugs. They warned the obese should instead be told to eat less and exercise more. ‘We’ve got a mismatch between what NICE recommends and what the country can afford,’ said Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum. ‘Thousands of people will look at this and say – I fit that criteria, I want the surgery. This is going to stretch clinical commissioning groups to the limit – we’ve got a creaking Health Service as it is. We could end up with a situation where clinical commissioning groups say we can’t get the extra midwives we need for the local hospital, we can’t pay for life-saving drugs for people with cancer – because other people have been given the right to have expensive bariatric surgery.’ The surgery covers procedures including gastric bands and gastric bypasses, where the digestive system is rerouted past most of the stomach. NICE said a gastric bypass on the NHS costs £5,410 and a gastric band £2,473. Weight-loss surgery is given to patients who are morbidly obese with a body mass index score of more than 40. It is also offered to those who have a BMI over 35 with another serious health condition, such as type 2 diabetes. Around a million people qualify under these rules – although in practice only around 10,000 operations are carried out every year. But now NICE is suggesting that diabetics with a BMI score of 30 or more should be considered for an assessment for weight-loss operations on the NHS. Diabetes UK says the new rules mean between 850,000 and 900,000 extra people could qualify. Rise: The ruling would double the number of people who could qualify for taxpayer-funded surgery to 1.8million . It will be up to individual clinical commissioning groups, which hold local NHS budgets, to decide whether the surgery should be funded in their areas. Britain is in the grip of an obesity epidemic and 2.9million people now have diabetes, a condition which in its type 2 form is linked to poor lifestyle. Mark Baker, director of clinical practice at NICE, said: ‘Obesity rates have nearly doubled over the past ten years and continue to rise, making obesity and overweight a major issue for the Health Service. ‘Updated evidence suggests people who are obese and have been recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes may benefit from weight loss surgery. More than half of people who undergo surgery have more control over their diabetes following surgery and are less likely to have diabetes-related illness; in some cases surgery can even reverse the diagnosis.’ NICE says that by losing weight patients can reduce the damaging consequences of diabetes, such as the risk of blindness or heart attack. Its guidance states that an operation is repaid in savings to the NHS within three years. After that, there are gains of around £4,000 per year per patient. But Roger Goss of Patient Concern said: ‘NICE doesn’t seem to know the NHS is heading for a deficit. They are wasting our money. Obese people should be encouraged to eat less and take more exercise – rather than having this expensive treatment paid for.’ Simon O’Neill, from the charity Diabetes UK, said: ‘Bariatric surgery should only be considered as a last resort if serious attempts to lose weight have been unsuccessful and if the person is obese. ‘It can lead to dramatic weight loss, which in turn may result in a reduction in people taking their type 2 diabetes medication and even in some people needing no medication at all. This does not mean, however, that type 2 diabetes has been cured. ‘These people will still need to eat a healthy balanced diet and be physically active.’ The BMI score is a simple measure based on height and weight with a score higher than 25 indicating overweight and 30 or more being judged as obese.","Watchdog believes more people should be considered for gastric bands .

"Accidentally brought your marijuana to the Aspen/Pitkin County Airport? Don't worry. Pitkin County Sheriff Joe DiSalvo plans to install amnesty boxes at the airport, possibly as soon as next week, for people traveling out of state. ""We'll have signs around the airport saying that although marijuana is legal in this state, it may be illegal in your final destination,"" DiSalvo told CNN. ""This is an opportunity to dispose of your marijuana with no legal consequences."" But don't try to fly with that marijuana, not even departing from the pot-happy states of Colorado and Washington. Both states allow adults 21 and older to have up to an ounce of marijuana, but those policies are at odds with federal law. Leave the brownies at home, too -- even in states where it's legal, it's not yet clear how marijuana-laced food is evaluated under those limits. The Transportation Security Administration seized 36 ounces of marijuana-laced food in a passenger's checked luggage at the Aspen airport earlier this month, and the federal agency referred the case to the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office, DiSalvo confirmed. (The edibles' amount of THC, the active ingredient in cannabis, was much less than the weight of the food. The sheriff's office declined to press charges.) The story was first reported in the Aspen Daily News. Colorado's recreational marijuana stores make history . In fact, the TSA has called the sheriff several times over the past six months to report passengers carrying marijuana and related products, DiSalvo said. His office offers to dispose of the product before passengers depart the state. ""Most everybody heeds our warnings,"" he said. The larger conflict is between state and federal law. While Colorado and Washington allow some marijuana use, federal law hasn't changed. And it's probably not a good idea to test the TSA or other federal agencies at the nation's airports. If they find a substance that violates federal law, they can refer possible violations to federal, state or local law enforcement in any state. Still, pot isn't exactly the TSA's top priority. Denver International Airport bans pot despite Colorado's new marijuana law . ""TSA's focus is on terrorism and security threats to the aircraft and its passengers,"" TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein wrote in a statement. ""TSA's screening procedures, which are governed by federal law, are focused on security and are designed to detect potential threats to aviation and passengers. As has always been the case, if during the security screening procedures an officer discovers an item that may violate the law, TSA refers the matter to law enforcement. Law enforcement officials will determine whether to initiate a criminal investigation."" It can be hard to sort out the competing state and federal regulations, especially for the dazed and confused passenger. The Colorado Springs airport has already placed amnesty boxes for people to get rid of their marijuana before clearing security or getting on an airplane. The Denver International Airport decided not to play with pot, banning the substance entirely at the airport, a spokeswoman confirmed. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport doesn't ban legal amounts of marijuana at the airport. That's because Washington state law doesn't allow facilities to add any additional regulation, airport spokesperson Perry Cooper said. A word of caution to Super Bowl fans from Colorado and Washington: Don't try to take your marijuana to less pot-friendly states. We know your (possible) cannabis consumption won't get in the way of the game, but consider where the Super Bowl is being played. If your pot makes it to your destination, you could be dealing with the Port Authority of New York and police guarding Kennedy and LaGuardia airports in New York and Newark airport in New Jersey. How do you think will they react if your goods are discovered? ""If they're possessing contraband in New York or New Jersey,"" Port Authority spokesman Joe Pentangelo said, ""the prevailing laws would apply.""

"The ""respectful relationship"" curriculum will be mandatory in all schools in Victoria from next year.
Students will explore issues around social inequality, gender-based violence and male privilege.
However, a report on a 2015 pilot trial accused it of presenting all men as ""bad"" and all women as ""victims"".
Pay inequality, anger management, sexual orientation and the dangers of pornography will be among the topics explored by students in the programme, costing A$21.8m (£13.5m; $16.5m).
Primary school students will be exposed to images of both boys and girls doing household chores, playing sport and working as firefighters and receptionists.
The material includes statements including ""girls can play football, can be doctors and can be strong"" and ""boys can cry when they are hurt, can be gentle, can be nurses and can mind babies"".
In high school, students will be taught the meaning of terms including pansexual, cisgender and transsexual and the concept of male privilege.
A guide for the Year 7 and 8 curriculum states: ""Being born a male, you have advantages - such as being overly represented in the public sphere - and this will be true whether you personally approve or think you are entitled to this privilege.""
It describes privilege as ""automatic, unearned benefits bestowed upon dominant groups"" based on ""gender, sexuality, race or socio-economic class"".
Year 11 and 12 students are introduced to the concept of ""hegemonic masculinity"" which ""requires boys and men to be heterosexual, tough, athletic and emotionless, and encourages the control and dominance of men over women"".
Some critics have suggested that although more needs to be done to protect the female victims of domestic violence, the programme lacks objectivity and nuance.
Jeremy Sammut, a senior research fellow at the Centre for Independent Studies, a libertarian think tank, told The Australian newspaper that it amounted to ""taxpayer-funded indoctrination"" of children.
""The idea behind this programme - that all men are latent abusers by nature of the 'discourse' - is an idea that only cloistered feminist academics could love,"" Dr Sammut said.
""A lot of evidence suggests that like child abuse, domestic violence is a by-product of social dysfunction: welfare, drugs, family breakdown.""
The royal commission that recommended education as the key measure for preventing future family violence found that 25% of victims of family violence are men. Critics argue that point is often overlooked.
Education Minister James Merlino has said education is the key to ending the ""vicious cycle"" of family violence.
""This is about teaching our kids to treat everyone with respect and dignity so we can start the cultural change we need in our society to end the scourge of family violence,"" he said.",A state in Australia has launched an education programme designed to smash gender stereotypes and tackle the root causes of domestic violence.

'It was chucking it down with rain and Fergie pulled me aside and said “do me a favour, call the game off’,"" Gallagher told Sportlobster TV. 'I asked why and he said “there’s nowhere else to fit this game in and the Premier League will have to extend the season. We’ll have a better chance of winning the match and we’ll win the league at Old Trafford”. 'At half time United were losing 3-1 and the pitch was like a swimming pool. As we came off he said “I know we’re 3-1 down but please call it off, we could do with a hand here”. 'They managed to pull it back to 3-3 and in the last minute Dennis Irwin ran into the box and went down in front of the Stretford End and I only gave a goal kick. 'At full-time Fergie sprinted across the pitch and shouted at me furiously. My wife said, “Fergie had a right go at you about that penalty didn’t he”. Call it off?

'I told her he hadn’t mentioned the penalty. She asked why he came tearing across the pitch at me then. The truth is he ran over and asked me if I was going out to dinner that night. I said “no” and he asked “why are we leaving so early then?”.' Indeed, Ferguson's ability to squeeze every last second out of officials when his side were losing has since been highlighted.

Without releasing exact details, the 38-year-old took aim at Forest owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi and called on the Football League to take action. It is believed Forest could become subject to a total transfer embargo – banning even loan signings once the window for such moves re-opens next week. Forest are currently barred only from bringing in permanent transfers as part of their punishment for financial fair play breaches. Writing on Twitter late last night, MacAnthony said: '(sic) Ok Posh fans, there wont be any incoming signings today but that has nothing to do with players having to leave etc, the real reason is due - To a certain championship club failing to make an agreed large payment (not thousands btw) last week on plyr they bought from us.

The research shows that poor quality or inadequate sleep can effect many different aspects of skin cells . It is well known that sleep is essential for health, with lack of shuteye associated with everything from weight gain to cancer. But now research has proven the long suspected link between insufficient sleep and accelerated signs of ageing. The study, conducted by University Hospital Case Medical Centre in Ohio investigated  the impact of chronic lack of sleep has on skin function and appearance. They found that poor quality sleepers lost 30 per cent more water 72 hours after a skin barrier disruption, such as exposure to UV light than those who regularly have good quality sleep. Crucially for women concerned with the signs of ageing poor sleepers had twice the amount of intrinsic signs of ageing such as fine lines, reduced elasticity and uneven pigmentation, as well as recovering slower from sunburn. They also reported less satisfaction with their skin's appearance and had a dulled skin sensory response. Further breakthroughs for the importance of night time repair of skin comes from cutting edge research from scientists on the process of Catabolysis. Dr Nadine Pernodet, ‎Executive Director of Skin Biology Research at Estee Lauder explains: 'Catabolysis is a natural purification process that helps skin cells eliminate internal debris that can cause cellular damage.' It is getting older coupled with environmental stressors that generate this internal debris within cells, which can cause cellular damage and prevent cells from functioning effectively. Sleep is essential to skin repair which keeps it looking youthful and even . Skin cells, like the entire human body, have a natural 24 hour rhythm, repairing themselves at night and protecting themselves in the day. The research, commissioned by skincare brand Estée  Lauder, is the first to show that Catabolysis is at its peak at night in line with the circadian rhythm of our bodies and that as you age, the process becomes less efficient and desynchronised with the night. Healthy skin cells maximise natural repair at night and thus suffering from chronic lack of sleep will negatively effect your skin. Sleep expert Dr Guy Meadows from www.thesleepschool.org debunks some myths ... How much sleep do you actually need need? The average amount of sleep people need to wake up feeling refreshed and to cope during the day is 7-8 hours. Genetic variation means that their are long and short sleepers and so sleep needs can range from 4 to 10 hours. Genetics also determine the time that you sleep such as whether you are an owl or a lark. Women are three times more likely to suffer from poor sleep than men (75 to 25 per cent). Can you train yourself to have less sleep? Contrary to what many people believe you cannot train yourself to need less sleep. People who believe they need more sleep than they actually do and spend to long in bed could be weakening their sleep quality. For these people, paradoxically decreasing the amount of hours spent in bed could help to improve depth and quality of sleep. What are long-term effects of not enough sleep? Research tells us that good sleep helps to protect your immune system and prevent you from getting coughs and colds. It helps you to eat healthily and lose weight by regulating the hormones that control appetite. It also regulates your daytime mood and so helps you to combat feelings of stress, anxiety and depression more effectively. Good quality sleep is also the answer to youthful looking skin by lessening the formation of wrinkles and preventing acne. In the long term, good quality sleep has been shown to limit your risk of conditions such as heart failure, Alzheimer's, diabetes and cancer. The fear of not sleeping drives us to stop living our lives such as avoiding going out at night with friends or sleeping in the spare room . What are your top tips for the perfect sleep? 1. Let go of the props – sleep is a natural physiological process that can’t be controlled and trying to do so by engaging in unnatural rituals or becoming reliant on props (e.g. warm baths and milk etc) can lead to further sleep anxiety. Follow a normal wind down of turning of the TV, getting ready for the next day, brushing your teeth, washing your face, reading in bed if you want to and then turning out the light. To achieve your best nights sleep you should limit alcohol consumption, especially close to bedtime . 2. Be mindful – Worrying about past poor quality sleep or imagining how bad things will be in the future if we don’t sleep only helps to increase night time arousal levels. Mindfulness grounds us in the present moment by noticing things objectively and without judgment and as a result can promote sleepiness. Take a moment to notice the touch or your pillow on your face or the movement of your breath and if your mind wanders off, gently return it back to what you were observing in that moment.  3. Welcome thoughts and emotions – fearful thoughts such as 'If I don’t sleep, I wont be able to cope' or strong sensations such as anxiety or a racing heart, are a common aspect of insomnia. However, it is often our unhelpful attempts to avoid them such as watching TV or drinking alcohol in the middle of the night that actually keep us awake and fuel them further. Learning to change your relationship with them by getting to know them and even welcoming them when they arrive, helps to reduce their power over you and lessen your struggle with sleep.4. Timing and drive – when we can’t sleep we try to catch up by going to bed earlier, lying in or napping for long periods during the day. Whilst this may help you to cope in the short term, it often leads to a weaker sleep wake cycle. Start to go to bed and get up at ‘roughly’ the same time most nights, as this will help to keep your body clock on time and promote the natural drive to sleep. If you fancy a nap, then limit it too less than 20 minutes.5. The Bedroom – if you are awake at night choose to stay in bed and conserve your energy by lying still and being calm and relaxed. Be mindful and welcome your thoughts and emotions. The key is learning how to be in bed with all of your fears, rather than spending all night struggling with them or getting out of bed to avoid them.6. Live your life – the fear of not sleeping drives us to stop living our lives such as avoiding going out at night with friends or sleeping in the spare room. Commit to making small actions everyday that take you closer to what is important to you in your life, whilst experiencing your insomnia. Doing so takes away the justification for struggling with sleep in the first place and paradoxically promotes sleep.  7. Lifestyle and environment – Live a healthy lifestyle that promotes sleep. For example, drink a moderate amount of caffeine and stop by 2pm. Limit alcohol consumption, especially close to bedtime. Exercise regularly during the day or early evening and for the reasons of enjoyment and health promotion, rather than to get you to sleep. Sleep in a cool, quiet and dark room. Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex II claims to clean out dirt or dead skin cells from deep in your skin while you sleep . Estée Lauder have used this research into the importance of sleep in skin cell repair to develop an industry first anti-ageing product. Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery . Complex II works to aid the process of Catabolysis at night, resulting in younger looking skin with long-term use. The patented Catabolysis Technology contains algae and yeast extract to support the skins purifying process and Chronolux Technology which helps support the natural synchronization of the skins nighttime renewal process. The serum is applied before bed and washed off in the morning. Estée Lauder's iconic original Advanced Night Repair has been one of the best-selling anti-ageing products for the past 25 years and one of the first products to harness the fact that the skin repairs itself at night. The Daily Mail's Beauty Editor Elsa McAlonan was one of the first industry experts to try the £48 serum ahead of it going on sale next week, she said: 'The product is supposed to slow down the look of premature ageing, dramatically reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and improve the appearance of radiance and evenness. 'In tests, 83 per cent of women felt their skin looked healthier, and found it gave them a fresher, more rested look. Don't expect to look ten years younger after one night, but you should see a difference after a week.'","Catabolysis is a purification process for skin cells .

"You don't get invited out on a US nuclear aircraft carrier all that often, and after writing this I might not get invited back for a while.
On the flight deck of the USS George Washington the noise is like nothing I've ever experienced. A few feet from where I am standing, 11 F/A-18 Super Hornets are lining up to be launched.
The first one is hooked on to the catapult; there is a massive crescendo as its engines roar to full re-heat. Then, in a cloud of white steam, the 15-tonne jet is thrown down the deck and off the end of the ship like a toy.
Seconds later, the deck crew in their multi-coloured smocks are calmly lining up the next one.
Watching the US Navy close up like this, it is hard not to be slightly awed. No other navy in the world has quite the same toys, or shows them off with the same easy charm.
But as I stand on the deck filming my report on how ""the US is practising for war with China"", I can see my host from the Navy public affairs office wincing.
You get used to hearing the PR rhetoric: the US Navy ""is not practising for war with any specific country"". But the US Navy has not assembled two whole carrier battle groups and 200 aircraft off the coast of Guam for a jolly, either. This is about practising what the Pentagon now calls ""Air Sea Battle"".
It is a concept first put forward in 2009, and it is specifically designed to counter the rising threat from China.
A few minutes later I am standing on the bridge of the George Washington with Rear Adm Mark Montgomery, the commander of Carrier Strike Group Five. The forces under his command are practising for what he calls an ""anti-access, area denial"" scenario.
""When we talk about our capabilities,"" he says, ""we are talking about our capabilities to operate in unrestricted way in the waters of our choice"".
""As some countries have been developing increasingly complex anti-access weapons, we have to develop our tactics, techniques and procedures to continue to operate in an unfettered manner.""
Rear Adm Montgomery won't discuss the specifics of the exercise. But his ships and aircraft face an increasingly complex web of threats, from beneath the water, from air, land, from cyberspace and from space.
""It's generally understood that some countries have the ability to remove satellites or to limit satellite communications,"" he says, ""so we have to practise working in a communications-denied environment.""
China's People's Liberation Army Navy is still no match for the US Navy, and won't be for a very long time. Instead, China has been developing other weapons designed to keep America's precious carriers far away from China's shores.
These include new quieter submarines, long-range hypersonic anti-ship missiles and, perhaps most worrying, very accurate medium range ballistic missiles that have been dubbed ""carrier killers"".
As if on cue, an alarm bell starts ringing. A voice comes on the public address system:
""This is a drill, this is a drill! Black smoke, black smoke!""
The George Washington is under simulated attack. Part of the ship is reported to be on fire. Teams rush to contain the damage.
For the last 10 years, China's most important, and oft-repeated, political slogan has been ""peaceful rise"". It is designed to reassure Beijing's neighbours its growing military might is no threat.
But since President Xi Jinping came to power last year, there has been a distinct change. China is now asserting claims well beyond its own coastline.
Its ships are aggressively patrolling the Senkaku, or Diaoyu, islands in the East China Sea, long controlled by Japan. It is spending billions building new islands in the South China Sea.

Senkaku/Diaoyu islands
How uninhabited islands soured China-Japan ties
In August a Chinese fighter jet confronted a US surveillance plane in international airspace over the South China Sea, repeatedly buzzing it and, according to the US Navy, closing to within 20ft (6m).
According to Rear Adm Montgomery, all this makes the US Navy's role in the region even more vital.
""The US Navy is one of the single greatest contributors to the security and stability of the Asia Pacific region,"" he says. ""We have been for nearly 70 years"".
""I think the US Navy plays a good role whether it is in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, the Philippine Sea, stabilising things, assuring partners and dissuading adversaries from taking actions that are non-transparent or illegal.""
China's leaders would no doubt disagree. Beijing's long-term aim is to dominate the waters close to its shores. If the US Navy tries to stop it, might that not make conflict more likely?
But from Tokyo to Taipei, Manila to Hanoi, there are governments that are very happy to see America's great carrier battle groups sailing these waters.","The US prefers to talk about engaging with China, but it is clear its navy is now also practising for a potential conflict, reports the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes."

"Wuhan, China (CNN) -- Professor Kou Zhangbing conducts a health check. He tenderly calls the patient over with a tap of his hand, checks tongue and teeth for injuries, eyes for mood, and skin for scratches. As a treat, he hands out a salted fish. ""The most important thing we can do is to keep them healthy,"" he says. Kou is one of a handful of Chinese scientists trying to save the finless porpoise, a freshwater species found in the Yangtze River. Rarer than China's giant panda, this famed species now teeters on the brink of extinction. Recent surveys suggest that there are a mere thousand animals left, down dramatically from similar surveys conducted just six years ago. ""If proper measures aren't taken they will be extinct in 10 years, but to be honest, we only have five years to take action,"" said Zhang Xinqiao of the World Wildlife Fund. Professor Kou and his colleagues research the rare mammal in a series of deep blue pools at the Institute for Hydrobiology in Wuhan. They are trying to understand these curious creatures and possibly breed them for the wild. ""I spend more time with them than with my family,"" said Kou, ""They have become an indispensable part of my life."" It's mating season, so they dance underwater and act a little strange. Occasionally, a porpoise swims right up to the viewing glass and all but presses its face against it. The porpoise's face is set in a permanent quizzical smile. Dark and forward-facing eyes carefully monitor the movements of its visitors. Porpoises are smaller and stouter than their dolphin cousins; they have shorter beaks, and live in smaller groups. Those groups could be getting even smaller in the wild. Asia's longest river is also one of its most polluted. Scientists estimate that about 800 million tons of wastewater is dumped into the Yangtze every year. Pollution, overfishing, and intensive development on the Yangtze have all combined to push the porpoise near extinction. ""All of these human activities have destroyed the natural habitat of the finless porpoise, taking away their food supply and even injuring and killing them directly,"" said Zhang. He said the prospect of survival in the Yangtze is bleak, but he clings onto hope for the species. That hope, such as there is, can be found West of Wuhan in Tian-e-Zhou oxbow lake. Once part of the Yangtze, the lake was formed from a bend in the river and then separated from the main stream. ""This is the best chance we have to keep the species alive,"" said Gao Daobin, an official in charge of the park. ""We only have this animal in China and kids will start asking questions when they learn about it. They will ask 'why did it go extinct?'"" It's no idle fear. The Baiji dolphin, a regal animal with its trademark pointed beak, went functionally extinct in the Yangtze in 2006. Scientists believe there may be individual animals in the murky water, but it could never sustain the species. So the finless porpoise is the last remaining freshwater cetacean left in China. Gao shows us a breeding pen separated from the lake by just a net. A handler drops individual fish into the mouth of the captive porpoises. They have to make sure to give exactly the right nutrients. They will be released into the lake, where the fewer than 40 porpoises could represent their last stand. ""Nobody cared about them in the past, but attitudes are changing. Now, if they go extinct, all of our years of work will be meaningless,"" said Gao.","Researchers in China are working to protect the finless porpoise from extinction .
They're stouter than their dolphin cousins and rarer than China's giant panda .

"Chingola, Zambia (CNN) -- It's 10 minutes after the final whistle has blown but still no one knows whether their efforts have been in vain. The Libyan national soccer team sit in the dressing room at the Nchanga Stadium -- in Chingola, a small copper mining town on the Zambia-Congo border -- quietly waiting for news amidst the fog of sweat and redolence of rubefacient muscle rub. The team has just drawn 0-0 with Zambia in their final qualification match for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, a qualification campaign that began with the country under the rule of Colonel Moammar Gadhafi, continued through the civil war and ended before the death of the former notorious leader. Victory was needed to be sure of progression to next January's tournament in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. A draw meant that results elsewhere had to go their way. As their campaign for Africa's biennial continental championship progressed with war as the backdrop, some players declared the team was behind Gadhafi. Others left the team to go and fight on the front line with the rebels. In unison, somehow, they qualified; news that will shortly be relayed to the team when confirmation of results from other matches are circulated. Six days earlier coach Marcos Paqueta is in good spirits in the lobby of his hotel in Tunis. The security situation is such that the team could not train in Tripoli. The Brazilian coach once famously won the under 17s and under 20s World Cups in the same year for his homeland, but signed for Libya in June 2010 when the Libyan Football Federation was run by one of Gadhafi's sons, Mohamed. ""When I was there the first time I contacted only the federation, then one time I have one meeting with Dr Mohamed,"" Paqueta explains of his dealings with the Gadhafi regime. ""He was happy because of the project I made for the national team and Libyan football. I focus only on sports. At that time you don't know about the country."" In the past, the Gadhafi family's dealings with soccer and its players had been much more hands on. His son Saadi played for Al Ahly Tripoli and installed himself as captain of the national team. The team plummeted to 186th on FIFA's rankings. But they also used soccer as a political tool. In 2000 Saadi's Al Ahly Tripoli traveled to Al Ahly Benghazi for a league match. Benghazi had long been associated with Libya's opposition and the team's fans paraded a donkey wearing Saadi's shirt. ""It is a bad story, not a funny story,"" says 29-year-old defensive midfielder Moataz Ben Amer, the current captain of Al Ahly Benghazi. ""The first half, Tripoli are winning. But the referee is no good. So Ahly Benghazi goes to the airport [in protest]. Saadi Gadhafi turned up with his dogs and the police and said: 'If you don't play the second half, we will kick you'."" Unsurprisingly, the players returned to play the second half, and lost 3-0. Colonel Gadhafi was so incensed that he ordered Al Ahly Benghazi's training ground to be destroyed. The club was also banned from domestic competition for five years. When Interpol released a ""Red Notice"" for Saadi Gadhafi in September, the allegations given were ""misappropriating properties through force and armed intimidation when he headed the Libyan Football Federation."" Paqueta's early results were encouraging. Libya beat Zambia, one of Africa's best teams, in Tripoli. But then in February civil war broke out, dividing the players. After Libya had beaten the Comoros Islands in March the team's former captain, 34-year-old Tariq Taib, declared that the players were 100 per cent behind Gadhafi. He even labeled the rebels ""rats and dogs."" Walid el Kahatroushi disagreed. The 27-year-old midfielder scored in that game but when the team gathered again in June, he decided to leave the camp and fight for the rebels when he heard a friend had been injured in the violence. ""Some people come to me and told me one of my dear friends was in the hospital and lost his arm ... in that moment I decided to leave the camp and join the front line ... in Jebel Nafousa,"" explains Kahatroushi. Life on the front line was hard. Friends would shield him from worst of the fighting until, in the end, he felt he had no choice . ""When I was there I was just about forgetting about football because the most important thing then is how to secure your life and secure the life of your friends. If it was about me I would never come back, you would never find me here playing football. But ... my friends on the front line told me: 'This is your future, you must go there. This is also like a war for you'."" Others left for the front line too, like goalkeeper Guma Mousa, but not all were so lucky. Ahmed Alsagir was shot in the shoulder and spent a month in hospital before returning to the front line. By the end of August Gadhafi had been toppled. A week later the team had to play their penultimate qualifier against Mozambique behind closed doors in Egypt. Aside from the trouble of getting the players out of the country, there were some more practical concerns. For one, Paqueta had to hold a clear the air meeting with the squad. The old pro-Gaddafi players were nowhere to be seen. A new kit had to be designed, with the rebel's flag stitched on to it. The Libyans fought out a 0-0 draw. ""The last game [against] Mozambique, it had a big impact on the people in Libya. Everyone was happy and everyone was talking about us,"" recalls Kahatroushi. ""We will do everything to qualify, Inshallah, because this will help our country too much. At least to bring them some happiness after all the sadness they have been through."" The journey south to Zambia took almost 24 hours, but the players are ready when they take to the pitch at the packed Nchanga Stadium. Libya's new captain, 39-year-old goalkeeper Samir Abod is the hero, making three world class saves. The match finishes 0-0. Some of the players collapse on the floor in tears. Others pray before returning to the dressing room. They wait. The quiet is broken when one of the coaches bursts in and breathlessly delivers the news. The blue-painted room erupts in celebration and song. The rebel national anthem is sung as the new flag is held aloft in the center of the melee. Ghana's victory and a last-minute equalizer for Guinea against Nigeria means that Libya has, against the odds, qualified for the Nations Cup. As a nation recovers thousands of miles away from the ravages of civil war under the new interim government, Walid Kahatroushi leads the celebrations and the chants. ""The blood of the dead,"" they sing, ""will not be spilt in vain.""","CNN travels with the Libyan national soccer team to Zambia .

An analysis of a rock sample collected by the rover found key chemical ingredients. 'We have found a habitable environment that is so benign and supportive of life, that probably if this water was around and you had been there, you would have been able to drink it,' said John Grotzinger, Curiosity's project scientist. Scroll down for video . This powered rock that shows there may once have been life on Mars: Analysis of a rock sample collected by the curiosity rover found key chemical ingredients for life, Nasa said today . Curiosity made the assessment after . studying a powdered sample drilled from a fine-grained rock at its . exploration site in Gale Crater, a deep impact bowl on Mars' equator. The rock was analysed in two of the rovers onboard chemistry labs:  Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) and . Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instruments. 'A fundamental question for this mission . is whether Mars could have supported a habitable environment,' said . Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program at the . agency's headquarters in Washington. 'From what we know now, the answer . is yes.' The groundbreaking analysis by the chemical lab onboard the Curiosity rover shows ancient Mars could have supported living microbes. Scientists identified sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon - some of the key chemical ingredients for life - in the powder Curiosity drilled out of a sedimentary rock near an ancient stream bed in Gale Crater on the Red Planet last month. Clues to this habitable environment come from data returned by the rover's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) and Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instruments. The data indicated the Yellowknife Bay area the rover is exploring was the end of an ancient river system or an intermittently wet lake bed that could have provided chemical energy and other favorable conditions for microbes. The rock is made up of a fine-grained mudstone containing clay minerals, sulfate minerals and other chemicals. This ancient wet environment, unlike some others on Mars, was not harshly oxidizing, acidic or extremely salty. The patch of bedrock where Curiosity drilled for its first sample lies in an ancient network of stream channels descending from the rim of Gale Crater. The bedrock also is fine-grained mudstone and shows evidence of multiple periods of wet conditions, including nodules and veins. a self-portrait of Curiosity at the drilling site where the discovery was made . This set of images shows the different types of rocks seen by NASA's Opportunity rover and Curiosity rover at two different parts of Mars. On the left is 'Wopmay' rock, in Endurance Crater, Meridiani Planum, as studied by the Opportunity rover. On the right are the rocks of the 'Sheepbed' unit in Yellowknife Bay, in Gale Crater, as seen by Curiosity. Curiosity's drill collected the sample at a site just a few hundred yards away from where the rover earlier found an ancient streambed in September 2012. 'Clay minerals make up at least 20 percent of the composition of this sample,' said David Blake, principal investigator for the CheMin instrument at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. These clay minerals are a product of the reaction of relatively fresh water with igneous minerals, such as olivine, also present in the sediment, Nasa said. The reaction could have taken place within the sedimentary deposit, during transport of the sediment, or in the source region of the sediment. The presence of calcium sulfate along with the clay suggests the soil is neutral or mildly alkaline. Scientists were surprised to find a mixture of oxidized, less-oxidized, and even non-oxidized chemicals, providing an energy gradient of the sort many microbes on Earth exploit to live. This partial oxidation was first hinted at when the drill cuttings were revealed to be gray rather than red. This side-by-side comparison shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of two different samples collected from the Martian surface by NASA's Curiosity rover. The Rocknest reading (left) suggests a dry, aeolian (wind-shaped) environment with low water activity. The John Klein pattern (right) suggests a lacustrine (lakebed) environment with high water activity. This full-resolution image from NASA's Curiosity shows the turret of tools at the end of the rover's extended robotic arm on Aug. 20, 2012 . 'The range of chemical ingredients we have identified in the sample is impressive, and it suggests pairings such as sulfates and sulfides that indicate a possible chemical energy source for micro-organisms,' said Paul Mahaffy, principal investigator of the SAM suite of instruments at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. An additional drilled sample will be used to help confirm these results for several of the trace gases analyzed by the SAM instrument. 'We have characterized a very ancient, but strangely new 'gray Mars' where conditions once were favorable for life,' said John Grotzinger, Mars Science Laboratory project scientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif. This false-color map shows the area within Gale Crater on Mars, where NASA's Curiosity rover landed on Aug. 5, and the location where Curiosity collected its first drilled sample at the 'John Klein' rock . 'Curiosity is on a mission of discovery and exploration, and as a team we feel there are many more exciting discoveries ahead of us in the months and years to come.' Scientists now plan to work with Curiosity in the 'Yellowknife Bay' area for many more weeks before beginning a long drive to Gale Crater's central mound, Mount Sharp. Investigating the stack of layers exposed on Mount Sharp, where clay minerals and sulfate minerals have been identified from orbit, may add information about the duration and diversity of habitable conditions.","Groundbreaking analysis by the chemical lab onboard the Curiosity rover shows ancient Mars could have supported living microbes .

"By . Tracey Cox . It's National Orgasm Day, don't you know? Well, if you didn't know one thing you will be sure of (especially if you're female) is that reaching that magical point during sex isn't always so easy. For many, there's no problem but for plenty of women there can be obstacles in the way of reaching climax. Fear not though because there are ways to make sure that love making isn't boring and offers as much fun for you as it does your partner. Here's Sexpert Tracey Cox's tips for helping yourself out in the bedroom. Don't be miserable in the bedroom: Help yourself to orgasm by reading up on Tracey's top tips . Change your attitude . The most common obstacle to having an orgasm is your attitude to sex. If you’ve been brought up to believe it’s ‘bad’ or ‘dirty’ or even ‘unladylike’, you probably feel uncomfortable touching yourself or letting your partner touch you. The ‘good girls don’t’ inhibition factor is a big problem for some. Remember that sex and pleasure is normal and allow yourself to get carried away. Enjoy! If you really can't, do think about booking a few sessions with a female sex therapist (check out the Psychological Society) Accept you have to learn how to orgasm . Female orgasms aren’t automatic. You’re . not going to accidentally have one while doing the ironing. It’s also . extremely unlikely that you’ll have your first orgasm with a partner. Practically all women have their first on their own. So if you’re . waiting for some magical lover to transport you to heaven, stock up the . cupboards – you’re in for an awfully long wait. Instead, invest in a few . good sex books that focus specifically on the emotional barriers to . orgasm. Keep reading and researching until you feel good about sex, . confident that you understand how your body works and know the basic . techniques most women use to orgasm. Accept responsibility for your own pleasure . Do you think it’s his responsibility to ‘give’ you an orgasm?  No-one can ‘give’ you an orgasm; you have to ‘take’ one yourself, by guiding and telling him how to do it. It’s not like a five-course meal where he slaves in the kitchen and you get to do nothing but lie about until you’re ready to savour the results. Orgasms happen when both of you know what you want and how to get it. Teach yourself how to masturbate . You’ll learn more about your body and its response system if you use your fingers but using a vibrator is also a good idea. Any good department store sells personal massagers, ostensibly designed to massage shoulders but more often bought to massage clitorises. The saleswoman won’t know what you’re buying it for. Remember though, you’re not putting it inside but holding it against your sensitive parts. Also do teach yourself to climax using your hands. Unless you want to always use a vibrator with your partner, you need to know how to do it manually. Teach him how to do it . Once you’ve masturbated yourself to orgasm, it’s time to tell him how to do it otherwise how is he supposed to know what you like? God sex is your own responsibility - don't expect to be able to lie back and let your partner do all the work . Change how you see your own body . Many women don’t orgasm because they think their partners can’t possibly find them attractive and spend too much time thinking about that during sex, rather than focusing on what's going on. Let’s get one thing straight right now: an overwhelming majority of men are turned on by a naked woman’s body, no matter what shape it’s in. However, if you aren’t happy with yours, do something about it. Join a gym, get a make-over, eat healthily, then splash out on some new clothes. But accept what nature has handed out: ignore the faults, play up the good bits and learn to love every centimetre. Stop trying so hard . A watched pot never boils. Your mind should be focused on how pleasurable the sensations are, not on ‘Please God, let me have one’. The more you worry about it, the more your body will tense and make orgasm impossible. Try a bit of reverse psychology. When you masturbate or make love, tell yourself you’re not allowed to have an orgasm, that this session is strictly for ‘research’ purposes. You’ll relax more and may well end up scoring a goal. Tracey Cox knows it all when it comes to sex . Rethink your relationship . ‘You’re fat’, ‘No wonder you can’t have an orgasm, you’re no good at anything’, ‘You’re not a real woman’, ‘You’re frigid’ – if your partner says or insinuates negative things about you, your body or your inability to climax, getting rid of him is the simple solution to your problem. Tracey . has an academic background in psychology, has written 14 books on sex, . relationships and body language and has hosted many TV shows on these . topics across her career to date.

"(CNN) -- The government shutdown is in its second week, and the public debate in the United States is centered around how the crisis will be resolved and who is to blame. What do the polls say? What are the implications for the Republican Party, for House Speaker John Boehner and President Barack Obama? Not many are talking about the international implications. But they could be significant. Many in the international community have argued the U.S. government is dysfunctional or even broken. Friends are questioning whether America can be relied on or whether partisan politics will prevent it from acting when called upon. And with this comes some fear. America's adversaries may come to believe that they can act without consequence -- that America will, in the end, trip over itself. These perceptions are extremely dangerous, both for the United States and the rest of the world. They will limit American deterrence and weaken America's partnerships as friends and allies start to wonder whether the United States has their back. America has long been critiqued internationally both for doing too much and too little. In a study Chatham House is conducting on elite perceptions of the United States, many in Europe cast aspersions on the United States for its actions in Iraq and Afghanistan (wars into which the U.S. pulled others) or its use of drones. They also condemn America's perceived lack of leadership in Syria. They want Washington to act but cannot agree how. It is a no-win situation for America. One thing they are clear on: Europeans (and others, particularly in Asia) want a strong United States. One that provides moral leadership and enforces global norms. One that can be called upon to act, particularly in tough situations. Instead, events in recent weeks have only reinforced the international perception that America is in decline. The ""declinist"" debate has been raging for years, driven in large part by America's diminishing percentage of global gross domestic product (as against China's rise in particular). However, with the recent economic recovery, such views were wavering, and the strength of U.S. innovation, entrepreneurship and technology, coming on top of the energy revolution, were persuading some that the United States was once again on the rise. In recent weeks however, these arguments have been overcome by the pictures of gridlock and weakness in Washington. First it was the story that Obama was ""saved"" by Russian President Vladimir Putin from an embarrassing loss in a congressional vote to attack Syria over its suspected use of chemical weapons. Then came the shutdown. And, for those in the private sector in particular, a developing fear that, come October 17, when the United States needs to raise its debt ceiling, it will instead drive itself and the world's economy off a cliff. The idea of America as a secure, stable, predictable state, where investment cannot fail to be reimbursed, would suffer a significant blow. Holders of Treasury bonds would no longer be assured of their returns. Chinese efforts to weaken the position of the dollar as the only reserve currency would get a boost. Investors would no longer have the gold-standard U.S. guarantee. But while perceptions are extremely important, they are not reality. As Sunday's anti-terrorist operations in Somalia and Libya show, America will act when it wants to. While the U.S. Treasury bond may seem less secure, it is still far stronger and better guaranteed than that of any other large economy. A nation moves when its interests, capabilities and will are engaged. America's interests have not changed. Its capabilities are still vastly superior to those of most other nations.

"Rage (written as Getting It On; the title was changed before publication) is a psychological thriller novel by American writer Stephen King, the first he published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. It was first published in 1977 and then was collected in 1985 in the hardcover omnibus The Bachman Books. The novel describes a school shooting, and has been associated with actual high school shooting incidents in the 1980s and 1990s. In response King allowed the novel to fall out of print, and in 2013 he published a non-fiction, anti-firearms violence essay titled ""Guns"". 
  
 Plot summary [ edit ] 
  
 Charlie Decker, a Maine high school senior, is called to a meeting with his principal about a previous incident in which he struck his chemistry teacher with a pipe wrench, leading to the teacher's hospitalization and Charlie's suspension. For unknown reasons, Charlie subjects the principal to a series of insulting remarks, resulting in his expulsion. Charlie storms out of the office and retrieves a pistol from his locker, then sets the contents of his locker on fire. He then returns to his classroom and fatally shoots his algebra teacher, Miss Jean Underwood. The fire triggers an alarm, but Charlie forces his classmates to stay in the room, killing a history teacher, Mr Peter Vance, when he attempts to enter. As the other students and teachers evacuate the school, the police and media arrive at the scene. 
  
 Over the following four hours, Charlie toys with various authority figures who attempt to negotiate with him, including the principal, the school psychologist, and the local police chief. Charlie gives them certain commands, threatening to kill students if they do not comply. Charlie also admits to his hostages that he does not know what has compelled him to commit his deeds, believing he will regret them when the situation is over. As his fellow students start identifying with Charlie, he unwittingly turns his class into a sort of psychotherapy group, causing his schoolmates to semi-voluntarily tell embarrassing secrets regarding themselves and each other. 
  
 Interspersed throughout are narrative flashbacks to Charlie's troubled childhood, particularly his tumultuous relationship with his abusive father Carl. Several notable incidents include a violent disagreement between two female students and a police sniper's attempt to shoot Charlie through the heart. However, Charlie survives due to the bullet's striking his locker's combination lock, which he had earlier placed in the breast pocket of his shirt. 
  
 Charlie finally comes to the realization that only one student is really being held against his will: a seeming ""Big Man On Campus"" named Ted Jones, who is harboring his own secrets. Ted realizes this and attempts to escape the classroom, but the other students brutally assault him, driving him into a battered catatonic state. At 1:00 p.m., Charlie releases the students, but Ted is unable to move under his own power and remains. When the police chief enters the classroom, the now-unarmed Charlie moves as if to shoot him, attempting suicide by cop. The chief shoots Charlie, but he survives and is found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to a psychiatric hospital in Augusta, Maine until he can answer for his actions. 
  
 The final chapters contain an inter-office memo concerning Ted's treatment and prognosis at the hospital where he is now a patient, and a letter from one of Charlie's friends describing assorted developments in the students' lives during the months following this incident. The story ends with Charlie addressing the reader: ""That's the end. I have to turn off the light now. Good night."" 
  
 Connections to actual school shootings [ edit ] 
  
 The novel's plot vaguely resembles actual events that have transpired since the book's publication, to such a degree that the author is no longer comfortable with the book's being in print for fear that it may inspire similar occurrences (""[Rage is] now out of print.""[1]) as it had already been associated with incidents of high school shootings and hostage takings: 
  
 Jeffrey Lyne Cox, a senior at San Gabriel High School in San Gabriel, California, took a semi-automatic rifle to school on April 26, 1988, and held a humanities class of about 60 students hostage for over 30 minutes. Cox held the gun to one student when the teacher doubted Cox would cause harm and stated that he would prove it to her. At that time three students escaped out a rear door and were fired upon. Cox was later tackled and disarmed by another student. A friend of Cox's told the press that Cox had been inspired by the Kuwait Airways Flight 422 hijacking and by the novel Rage , [2] which Cox had read over and over again and with which he strongly identified. [3] 
  
 , which Cox had read over and over again and with which he strongly identified. Dustin L. Pierce, a senior at Jackson County High School in McKee, Kentucky, armed himself with a shotgun and two handguns and took a history classroom hostage in a nine-hour standoff with police on September 18, 1989, that ended without injury. Police found a copy of Rage among the possessions in Pierce's bedroom, leading to speculation that he had been inspired to carry out the plot of the novel. [4] 
  
 among the possessions in Pierce's bedroom, leading to speculation that he had been inspired to carry out the plot of the novel. On January 18, 1993, Scott Pennington, a student at East Carter High School in Grayson, Kentucky, took a .38-caliber revolver that was owned by his father and fatally shot his English teacher Deanna McDavid in the head, during her seventh period class. He subsequently shot and killed the school's custodian, Marvin Hicks, and held the class hostage for 20 minutes before releasing them. [5] Just before the shootings he had written an essay on the book Rage and was upset that McDavid had given it a C grade. [6] 
  
 Just before the shootings he had written an essay on the book and was upset that McDavid had given it a C grade. Barry Loukaitis, a student at Frontier Middle School in Moses Lake, Washington, walked from his house to the school on February 2, 1996, and entered his algebra classroom during fifth period. He opened fire at students, killing two and wounding another. He then fatally shot his algebra teacher, Leona Caires, in the chest. As his classmates began to panic, Loukaitis reportedly said, ""This sure beats algebra, doesn't it?""—a line erroneously believed to be taken from Rage . (No such line appears in King’s story. The closest is when Charlie Decker quips, ""This sure beats panty raids."") Hearing the gunshots, gym coach Jon Lane entered the classroom. Loukaitis was holding his classmates hostage and planned to use one hostage so he could safely exit the school. Lane volunteered to be the hostage, and Loukaitis kept Lane at gunpoint with his rifle. Lane then grabbed the weapon from Loukaitis, wrestled him to the ground, then assisted the evacuation of students. [7]

Lane then grabbed the weapon from Loukaitis, wrestled him to the ground, then assisted the evacuation of students. In December 1997, Michael Carneal shot eight fellow students at a prayer meeting in West Paducah, Kentucky. He had a copy of Rage within the Richard Bachman omnibus in his locker. This was the incident that moved King to allow the book to go out of print.[8] 
  
 End of publication [ edit ] 
  
 When King decided to let Rage fall out of print in the United States, it remained available only as part of The Bachman Books. In contrast, the other novels that appeared in that compilation - The Long Walk, Roadwork, and The Running Man - are available separately in the USA. Rage remained available in the United Kingdom and other countries in The Bachman Books for a time, but later appeared to become unavailable.[9] New editions of The Bachman Books do not include Rage. 
  
 In a footnote to the preface of the novel Blaze, dated 30 January 2007, King wrote of Rage: ""Now out of print, and a good thing."" 
  
 King said, in his keynote address at the VEMA Annual Meeting on May 26, 1999: ""The Carneal incident was enough for me. I asked my publisher to take the damned thing out of print. They concurred.""[8] King went on to describe his view on this subject, which acknowledged the role that cultural or artistic products such as Rage play in influencing individuals, particularly troubled youths, while also declaring that artists and writers should not be denied the aesthetic opportunity to draw upon their own culture—which is suffused with violence, according to King—in their work.[8] King went on to describe his inspiration for stories such as Rage, which drew heavily upon his own frustrations and pains as a high school student.[8] 
  
 In an article on the ominous writings of Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho for Entertainment Weekly, King said: ""Certainly in this sensitized day and age, my own college writing—including a short story called 'Cain Rose Up' and the novel Rage—would have raised red flags, and I'm certain someone would have tabbed me as mentally ill because of them...""[10] After the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, he elaborated in a non-fiction essay, titled ""Guns"" (2013),[11] on why he let Rage go out of print. King's website states: ""All profits from 'Guns' will benefit the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.""[12] ||||| This is such a visceral, divisive issue in America that even the most rational arguments will fail to sway the other side. King admits he is coming from the left on this one. He knows he is tilting against windmills yet lays out an emotional and cogent case that gun rights are out of control. He provides no new ideas but agrees that certain types of firearms should be restricted, background checks made more rigid, etc. Much of his impetus for writing this essay comes from the influence of one of his books...so good on him for taking responsibility. Responsibility is something lawmakers and the American public need to take or the country will continue to see 80 gun deaths each and every day. ||||| Topics: amazon, Books, Gun Violence, Guns, kindle single, Second Amendment, Entertainment News 
  
 Stephen King has published a Kindle Single (more than a book, less than an essay, proprietary to Amazon platforms) on gun violence, in which he describes his decision to pull his pseudonymous novel “Rage” from shelves after possible copycat crimes. 
  
 “Rage,” which King first wrote in high school (“I suppose if it had been written today, and some high school English teacher had seen it, he would have rushed the manuscript to the guidance counselor and I would have found myself in therapy posthaste”), depicts a hostage situation in a high school when a student brings a weapon to school. 
  
 After a series of similar situations in high schools (including one where, as in the book, a math teacher was killed), King made the costly decision to pull the book from stores. Though “I never did and never would” apologize for the book, he says, the depiction of violence in the book is “a possible accelerant” for troubled young men with access to guns. ||||| Stephen King has published a 99-cent Kindle Single called “Guns,” a short essay about gun violence in America that “constructs his argument for what can and should be done.” 
  
 In the essay, King wrote frankly about Rage, a novel he released under the pen name Richard Bachman about a boy who takes a high school classroom hostage with a gun. 
  
 Four different teenagers cited the book after attacks on their schools and King decided to remove the book from publication. 
  
 He explained in his new Kindle Single: |||||","– Stephen King is jumping into America's conversation on gun violence, with a new Kindle Single entitled simply, ""Guns."" According to Amazon, the 99-cent essay ""constructs his argument for what can and should be done"" to reduce violence. But the segment that's grabbing attention is one in which King talks about his decision to pull his first novel, Rage, from publication, for fear that it might inspire school shooters. Rage depicts a hostage situation in a school, and four teenagers mentioned the book after attacking their schools. In an excerpt from ""Guns"" quoted on MediaBistro, King says the book didn't turn kids into killers—""yet I did see Rage as a possible accelerant, which is why I pulled it from sale. You don’t leave a can of gasoline where a boy with firebug tendencies can lay hands on it."" In general, however, King's essay argues that the culture has little impact on gun violence, Salon reports."
"An online register would include a list of organisations which spend large amounts of cash employing people to influence MSPs.
In 2013, the Scottish government announced plans to legislate on lobbying, but no bill has yet emerged.
Ministers said they remained committed to taking the issue forward.
The cross-party standards committee recommended the register should cover ""significant"" lobbying activity, which would also take in organisations which have sustained contact with politicians.
They would need to provide information on meetings with MSPs, events and hospitality involving MSPs and details of what the lobbying aimed to achieve.
Healthy democracy
Committee convener Stewart Stevenson, an SNP MSP, said: ""Lobbying is a legitimate, valuable and necessary part of a healthy democracy.
""But a parliament founded on openness must seek to make clear who is lobbying, on what issues, and why.""
Plans for a register of lobbyists - originally suggested by Labour MSP Neil Findlay - were put forward in the wake of events at Westminster, after three peers were accused of agreeing to carry out parliamentary work for payment.
The Scottish Parliament has remained free of any serious lobbying scandal, apart from an incident in 1999 when the Observer newspaper reported that public relations firm Beattie Media touted for business by offering privileged access to Scottish ministers.
A Scottish government spokesman welcomed the committee's report, adding: ""We have repeatedly said that the standards committee's inquiry into lobbying is central to determining the best way forward and we will now take the time to carefully consider its findings.
""The Scottish government remains committed to take forward the development of a Lobbying Transparency Bill.""","The names of major political lobbyists in Scotland should be made public to improve transparency, the parliament's standards committee has said."

"An aid worker battling the deadly and fast-spreading Ebola virus in West Africa said the area is completely unprepared to deal with the crisis. Ali Readhead, originally from Perth in Western Australia, has been living in Sierra Leone for the past two years and has seen first hand the devastation the disease is causing. 'It's chaos', she told Daily Mail Australia. 'They're totally under-resourced.' 'Patients are getting left in their houses because we just don't have any room.' Perth woman Ali Readhead has been working in Sierra Leone for two years, and more recently has seen the devastating effect the Ebola outbreak is having on the region . In the capital city, Freetown, there are only 30 beds available to those with Ebola, despite there being thousands of people infected or suspected to have contracted the potentially fatal virus. 'They're just waiting for people to die to free up the beds,' Ms Readhead said. Ms Readhead originally moved to Freetown to work on the women and children's health policy, but when Ebola began to spread received a direct request from the Minister of Health in Sierra Leone to help fight the disease. But she believed the only real way to contain the virus was if Australia and other nations sent expert military medical teams to set up field hospitals and isolation centres, two things which Freetown need so desperately. 'The only way we have a chance of containing this outbreak is if we deploy military', Ms Readhead said before adding that they would be able to accommodate a level of risk humanitarian aid can't. The aid worker has started a petition which has already garnered over 33,000 signatures, urging Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to do more than financially support the situation. The disease is spreading fast without the appropriate resources to contain those infected . Ali (centre) seen here at the christening of her god-daughter, said it is impossible to contain Ebola without expert military medical teams from Australia, the UK and the US . 'I've never been more devastated in my life. Last week I returned to Perth after working with the health ministry in Sierra Leone – witnessing first hand how the deadly Ebola virus is spiralling out of control and killing hundreds.' 'It's terrifying, and to be honest I'm not sure anyone knows when or how it'll end. What I saw will stay with me forever – in some places there aren't enough ambulances to pick up those infected or bury the dead,' Ms Readhead wrote on Change.org. Just last week there was a direct request made by the government in Sierra Leone to Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Ms Readhead said she believes there is hesitation in sending personnel overseas as there is a risk of infection. The reality is less than ten aid workers have contracted Ebola, and if isolation facilities were set up alongside US and the UK in West Africa treatment would be incredibly easy. Ms Readhead also revealed the wider devastation the spread of Ebola was having on the community, economy, and already struggling healthcare system. In Sierra Leone there are only 30 beds available for Ebola patients, so hundreds more are forced to stay at home until people die and free up space in the hospitals . Ms Readhead (centre) celebrated Australia day with fellow countrymen in Freetown this year . People are terrified to visit hospitals, which is having devastating effects on the number of people accessing the health facilites, a problem the region has already been battling with for years. 'Pregnant ladies are giving birth at home, if your baby has malaria you don't take them to the hospital', Ms Readhead revealed. 'The hospitals are empty beside Ebola patients.' She also told of how tough the struggle was to break down the stigma around accessing healthcare services, and how the disease is quickly unravelling all the hard work. One in eight women died during childbirth before the government introduced free healthcare for pregnant women. This is worst outbreak of Ebola the region has ever seen, and the first time it has appeared in such an urban and highly populated area. The country's government burial team is seen here carrying the coffin of Dr Modupeh Cole, Sierra Leone's second senior physician to die of Ebola . Fellow Australian Jo Dunlop (left) and British doctor Oliver Johnson have been fighting alongside Ms Readhead (centre) to keep Freetown's main isolation centre open . If it is not contained soon, the projection is grim. Authorities believe it could spread to more than 1.4 million people across the region if urgent and desperately needed help is not received. The reason the virus is spreading so quickly is the close communities without standalone houses and the close proximity of marketplaces with many people packed into them allow it to spread with much greater ease. 'We don't have that level of contact in Australia... (and) we've got the medical expertise to be able to put in place the correct procedures', Ms Readhead said when asked if Ebola could post a threat to her home country. Despite the devastating health implications, the aid worker insisted there is much more at stake than the terrible loss of life. Ms Readhead ran the Sierra Leone marathon last year with her mum there to show her support . Already unstable economies in the region are likely to crumble under the pressure, and this process has already begun . Already unstable economies in the region are likely to crumble under the pressure, and this process has already begun. Mining companies completing projects in West Africa have pulled workers out of the area in fear of Ebola, and others with 'investments in the pipelines are being disbanded.' The disease has already claimed hundreds of lives in countries in the area, and could claim many more if urgent action is not taken, Ms Readhead warned. 'It can definitely be contained... if we have beds for suspected or confirmed patients, healthworkers who are able to treat them. 'Unless we have those two things on the ground we don't stand a chance.' On Thursday evening the World Bank announced they would be providing a further $190 million AUD to go towards fighting the deadly virus outbreak.","Australia woman Ali Readhead has been in Sierra Leone for two years .

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 06:29 EST, 21 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:37 EST, 21 February 2013 . New details: Secret documents have revealed that Jimmy Savile gave money to children and claimed it back on BBC expenses . Jimmy Savile made several secret payments to children at the height of his offending and managed to claim the cash back from the BBC as expenses, it was revealed today. Confidential documents show the paedophile handed £10 to three youngsters in 1974 - worth around £72 today - after they had appeared on his Clunk Click TV show. Savile, who was being paid the huge sum of £2,350 for every show he presented, demanded the money back and the Corporation obliged and never asked why he paid the children. A letter, dated April 18 1974, shows the transactions and has today been released by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act. 'We understand from London that during the above programme [Clunk Click] you dispersed £10 each to the following young people [names blanked out],' it says. 'We therefore enclose our cheque for £30 to reimburse you.' The payments were during the peak period of his predatory attacks, between 1966 and 1976, when he was aged between 40 and 50. In 1974 alone there were 30 occasions where he allegedly sexually abused both children and adults. Since October there have been 450 complaints to police about him - 214 have been recorded as crimes. His earliest offence was in Manchester in 1955, and the final reported allegation was in 2009 when he was aged 82. Some were allegedly attacked on BBC premises, including in his dressing room and the caravan he kept in the Television Centre car park in London. Concerns: Savile paid the youngsters in 1974, during his most prolific period of abuse, when he allegedly attacked people at BBC Television Centre (pictured) But despite abusing all over Britain he was never brought to justice even though police had chances to prosecute him while the DJ was alive. Yesterday it was revealed an officer from West Yorkshire Police is to be investigated after being accused of contacting Surrey Police on the DJ's behalf before they interviewed Savile over three alleged sex crimes in 2009. The reasons for these new secret payments to Clunk Click children are a mystery, but the BBC maintains there is no evidence that the youngsters were victims. A BBC spokeswoman told MailOnline: 'The document shows Savile was reimbursed the sum of £30 but there are no further details about this transaction which took place over 40 years ago'. Show: Sir Jimmy Savile is shown presenting his programme 'Clunk Click' alongside guest Max Bowker. It is not known which children Savile paid nearly 40 years ago . But the solicitor representing victims said the cash could be something more worrying. 'The payments could be deeply sinister, or it could just be that Savile was tight,' Alan Collins from the Pannone law firm told the Daily Express. 'We know he met kids in cafes and perhaps bought them drinks, but I can’t think why he would want to reimburse himself. 'It is well known he was reportedly tight-fisted, but given what we have learned over the past few months, one has got to keep an open mind about this.' The FOI shows other expenses claims he made when he was at the Corporation. It appears he demanded a new suit for every show he presented and asked for, and was given, an £1,800 pay rise per show in 1990 to allow for inflation - a huge sum at the time. He also asked for £200 travelling expenses for every programme because he lived in northern England, not London. A memo in 1989 said: 'Perhaps predictably Jimmy has raised the question of expenses using the argument that although he maintains a flat in London, he is now principally resident in Leeds.'","DJ gave £10 each - £72 today - to 3 young people on his Clunk Click show .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The judge overseeing the Mel Gibson child custody case ordered a probe into the leak of sealed court documents published on celebrity news website TMZ, a lawyer in the case said.

Lawyers involved in the case had copies, but Garbus suggested the leaked papers likely ""came out of the courthouse.""

"Dafniya, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan rebels and troops loyal to Moammar Gadhafi shelled each other for hours on Saturday in clashes at the highly contested frontline of Dafniya, an embattled town just west of the besieged port city of Misrata. At least 11 rebels were wounded in the exchange of fire and treated at one of the two field hospitals in what has been the most active day in Dafniya this week, according to a CNN team. Heavy government shelling on Misrata and Dafniya began shortly after Gadhafi rallied his supporters in an audio message on state TV and threatened to take the fighting to Europe in retaliation for NATO's bombing campaign. ""As soon as Gadhafi's speech ended, they started shelling Dafniya and around midnight there was a salvo of about eight rockets inside Misrata itself, and it continues on the front this morning,"" said CNN's Ben Wedeman, who was in Misrata Saturday. Gadhafi has vowed vengeance for NATO bombings in Libya. He said the Libyan military could be ""like locusts, like bees"" in Europe, potentially targeting homes and offices. ""You are mistaken, you are involved in a battle that you don't know what you are going to face, so withdraw and run away,"" Gadhafi told a pro-government gathering in Tripoli. ""Our people is able in one day to move the battle to the Mediterranean, and able to move the battle to Europe."" Gadhafi referred to NATO, which began bombing military targets in Libya after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution in March authorizing force by whatever means necessary -- with the exception of a ground invasion -- to protect civilians. Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim on Saturday reiterated Gadhafi's call for vengeance. NATO's ""aggression is killing our children (and) Europe will have to face the consequences,"" he said. ""You will have people attacking Europe, joining terrorist organizations against Europe, and building a culture that makes legitimate all violence against Europe."" Ibrahim claimed rebel fighters ""have no popular support."" ""The rebels have no future,"" he added. ""They know it and they are terrified."" On Saturday,  U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the NATO mission in Libya is on track, with pressure on Gadhafi mounting and the rebel forces growing stronger. ""We need to see this through, and we are in complete agreement that we will,"" she said alongside the Spanish foreign minister in Madrid Saturday. In Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States was taking seriously the Libyan leader's remarks. ""Certainly this is an individual who's obviously capable of carrying out these kinds of threats,"" he told reporters. ""It's what makes him so dangerous.  But he's also someone who's given to overblown rhetoric."" He said the United States would continue to support NATO's mission of increasing pressure on Gadhafi to step aside. The events came one day after the African Union's special committee on Libya said it had officially presented a plan meant to help Libya find a way out of the current crisis. The proposal states that Gadhafi will not be part of the negotiation process, but stops short of saying he should step down. ""It is envisaged to convene, soon, in Addis Ababa, (Ethiopia) negotiations between the parties to discuss these proposals,"" the group said in a statement. Committee members have met with Gadhafi and opposition leaders over the past three months. Another African Union-led attempt to broker peace between Gadhafi and the rebels fell through in April. The French government was in talks with Libyan rebels about supplying them with weapons and ammunition, a Libyan opposition military spokesman in Misrata said Thursday. The French government has not confirmed the claim, which follows an acknowledgment earlier this week that its military has previously dropped light weaponry to rebels elsewhere. CNN's Ben Wedeman and David McKenzie contributed to this report.","NEW: The African Union calls for talks between rebels and the government .

"In the last few years, the beard has had a renaissance. No longer just the preserve of tramps and lumberjacks, it is now seen on lawyers, bar staff and artists across the western world who have wanted to add a bit of edge to their look. The move has not gone unnoticed by the fairer sex, many of whom are delighted at the new facial hair trend. So it can only be good news that a new dating website has emerged, specifically linking up beard lovers with men who have beards. Scroll down for video . New dating website Bristlr matches beard lovers to men with beards. The site launched six weeks ago and it already has tens of thousands of users . John Kershaw from Manchester launched Bristlr six weeks ago and already tens of thousands of people have signed up. He started the project as a bit of a joke after suggesting the idea on Facebook and seeing a positive response from his friends. The (bearded) 28-year-old software developer said: 'When I posted the question on my Facebook page, my friends said they thought it was a really good idea. 'So  I made this fake landing site where people could sign up to this app that didn't really exist, just because I was curious to see how far people would go with it.' In the last week alone, more than 10,000 new people signed up to the site . He continued: 'I wanted to see who was willing to go through the hassle of signing up, giving their email address, etc. 'After 100 people signed up in four days, I thought there must be some scope, so I made a proper website and launched  it four weeks ago. 'It has kind of got a little bit out of hand at this moment, so I'm just kind of going with it, which is great fun.' John Kershaw from Manchester launched Bristlr six weeks ago . In the last week alone, more than 10,000 new people signed up to the site and when the IOS and Android apps are launched in a couple of weeks, those numbers are likely to grow even faster. John admits he can't believe how successful it has been so far, especially as it started out as a bit of a joke. He said: 'We are comfortably in the five figures now. It does surprise me because I'm very cynical and I think it is such a stupid idea that no one is going to want to do it. 'But it turns out that actually, people think it's kind of cool. I've started to talk to the people using it, and some say that it is the best dating site they've ever used. 'I think it's the fact that instead of it being this serious business like “Hey, if you click this button we're going to do this serious thing,” it's more like “Hey, I like your beard.” 'It’s light-hearted - you can't take it too seriously, which I think is really appealing to people. I did build a block button just in case though, because inevitably there are going to be creepy dudes. 'I’m sure there will also be guys who go on there without beards to try and pick up women, but they're not going to have much luck.' The site uses a minimal amount of information from users, so as not to be too invasive. But it does keep a tally of people with beards and people who love beards - the ratio is almost 50:50. John said: 'I've been quite surprised by the ratio of beards to people looking for beards.' The site keeps a tally of people with beards and people who love beards - the ratio is almost 50:50 . 'We don't track whether people are male or female, just whether or not they have a beard or they are looking for someone with a beard - we track the import stuff. 'It's just under half of people who have beards on Bristlr. 'I think I was expecting it to be 90 per cent people with beards.' That isn't the only surprise, John is also amazed by the different countries around the world where the site has already become a hit. He said: 'It's only international by chance - because I was too lazy to limit it when I was building the site.' The site is already in the UK, Holland, Canada and the US . He continued: ''It's really big in Holland and I had someone from Montreal today tell me it is now getting quite big over there, which is ridiculous. 'San Francisco was one of the first cities to embrace it. 'It's catching on slowly in New York, but I feel like they're slightly more cynical about it.' John admits that it may just be a craze while the beard trend lasts, but he is enjoying it while it does. He said: 'I know beards are definitely in, people have realised they are kind of lovely. Keep it neat. Invest in some nice beard oil, get a good pair of trimmers and just experiment. If you feel good in your beard then that comes across as confidence. A good beard doesn’t replace your personality but it does compliment it. 'I get that it is personal preference, just like some people like short hair and some like it long. 'I know some people who are repulsed by beards and some people just love them. 'You can tell a lot about a man by his beard, not that they just have one, because they may have just forgotten to shave. 'But just like seeing someone with a really nice suit or haircut, a nice well-kept beard shows some pride in appearance.'","Site launched six weeks ago and it already has tens of thousands of users .

"(CNN) -- Is it a thing or once again a show of a whole bunch of nothing? Reports are circulating about ""Seinfeld"" costars Jerry Seinfeld and Jason Alexander after they were spotted outside Tom's Restaurant in New York on Monday. Better known to ""Seinfeld"" fans as Monks, it's a spot that the popular NBC series helped make famous after shots of its exterior were used in the show.

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- Five hundred kids screamed when singer Ne-Yo walked in on their holiday party on a recent Saturday bearing gifts and a message of hope. ""This is the first famous person I actually met,"" exclaimed Tha Banks, 16, with a huge smile. Banks, a sports fan, got a new football autographed by the R&B superstar. Banks isn't Ne-Yo's typical fan -- he and the other teens at the party are part of Florida's foster care system, all seeking a life free from neglect and abuse. For the past five years, Shaffer ""Ne-Yo"" Smith has visited underprivileged children across the country, bringing toys, games, shoes and clothing as part of his charity's annual ""giving tour."" Ne-Yo and his mother, who is president of his foundation, recently visited six cities in six days, bringing Christmas gifts to more than 3,000 kids at Boys and Girls clubs, group homes and in foster care. He also talks to the children about his personal experiences. ""I grew up pretty much like you all,"" Ne-Yo told the teens at the central Florida foster home. ""We didn't have a lot of anything ... there was no silver spoon in my mouth."" A father of two himself, Ne-Yo said he sees his children in the faces of the kids he meets at these events. ""It's hard for me to fathom any parent that would abandon their kids for whatever reason,"" said Ne-Yo, the father of a 1-year-old and a 3-month-old. ""That doesn't compute with me."" The holiday party was organized by the Kids House of Seminole County, which cares for 2,300 kids each year between the ages of 3 and 18, including victims of neglect, and others who witness domestic violence, or experience physical or sexual abuse, according to Marcie Dearth of Kids House. ""This is an annual party that kids host every year, but we never have had the celebrity presence that we did this year,"" Dearth said, calling Ne-Yo's visit ""a lifetime experience."" The kids frost cookies and decorate stockings for the holiday season -- a tough time for these children, who are separated from their families. ""These events help fill that void, that excitement of the holiday spirit that all kids should have,"" said John Cooper, assistant secretary of operations for the Florida Department of Children and Families. More than 400,000 children are in the foster care system in the United States, according to a 2010 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report. With about 19,000 kids in foster care, Florida has the fourth-largest number of kids in state care, behind California, New York and Texas, according to the 2010 report. At the party, volunteers handed out wrapped presents donated by Ne-Yo's charity, the Compound Foundation; Toys for Tots; Coca-Cola; Mattel; Ubisoft and other corporate partners. Destiny Molina, 15, unwraps her gift: a box filled with bottles of nail polish. ""You know what's funny,"" she says. ""The girls at the other (foster) house stole my other nail polish, and I have been trying to buy it back."" She turns to her friend to ask what she got. ""Makeup,"" replies Karla Hurtado, 16. ""Oh that's cute,"" Molina says. Molina said this was going to be a good Christmas, something that doesn't happen every year for children in foster care. ""We don't have Christmases like this all the time,"" she said, a little choked up. Ne-Yo told the room full of kids that he was living, breathing proof that you need to find something that you love to do and ""stick with it."" He said something that motivates yet frustrates him is hearing foster kids referred to as ""forgotten children."" ""All you need for success is drive, passion and one person to give a damn -- to give you a shot,"" Ne-Yo said. ""And you have a room full of people like that."" Mercedes Noble, 17, says she was grateful to meet Ne-Yo, who she said seemed to be a real person, just like her. The tall teen said foster care is not the best place to be at Christmas; everyone would rather be with their families. Noble said, though, ""It's way better to be here with people who love and care for us than be at home and probably getting beat."" With a big smile, the teen said, ""I appreciate that he took time out of his life and come and show respect to us, kindness -- let us know that we are still human, we are still people and we still need love.""","R&B star Ne-Yo brought holiday gifts to foster kids in six cities .

"Craig Weir, from Carnoustie, welcomed the Terminator star on to the stage at a business event in Edinburgh last week, while his brother Paul drummed.
The following night Craig joined The Libertines onstage at their show at Glasgow's SSE Hydro.
His run concluded at a charity event featuring the cast of Still Game.
Craig, 22, began his four-day run on Wednesday night at Edinburgh's EICC where ""The Governator"" was putting in a rare UK appearance at business event entitled ""An Experience with Arnold Schwarzenegger"".
Craig and his brother Paul, 18, met the movie star and had their photo taken with him following the event.
The piper said: ""The opportunity to welcome Arnold to Scotland for the first time was incredible and very surreal. He was very kind to us and was excited to hear the bagpipes played live in Scotland.""
The following night Craig renewed his acquaintance with Pete Doherty's band The Libertines, who he has played with before.
Craig joined the band to play Flower of Scotland as they walked on stage.
He said: ""It was amazing to play once more with my music heroes, The Libertines.
""The crowd response to it was amazing.
""The band were very welcoming once again and it was a great evening.""
Craig's Celtic rock band Gleadhraich played at a charity concert on Saturday in Stirling in aid of The Eilidh Brown Memorial Fund, which is building a respite holiday home for young people and their families fighting cancer.
The bill included The Voice winner Stevie McCrorie, The Fratellis and the cast of BBC Scotland comedy Still Game.

"NSW Premier Mike Baird said he experimented with cannabis in his youth . Recently appointed NSW Premier Mike Baird has admitted to experimenting with Cannabis during an interview that canvasses his support for legalising the drug. The devout Christian and father of three, who succeeded former premier Barry O'Farrell in April, said he had used cannabis as a young person but was quick to dismiss it had any part to play in his life - other than as a one-off experiment. The Premier told the Daily Telegraph in an interview to mark his 100th day since being thrust into the state's top job, 'we've all been young, so I'm not going to deny I did experiment in my youth.' He made the remark when quizzed about decriminalising the drug for medicinal purposes in NSW, but said his own experience with drug-taking was neither 'pleasant' nor 'regular'. 'It's got nothing to do with this issue anyway.' Mike Baird supports legalising marijuana in NSW to help people cope with terminal illness . Daniel, pictured with his mother Lucy Haslam, has found relief in cannabis during chemotherapy and a campaign to legalise the drug for terminally ill patients by his parents has more than 188,000 signatures . The premier, and a number of NSW MPs, have given in-principle support for legalising marijuana for terminally ill patients in the state after Mr Baird visited a Tamworth cancer patient. Daniel Haslam, a 24-year-old, was told in 2010 that he only had months to live but begun taking cannabis as a pain coping mechanism to help him deal with the disease. He has made vast improvements in his health, his mother - a former head the north west NSW  drug squad said, and she is now asking politicians to legalise the controversial drug. Mr Baird said he was 'struck with Daniel and the battle he's in' after meeting with him. 'It's heart-wrenching,' he said. 'I've got deep sympathy and empathy with their position.' Clinical trials of medicinal cannabis could happen in NSW, but Mr Baird is waiting on details about regulation and supply before making any commitments. Under a private member's bill to be introduced next month by Nationals MP Kevin Anderson, terminally ill people and their carers will be legally able to carry up to 15 grams of cannabis. Tamworth man Daniel Haslam is in a four-year battle with terminal bowel cancer and his parents are calling for cannabis to be legalised for treatment by the terminally ill . Asked if he would support a clinical trial, as proposed by the Australian Medical Association, Mr Baird said 'it may well be something we have to do'. 'I'm open to that,' he told ABC Radio on Thursday. But Mr Baird is waiting to see details of the bill and whether it will address his concerns about the sale and regulation of the drug. But if the bill satisfies Mr Baird, it seems likely Daniel and his family won't be forced to break the law for much longer. 'If we can provide relief to them in those circumstance, well, what premier would not want to do that?"" Mr Baird said. NSW Opposition Leader John Robertson said he's willing to work with the government but, like Mr Baird, wanted to see how the bill addresses things such as supply and access before fully endorsing it. 'I'm not writing a blank cheque, but I am very supportive of his notion,"" he told reporters on last week. 'If marijuana is part of the solution to dealing with those issues as a means of relieving people's pain, then we should be looking at that.'","Mr Baird made the remark in an interview on his 100th day as premier .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- While President Obama takes plenty of heat over his plans to overhaul domestic policies, critics have also taken aim at his foreign policy approach, particularly as it relates to human rights around the globe. Human Rights Watch advocacy director Tom Malinowski says Obama should have met with the Dalai Lama. Human Rights Watch advocacy director Tom Malinowski said Wednesday that while the administration appeared to have ""gotten the balance right"" on Myanmar, the military junta-ruled Asian nation formerly known as Burma, by starting a dialogue while maintaining sanctions, ""China is a different matter."" ""And that's where we've seen the tension play out in the most acute way, with several signals that have been sent suggesting that the administration is putting human rights issues to one side,"" Malinowski said on CNN's ""Amanpour."" ""And most recently, the, I think, symbolic mistake of the president declining to meet the Dalai Lama before his own visit to China later next month.""  Watch the discussion » . The Tibetan spiritual leader, who fled to India in 1959 and established a government in exile there, visited the United States earlier this month. China considers Tibet a renegade province and accuses the Dalai Lama of inciting violence. The timing of a presidential meeting with the Dalai Lama is considered largely symbolic, and Malinowski said the president's delay ""sent a message to the Chinese government that perhaps this isn't as high a priority for the United States as it has been in the past."" Malinowski also criticized the U.S. special envoy to Sudan, retired Air Force Maj. J. Scott Gration, who had suggested wooing the Sudanese government with ""cookies"" and ""gold stars, smiley faces, handshakes, agreements, talk, engagement"" to change its attitude about Darfur, where genocide and famine have killed hundreds of thousands of people. ""It's a really dumb thing to say,"" said Malinowski, who previously served in the administration of President Clinton. ""Governments like this, they are not children, and they do not react to cookies and gold stars,"" he said. ""They act on their interests, and historically, as you know from Bosnia, to all the places where we have successfully defeated this kind of violence, governments respond to pressure."" Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, a candidate for re-election next year, has been indicted on war-crimes charges by the International Criminal Court. Despite Gration's comments, the Obama administration has not yet articulated a Sudan policy. But Louise Arbour, president of the International Crisis Group and a former U.N. human rights commissioner, told ""Amanpour"" that talking rather than pressuring governments over human rights can be beneficial. ""If you have a policy of engagement, which I think very much is the one put forward by the Obama administration, you may give an impression that you're softening,"" said Arbour, who is also a former war crimes prosecutor. ""It's very easy to look tough, right? You don't talk to anybody, you repudiate everything, you slam all the doors and you accomplish nothing, or very little. And we have a lot of precedence for that. ""When you have a policy of reinforcing diplomatic initiatives, engagement, it may look soft, because you have to put on the table a multiplicity of issues, not just a single one. But on balance, I think there's more chance on some of these ... all important initiatives than just by looking tough and achieving nothing."" Arbour added, however, that the engagement approach to human rights abuses will not create fast change from the abusive regimes. Noting the glacial pace of transformation in Myanmar, where democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has been held under house arrest for nearly two decades, Arbour said ""it's going to be very slow."" ""You can't have 20 years of extremely adversarial, confrontational posturing, and then say, well, we're ready to talk and be friendly, and assume that the other side's going to roll over,"" she said. ""It's just not going to work that way."" ""There have to be very slow processes, but I think Aung San Suu Kyi herself has been encouraging more engagement. She wants to have contact with the junta and with foreigners, and it's happening. These are small steps. They're certainly in the right direction.""","Good start in Myanmar, China problematic, says Human Rights Watch official .
